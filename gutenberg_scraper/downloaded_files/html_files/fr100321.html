  The House Of A Kentish Squire</b></h2>
  <p>Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy folded his hands before him ere he spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! but I tell thee, woman, that the Lord hath no love for such
  frivolities! and alack! but &rsquo;tis a sign of the times that an English
  Squire should favor such evil ways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Evil ways? The Lord love you, Master Hymn-of-Praise, and pray do
  you call half an hour at the skittle alley &lsquo;evil ways&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, evil it is to indulge our sinful bodies in such recreation as
  doth not tend to the glorification of the Lord and the sanctification of
  our immortal souls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He who sermonized thus unctuously and with eyes fixed with stern disapproval
  on the buxom wench before him, was a man who had passed the meridian of life
  not altogether&mdash;it may be surmised&mdash;without having indulged in
  some recreations which had not always the sanctification of his own immortal
  soul for their primary object. The bulk of his figure testified that he was
  not averse to good cheer, and there was a certain hidden twinkle underlying
  the severe expression of his eyes as they rested on the pretty face and round
  figure of Mistress Charity that did not necessarily tend to the glorification
  of the Lord.</p>
  <p>Apparently, however, the admonitions of Master Hymn-of-Praise made but a
  scanty impression on the young girl&rsquo;s mind, for she regarded him with
  a mixture of amusement and contempt as she shrugged her plump shoulders and
  said with sudden irrelevance:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you had your dinner yet, Master Busy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis sinful to address a single Christian person as if he or
  she were several,&rdquo; retorted the man sharply. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll
  tell thee in confidence, mistress, that I have not partaken of a single drop
  more comforting than cold water the whole of to-day. Mistress de Chavasse
  mixed the sack-posset with her own hands this morning, and locked it in the
  cellar, of which she hath rigorously held the key. Ten minutes ago when she
  placed the bowl on this table, she called my attention to the fact that the
  delectable beverage came to within three inches of the brim. Meseems I shall
  have to seek for a less suspicious, more Christian-spirited household, whereon
  to bestow in the near future my faithful services.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hardly had Master Hymn-of-Praise finished speaking when he turned very sharply
  round and looked with renewed sternness&mdash;wholly untempered by a twinkle
  this time&mdash;in the direction whence he thought a suppressed giggle had
  just come to his ears. But what he saw must surely have completely reassured
  him; there was no suggestion of unseemly ribaldry about the young lad who
  had been busy laying out the table with spoons and mugs, and was at this
  moment vigorously&mdash;somewhat ostentatiously, perhaps&mdash;polishing
  a carved oak chair, bending to his task in a manner which fully accounted
  for the high color in his cheeks.</p>
  <p>He had long, lanky hair of a pale straw-color, a thin face and high cheek-bones,
  and was dressed&mdash;as was also Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy&mdash;in a dark
  purple doublet and knee breeches, all looking very much the worse for wear;
  the brown tags and buttons with which these garments had originally been
  roughly adorned were conspicuous in a great many places by their absence,
  whilst all those that remained were mere skeletons of their former selves.</p>
  <p>The plain collars and cuffs which relieved the dull color of the men&rsquo;s
  doublets were of singularly coarse linen not beyond reproach as to cleanliness,
  and altogether innocent of starch; whilst the thick brown worsted stockings
  displayed many a hole through which the flesh peeped, and the shoes of roughly
  tanned leather were down at heel and worn through at the toes.</p>
  <p>Undoubtedly even in these days of more than primitive simplicity and of
  sober habiliments Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy, butler at Acol Court in the
  county of Kent, and his henchman, Master Courage Toogood, would have been
  conspicuous for the shabbiness and poverty of the livery which they wore.</p>
  <p>The hour was three in the afternoon. Outside a glorious July sun spread
  radiance and glow over an old-fashioned garden, over tall yew hedges, and
  fantastic forms of green birds and heads of beasts carefully cut and trimmed,
  over clumps of late roses and rough tangles of marguerites and potentillas,
  of stiff zinnias and rich-hued snapdragons.</p>
  <p>Through the open window came the sound of wood knocking against wood, of
  exclamations of annoyance or triumph as the game proceeded, and every now
  and then a ripple of prolonged laughter, girlish, fresh, pure as the fragrant
  air, clear as the last notes of the cuckoo before he speaks his final farewell
  to summer.</p>
  <p>Every time that echo of youth and gayety penetrated into the oak-raftered
  dining-room, Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy pursed his thick lips in disapproval,
  whilst the younger man, had he dared, would no doubt have gone to the window,
  and leaning out as far as safety would permit, have tried to catch a glimpse
  of the skittle alley and of a light-colored kirtle gleaming among the trees.
  But as it was he caught the older man&rsquo;s stern eyes fixed reprovingly
  upon him, he desisted from his work of dusting and polishing, and, looking
  up to the heavy oak-beam above him, he said with becoming fervor:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord! how beautifully thou dost speak, Master Busy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get on with thy work, Master Courage,&rdquo; retorted the other relentlessly, &ldquo;and
  mix not thine unruly talk with the wise sayings of thy betters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My work is done, Master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go fetch the pasties then, the quality will be in directly,&rdquo; rejoined
  the other peremptorily, throwing a scrutinizing look at the table, whereon
  a somewhat meager collation of cherries, raspberries and gooseberries and
  a more generous bowl of sack-posset had been arranged by Mistress Charity
  and Master Courage under his own supervision.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doubtless, doubtless,&rdquo; here interposed the young maid somewhat
  hurriedly, desirous perhaps of distracting the grave butler&rsquo;s attention
  from the mischievous oglings of the lad as he went out of the room, &ldquo;as
  you remark&mdash;hem&mdash;as thou remarkest, this place of service is none
  to the liking of such as ... thee ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She threw him a coy glance from beneath well-grown lashes, which caused
  the saintly man to pass his tongue over his lips, an action which of a surety
  had not the desire for spiritual glory for its mainspring. With dainty hands
  Mistress Charity busied herself with the delicacies upon the table. She adjusted
  a gooseberry which seemed inclined to tumble, heaped up the currants into
  more graceful pyramids. Womanlike, whilst her eyes apparently followed the
  motions of her hands they nevertheless took stock of Master Hymn-of-Praise&rsquo;s
  attitude with regard to herself.</p>
  <p>She knew that in defiance of my Lord Protector and all his Puritans she
  was looking her best this afternoon: though her kirtle was as threadbare
  as Master Courage&rsquo;s breeches it was nevertheless just short enough
  to display to great advantage her neatly turned ankle and well-arched foot
  on which the thick stockings&mdash;well-darned&mdash;and shabby shoes sat
  not at all amiss.</p>
  <p>Her kerchief was neatly folded, white and slightly starched, her cuffs immaculately
  and primly turned back just above her round elbow and shapely arm.</p>
  <p>On the whole Mistress Charity was pleased with her own appearance. Sir Marmaduke
  de Chavasse and the mistress were seeing company this afternoon, and the
  neighboring Kentish squires who had come to play skittles and to drink sack-posset
  might easily find a less welcome sight than that of the serving maid at Acol
  Court.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As for myself,&rdquo; now resumed Mistress Charity, after a slight
  pause, during which she had felt Master Busy&rsquo;s admiring gaze fixed
  persistently upon her, &ldquo;as for myself, I&rsquo;ll seek service with
  a lady less like to find such constant fault with a hard-working maid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Master Courage had just returned carrying a large dish heaped up with delicious
  looking pasties fresh from the oven, brown and crisp with butter, and ornamented
  with sprigs of burrage which made them appear exceedingly tempting.</p>
  <p>Charity took the dish from the lad and heavy as it was, she carried it to
  the table and placed it right in the very center of it. She rearranged the
  sprigs of burrage, made a fresh disposition of the baskets of fruit, whilst
  both the men watched her open-mouthed, agape at so much loveliness and grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; she added significantly, looking with ill-concealed covetousness
  at the succulent pasties, &ldquo;where there&rsquo;s at least one dog or
  cat about the place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know not, mistress,&rdquo; said Hymn-of-Praise, &ldquo;that thou
  wast over-fond of domestic pets ... &rsquo;Tis sinful to ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;La! Master Busy, you ... hem ... thou mistakest my meaning. I have
  no love for such creatures&mdash;but without so much as a kitten about the
  house, prithee how am I to account to my mistress for the pasties and ...
  and comfits ... not to speak of breakages.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is always Master Courage,&rdquo; suggested Hymn-of-Praise,
  with a movement of the left eyelid which in the case of any one less saintly
  might have been described as a sly wink.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That there is not,&rdquo; interrupted the lad decisively; &ldquo;my
  stomach rebels against comfits, and sack-posset could never be laid to my
  door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I give thee assurance, Master Busy,&rdquo; concluded the young girl, &ldquo;that
  the county of Kent no longer suits my constitution. &rsquo;Tis London for
  me, and thither will I go next year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a den of wickedness,&rdquo; commented Busy sententiously, &ldquo;in
  spite of my Lord Protector, who of a truth doth turn his back on the Saints
  and hath even allowed the great George Fox and some of the Friends to languish
  in prison, whilst profligacy holds undisputed sway. Master Courage, meseems
  those mugs need washing a second time,&rdquo; he added, with sudden irrelevance. &ldquo;Take
  them to the kitchen, and do not let me set eyes on thee until they shine
  like pieces of new silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Master Courage would have either resisted the order altogether, or at any
  rate argued the point of the cleanliness of the mugs, had he dared; but the
  saintly man possessed on occasions a heavy hand, and he also wore boots which
  had very hard toes, and the lad realized from the peremptory look in the
  butler&rsquo;s eyes that this was an occasion when both hand and boot would
  serve to emphasize Master Busy&rsquo;s orders with unpleasant force if he
  himself were at all slow to obey.</p>
  <p>He tried to catch Charity&rsquo;s eye, but was made aware once more of the
  eternal truth that women are perverse and fickle creatures, for she would
  not look at him, and seemed absorbed in the rearrangement of her kerchief.</p>
  <p>With a deep sigh which should have spoken volumes to her adamantine heart,
  Courage gathered all the mugs together by their handles, and reluctantly
  marched out of the room once more.</p>
  <p>Hymn-of-Praise Busy waited a moment or two until the clattering of the pewter
  died away in the distance, then he edged a little closer to the table whereat
  Mistress Charity seemed still very busy with the fruit, and said haltingly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didst thou really wish to go, mistress ... to leave thy fond, adoring
  Hymn-of-Praise ... to go, mistress? ... and to break my heart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Charity&rsquo;s dainty head&mdash;with its tiny velvet cap edged with lawn
  which hardly concealed sufficiently the wealth of her unruly brown hair&mdash;sank
  meditatively upon her left shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord, Master Busy,&rdquo; she said demurely, &ldquo;how was a poor
  maid to know that you meant it earnestly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meant it earnestly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes ... a new kirtle ... a gold ring ... flowers ... and sack-posset
  and pasties to all the guests,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Is that what
  you mean ... hem ... what <i>thou,</i> meanest, Master Busy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of a surety, mistress ... and if thou wouldst allow me to ... to
  ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To what, Master Busy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To salute thee,&rdquo; said the saintly man, with a becoming blush, &ldquo;as
  the Lord doth allow his creatures to salute one another ... with a chaste
  kiss, mistress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as she seemed to demur, he added by way of persuasion:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not altogether a poor man, mistress; and there is that in my
  coffer upstairs put by, as would please thee in the future.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! I was not thinking of the money, Master Busy,&rdquo; said this
  daughter of Eve, coyly, as she held a rosy cheek out in the direction of
  the righteous man.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Tis the duty even of a veracious chronicler to draw a discreet veil
  over certain scenes full of blissful moments for those whom he portrays.</p>
  <p>There are no data extant as to what occurred during the next few seconds
  in the old oak-beamed dining-room of Acol Court in the Island of Thanet.
  Certain it is that when next we get a peep at Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy
  and Mistress Charity Haggett, they are standing side by side, he looking
  somewhat shame-faced in the midst of his obvious joy, and she supremely unconcerned,
  once more absorbed in the apparently never-ending adornment of the refreshment
  table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;lt have no cause to regret this, mistress,&rdquo; said
  Busy complacently, &ldquo;we will be married this very autumn, and I have
  it in my mind&mdash;an it please the Lord&mdash;to go up to London and take
  secret service under my Lord Protector himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Secret service, Master Busy ... hem ... I mean Hymn-of-Praise, dear
  ... secret service? ... What may that be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a noble business, Charity,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and
  one highly commended by the Lord: the business of tracking the wicked to
  their lair, of discovering evil where &rsquo;tis hidden in dark places, conspiracies
  against my Lord Protector, adherence to the cause of the banished tyrants
  and ... and ... so forth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sounds like spying to me,&rdquo; she remarked curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spying? ... Spying, didst thou say?&rdquo; he exclaimed indignantly. &ldquo;Fie
  on thee, Charity, for the thought! Secret service under my Lord Protector &rsquo;tis
  called, and a highly lucrative business too, and one for which I have remarkable
  aptitude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! See the manner in which I find things out, mistress. This house
  now ... thou wouldst think &rsquo;tis but an ordinary house ... eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His manner changed; the saintliness vanished from his attitude; the expression
  of his face became sly and knowing. He came nearer to Charity, took hold
  of her wrist, whilst he raised one finger to his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou wouldst think &rsquo;tis an ordinary house ... wouldst thou
  not?&rdquo; he repeated, sinking his voice to a whisper, murmuring right
  into her ear so that his breath blew her hair about, causing it to tickle
  her cheek.</p>
  <p>She shuddered with apprehension. His manner was so mysterious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes ... yes ...&rdquo; she murmured, terrified.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I tell thee that there&rsquo;s something going on,&rdquo; he
  added significantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;La, Master Busy ... you ... you terrify me!&rdquo; she said, on the
  verge of tears. &ldquo;What could there be going on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Master Busy raised both his hands and with the right began counting off
  the fingers of the left.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Firstly,&rdquo; he began solemnly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an heiress!
  secondly our master&mdash;poor as a church mouse&mdash;thirdly a young scholar&mdash;secretary,
  they call him, though he writes no letters, and is all day absorbed in his
  studies ... Well, mistress,&rdquo; he concluded, turning a triumphant gaze
  on her, &ldquo;tell me, prithee, what happens?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What happens, Master Hymn-of-Praise? ... I do not understand. What
  does happen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell thee,&rdquo; he replied sententiously, &ldquo;when
  I have found out; but mark my words, mistress, there&rsquo;s something going
  on in this house ... Hush! not a word to that young jackanapes,&rdquo; he
  added as a distant clatter of pewter mugs announced the approach of Master
  Courage. &ldquo;Watch with me, mistress, thou&rsquo;lt perceive something.
  And when I have found out, &rsquo;twill be the beginning of our fortunes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more he placed a warning finger on his lips; once more he gave Mistress
  Charity a knowing wink, and her wrist an admonitory pressure, then he resumed
  his staid and severe manner, his saintly mien and somewhat nasal tones, as
  from the gay outside world beyond the window-embrasure the sound of many
  voices, the ripple of young laughter, the clink of heeled boots on the stone-flagged
  path, proclaimed the arrival of the quality.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  On A July Afternoon</b></h2>
  <p>In the meanwhile in a remote corner of the park the quality was assembled
  round the skittle-alley.</p>
  <p>Imagine Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse standing there, as stiff a Roundhead as
  ever upheld my Lord Protector and his Puritanic government in this remote
  corner of the county of Kent: dour in manner, harsh-featured and hollow-eyed,
  dressed in dark doublet and breeches wholly void of tags, ribands or buttons.
  His closely shorn head is flat at the back, square in front, his clean-shaven
  lips though somewhat thick are always held tightly pressed together. Not
  far from him sits on a rough wooden seat, Mistress Amelia Editha de Chavasse,
  widow of Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s elder brother, a good-looking woman still,
  save for the look of discontent, almost of suppressed rebellion, apparent
  in the perpetual dark frown between the straight brows, in the downward curve
  of the well-chiseled mouth, and in the lowering look which seems to dwell
  for ever in the handsome dark eyes.</p>
  <p>Dame Harrison, too, was there: the large and portly dowager, florid of face,
  dictatorial in manner, dressed in the supremely unbecoming style prevalent
  at the moment, when everything that was beautiful in art as well as in nature
  was condemned as sinful and ungodly; she wore the dark kirtle and plain,
  ungainly bodice with its hard white kerchief folded over her ample bosom;
  her hair was parted down the middle and brushed smoothly and flatly to her
  ears, where but a few curls were allowed to escape with well-regulated primness
  from beneath the horn-comb, and the whole appearance of her looked almost
  grotesque, surmounted as it was by the modish high-peaked beaver hat, a marvel
  of hideousness and discomfort, since the small brim afforded no protection
  against the sun, and the tall crown was a ready prey to the buffetings of
  the wind.</p>
  <p>Mistress Fairsoul Pyncheon too, was there, the wife of the Squire of Ashe;
  thin and small, a contrast to Dame Harrison in her mild and somewhat fussy
  manner; her plain petticoat, too, was embellished with paniers, and in spite
  of the heat of the day she wore a tippet edged with fur: both of which frivolous
  adornments had obviously stirred up the wrath of her more Puritanical neighbor.</p>
  <p>Then there were the men: busy at this moment with hurling wooden balls along
  the alley, at the further end of which a hollow-eyed scraggy youth, in shirt
  and rough linen trousers, was employed in propping up again the fallen nine-pins.
  Squire John Boatfield had ridden over from Eastry, Sir Timothy Harrison had
  come in his aunt&rsquo;s coach, and young Squire Pyncheon with his doting
  mother.</p>
  <p>And in the midst of all these sober folk, of young men in severe garments,
  of portly dames and frowning squires, a girlish figure, young, alert, vigorous,
  wearing with the charm of her own youth and freshness the unbecoming attire,
  which disfigured her elders yet seemed to set off her own graceful form,
  her dainty bosom and pretty arms. Her kirtle, too, was plain, and dull in
  color, of a soft dovelike gray, without adornment of any kind, but round
  her shoulders her kerchief was daintily turned, edged with delicate lace,
  and showing through its filmy folds peeps of her own creamy skin.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas years later that Sir Peter Lely painted Lady Sue when she was
  a great lady and the friend of the Queen: she was beautiful then, in the
  full splendor of her maturer charms, but never so beautiful as she was on
  that hot July afternoon in the year of our Lord 1657, when, heated with the
  ardor of the game, pleased undoubtedly with the adulation which surrounded
  her on every side, she laughed and chatted with the men, teased the women,
  her cheeks aglow, her eyes bright, her brown hair&mdash;persistently unruly&mdash;flying
  in thick curls over her neck and shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A remarkable talent, good Sir Marmaduke,&rdquo; Dame Harrison was
  saying to her host, as she cast a complacent eye on her nephew, who had just
  succeeded in overthrowing three nine-pins at one stroke: &ldquo;Sir Timothy
  hath every aptitude for outdoor pursuits, and though my Lord Protector deems
  all such recreations sinful, yet do I think they tend to the development
  of muscular energy, which later on may be placed at the service of the Commonwealth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Timothy Harrison at this juncture had the misfortune of expending his
  muscular energy in hitting Squire Boatfield violently on the shin with an
  ill-aimed ball.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; ejaculated the latter, heedless of the strict fines
  imposed by my Lord Protector on unseemly language. &ldquo;I ... verily beg
  the ladies&rsquo; pardon ... but ... this young jackanapes nearly broke my
  shin-bone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There certainly had been an exclamation of horror on the part of the ladies
  at Squire Boatfield&rsquo;s forcible expression of annoyance, Dame Harrison
  taking no pains to conceal her disapproval.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Horrid, coarse creature, this neighbor of yours, good Sir Marmaduke,&rdquo; she
  said with her usual air of decision. &ldquo;Meseems he is not fit company
  for your ward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear Squire Boatfield,&rdquo; sighed Mistress Pyncheon, who was evidently
  disposed to be more lenient, &ldquo;how good-humoredly he bears it! Clumsy
  people should not be trusted in a skittle alley,&rdquo; she added in a mild
  way, which seemed to be peculiarly exasperating to Dame Harrison&rsquo;s
  irascible temper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you, Sir Timothy,&rdquo; here interposed Lady Sue, trying
  to repress the laughter which would rise to her lips, &ldquo;forgive poor
  Squire John. You scarce can expect him to moderate his language under such
  provocation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! his insults leave me completely indifferent,&rdquo; said the
  young man with easy unconcern, &ldquo;his calling me a jackanapes doth not
  of necessity make me one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; retorted Squire Boatfield, who was still nursing his shin-bone, &ldquo;maybe
  not, Sir Timothy, but it shows how observant I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oliver, pick up Lady Sue&rsquo;s handkerchief,&rdquo; came in mild
  accents from Mistress Pyncheon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite unnecessary, good mistress,&rdquo; rejoined Dame Harrison decisively, &ldquo;Sir
  Timothy has already seen it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And while the two young men made a quick and not altogether successful dive
  for her ladyship&rsquo;s handkerchief, colliding vigorously with one another
  in their endeavor to perform this act of gallantry single-handed, Lady Sue
  gazed down on them, with good-humored contempt, laughter and mischief dancing
  in her eyes. She knew that she was good to look at, that she was rich, and
  that she had the pick of the county, aye, of the South of England, did she
  desire to wed. Perhaps she thought of this, even whilst she laughed at the
  antics of her bevy of courtiers, all anxious to win her good graces.</p>
  <p>Yet even as she laughed, her face suddenly clouded over, a strange, wistful
  look came into her eyes, and her laughter was lost in a quick, short sigh.</p>
  <p>A young man had just crossed the tiny rustic bridge which spanned the ha-ha
  dividing the flower-garden from the uncultivated park. He walked rapidly
  through the trees, towards the skittle alley, and as he came nearer, the
  merry lightheartedness seemed suddenly to vanish from Lady Sue&rsquo;s manner:
  the ridiculousness of the two young men at her feet, glaring furiously at
  one another whilst fighting for her handkerchief, seemed now to irritate
  her; she snatched the bit of delicate linen from their hands, and turned
  somewhat petulantly away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall we continue the game?&rdquo; she said curtly.</p>
  <p>The young man, all the while that he approached, had not taken his eyes
  off Lady Sue. Twice he had stumbled against rough bits of root or branch
  which he had not perceived in the grass through which he walked. He had seen
  her laughing gaily, whilst Squire Boatfield used profane language, and smile
  with contemptuous merriment at the two young men at her feet; he had also
  seen the change in her manner, the sudden wistful look, the quick sigh, the
  irritability and the petulance.</p>
  <p>But his own grave face expressed neither disapproval at the one mood nor
  astonishment at the other. He walked somewhat like a somnambulist, with eyes
  fixed&mdash;almost expressionless in the intensity of their gaze.</p>
  <p>He was very plainly, even poorly clad, and looked a dark figure even amongst
  these soberly appareled gentry. The grass beneath his feet had deadened the
  sound of his footsteps but Sir Marmaduke had apparently perceived him, for
  he beckoned to him to approach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Lambert?&rdquo; he asked kindly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your letter to Master Skyffington, Sir Marmaduke,&rdquo; replied
  the young man, &ldquo;will you be pleased to sign it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will it not keep?&rdquo; said Sir Marmaduke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, an you wish it, Sir. I fear I have intruded. I did not know
  you were busy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The young man had a harsh voice, and a strange brusqueness of manner which
  somehow suggested rebellion against the existing conditions of life. He no
  longer looked at Lady Sue now, but straight at Sir Marmaduke, speaking the
  brief apology between his teeth, without opening his mouth, as if the words
  hurt him when they passed his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had best speak to Master Skyffington himself about the business,&rdquo; rejoined
  Sir Marmaduke, not heeding the mumbled apology, &ldquo;he will be here anon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned abruptly away, and the young man once more left to himself, silently
  and mechanically moved again in the direction of the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will join us in a bowl of sack-posset, Master Lambert,&rdquo; said
  Mistress de Chavasse, striving to be amiable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; he said none too genially, &ldquo;in about
  half-an-hour if you will allow me. There is another letter yet to write.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No one had taken much notice of him. Even in these days when kingship and
  House of Lords were abolished, the sense of social inequality remained keen.
  To this coterie of avowed Republicans, young Richard Lambert&mdash;secretary
  or what-not to Sir Marmaduke, a paid dependent at any rate&mdash;was not
  worth more than a curt nod of the head, a condescending acknowledgment of
  his existence at best.</p>
  <p>But Lady Sue had not even bestowed the nod. She had not actually taken notice
  of his presence when he came; the wistful look had vanished as soon as the
  young man&rsquo;s harsh voice had broken on her ear: she did not look on
  him now that he went.</p>
  <p>She was busy with her game. Nathless her guardian&rsquo;s secretary was
  of no more importance in the rich heiress&rsquo;s sight than that mute row
  of nine-pins at the end of the alley, nor was there, mayhap, in her mind
  much social distinction between the hollow-eyed lad who set them up stolidly
  from time to time, and the silent young student who wrote those letters which
  Sir Marmaduke had not known how to spell.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  The Exile</b></h2>
  <p>But despite outward indifference, with the brief appearance of the soberly-garbed
  young student upon the scene and his abrupt and silent departure, all the
  zest seemed to have gone out of Lady Sue&rsquo;s mood.</p>
  <p>The ingenuous flatteries of her little court irritated her now: she no longer
  felt either amused or pleased by the extravagant compliments lavished upon
  her beauty and skill by portly Squire John, by Sir Timothy Harrison or the
  more diffident young Squire Pyncheon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of a truth, I sometimes wish, Lady Sue, that I could find out if
  you have any faults,&rdquo; remarked Squire Boatfield unctuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Squire,&rdquo; she retorted sharply, &ldquo;pray try to praise
  me to my female friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In vain did Mistress Pyncheon admonish her son to be more bold in his wooing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You behave like a fool, Oliver,&rdquo; she said meekly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Mother ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go, make yourself pleasing to her ladyship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Mother ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you, my son,&rdquo; she retorted with unusual acerbity, &ldquo;do
  you want a million or do you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Mother ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then go at once and get it, ere that fool Sir Timothy or the odious
  Boatfield capture it under your very nose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Mother ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go! say something smart to her at once ... talk about your gray mare
  ... she is over fond of horses ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as the young Squire, awkward and clumsy in his manner, more accustomed
  to the company of his own servants than to that of highborn ladies, made
  sundry unfortunate attempts to enchain the attention of the heiress, his
  worthy mother turned with meek benignity to Sir Marmaduke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A veritable infatuation, good Sir Marmaduke,&rdquo; she said with
  a sigh, &ldquo;quite against my interests, you know. I had no thought to
  see the dear lad married so soon, nor to give up my home at the Dene yet,
  in favor of a new mistress. Not but that Oliver is not a good son to his
  mother&mdash;such a good lad!&mdash;and such a good husband he would be to
  any girl who ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A strange youth that secretary of yours, Sir Marmaduke,&rdquo; here
  interposed Dame Harrison in her loud, dictatorial voice, breaking in on Mistress
  Pyncheon&rsquo;s dithyrambs, &ldquo;modest he appears to be, and silent too:
  a paragon meseems!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She spoke with obvious sarcasm, casting covert glances at Lady Sue to see
  if she heard.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lambert is very industrious,&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought secretaries never did anything but suck the ends of their
  pens,&rdquo; suggested Mistress Pyncheon mildly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes they make love to their employer&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; retorted
  Dame Harrison spitefully, for Lady Sue was undoubtedly lending an ear to
  the conversation now that it had the young secretary for object. She was
  not watching Squire Boatfield who was wielding the balls just then with remarkable
  prowess, and at this last remark from the portly old dame, she turned sharply
  round and said with a strange little air of haughtiness which somehow became
  her very well:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But then you see, mistress, Master Lambert&rsquo;s employer doth
  not possess a daughter of his own&mdash;only a ward ... mayhap that is the
  reason why his secretary performs his duties so well in other ways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her cheeks were glowing as she said this, and she looked quite defiant,
  as if challenging these disagreeable mothers and aunts of fortune-hunting
  youths to cast unpleasant aspersions on a friend whom she had taken under
  her special protection.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke looked at her keenly; a deep frown settled between his eyes
  at sight of her enthusiasm. His face suddenly looked older, and seemed more
  dour, more repellent than before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sue hath such a romantic temperament,&rdquo; he said dryly, speaking
  between his teeth and as if with an effort. &ldquo;Lambert&rsquo;s humble
  origin has fired her imagination. He has no parents and his elder brother
  is the blacksmith down at Acol; his aunt, who seems to have had charge of
  the boys ever since they were children, is just a common old woman who lives
  in the village&mdash;a strict adherent, so I am told, of this new sect, whom
  Justice Bennet of Derby hath so justly nicknamed &lsquo;Quakers.&rsquo; They
  talk strangely, these people, and believe in a mighty queer fashion. I know
  not if Lambert be of their creed, for he does not use the &lsquo;thee&rsquo; and &lsquo;thou&rsquo; when
  speaking as do all Quakers, so I am told; but his empty pockets, a smattering
  of learning which he has picked up the Lord knows where, and a plethora of
  unspoken grievances, have all proved a sure passport to Lady Sue&rsquo;s
  sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, but your village of Acol seems full of queer folk, good Sir
  Marmaduke,&rdquo; said Mistress Pyncheon. &ldquo;I have heard talk among
  my servants of a mysterious prince hailed from France, who has lately made
  one of your cottages his home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! ah! yes!&rdquo; quoth Sir Marmaduke lightly, &ldquo;the interesting
  exile from the Court of King Louis. I did not know that his fame had reached
  you, mistress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A French prince?&mdash;in this village?&rdquo; exclaimed Dame Harrison
  sharply, &ldquo;and pray, good Sir Marmaduke, where did you go a-fishing
  to get such a bite?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; replied Sir Marmaduke with a short laugh, &ldquo;I had
  naught to do with his coming; he wandered to Acol from Dover about six months
  ago it seems, and found refuge in the Lamberts&rsquo; cottage, where he has
  remained ever since. A queer fellow I believe. I have only seen him once
  or twice in my fields ... in the evening, usually ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Perhaps there was just a curious note of irritability in Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s
  voice as he spoke of this mysterious inhabitant of the quiet village of Acol;
  certain it is that the two matchmaking old dames seemed smitten at one and
  the same time with a sense of grave danger to their schemes.</p>
  <p>An exile from France, a prince who hides his identity and his person in
  a remote Kentish village, and a girl with a highly imaginative temperament
  like Lady Sue! here was surely a more definite, a more important rival to
  the pretensions of homely country youths like Sir Timothy Harrison or Squire
  Pyncheon, than even the student of humble origin whose brother was a blacksmith,
  whose aunt was a Quakeress, and who wandered about the park of Acol with
  hollow eyes fixed longingly on the much-courted heiress.</p>
  <p>Dame Harrison and Mistress Pyncheon both instinctively turned a scrutinizing
  gaze on her ladyship. Neither of them was perhaps ordinarily very observant,
  but self-interest had made them keen, and it would have been impossible not
  to note the strange atmosphere which seemed suddenly to pervade the entire
  personality of the young girl.</p>
  <p>There was nothing in her face now expressive of whole-hearted partisanship
  for an absent friend, such as she had displayed when she felt that young
  Lambert was being unjustly sneered at; rather was it a kind of entranced
  and arrested thought, as if her mind, having come in contact with one all-absorbing
  idea, had ceased to function in any other direction save that one.</p>
  <p>Her cheeks no longer glowed, they seemed pale and transparent like those
  of an ascetic; her lips were slightly parted, her eyes appeared unconscious
  of everything round her, and gazing at something enchanting beyond that bank
  of clouds which glimmered, snow-white, through the trees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what in the name of common sense is a French prince doing in
  Acol village?&rdquo; ejaculated Dame Harrison in her most strident voice,
  which had the effect of drawing every one&rsquo;s attention to herself and
  to Sir Marmaduke, whom she was thus addressing.</p>
  <p>The men ceased playing and gathered nearer. The spell was broken. That strange
  and mysterious look vanished from Lady Sue&rsquo;s face; she turned away
  from the speakers and idly plucked a few bunches of acorn from an overhanging
  oak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of a truth,&rdquo; replied Sir Marmaduke, whose eyes were still steadily
  fixed on his ward, &ldquo;I know as little about the fellow, ma&rsquo;am,
  as you do yourself. He was exiled from France by King Louis for political
  reasons, so he explained to the old woman Lambert, with whom he is still
  lodging. I understand that he hardly ever sleeps at the cottage, that his
  appearances there are short and fitful and that his ways are passing mysterious....
  And that is all I know,&rdquo; he added in conclusion, with a careless shrug
  of the shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite a romance!&rdquo; remarked Mistress Pyncheon dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You should speak to him, good Sir Marmaduke,&rdquo; said Dame Harrison
  decisively, &ldquo;you are a magistrate. &rsquo;Tis your duty to know more
  of this fellow and his antecedents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scarcely that, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Marmaduke, &ldquo;you
  understand ... I have a young ward living for the nonce in my house ... she
  is very rich, and, I fear me, of a very romantic disposition ... I shall
  try to get the man removed from hence, but until that is accomplished, I
  prefer to know nothing about him ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How wise of you, good Sir Marmaduke!&rdquo; quoth Mistress Pyncheon
  with a sigh of content.</p>
  <p>A sentiment obviously echoed in the hearts of a good many people there present.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One knows these foreign adventurers,&rdquo; concluded Sir Marmaduke
  with pleasant irony, &ldquo;with their princely crowns and forlorn causes
  ... half a million of English money would no doubt regild the former and
  bolster up the latter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rose from his seat as he spoke, boldly encountering even as he did so,
  a pair of wrathful and contemptuous girlish eyes fixed steadily upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall we go within?&rdquo; he said, addressing his guests, and returning
  his young ward&rsquo;s gaze haughtily, even commandingly; &ldquo;a cup of
  sack-posset will be welcome after the fatigue of the game. Will you honor
  my poor house, mistress? and you, too, ma&rsquo;am? Gentlemen, you must fight
  among yourselves for the privilege of escorting Lady Sue to the house, and
  if she prove somewhat disdainful this beautiful summer&rsquo;s afternoon,
  I pray you remember that faint heart never won fair lady, and that the citadel
  is not worth storming an it is not obdurate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The suggestion of sack-posset proved vastly to the liking of the merry company.
  Mistress de Chavasse who had been singularly silent all the afternoon, walked
  quickly in advance of her brother-in-law&rsquo;s guests, no doubt in order
  to cast a scrutinizing eye over the arrangements of the table, which she
  had entrusted to the servants.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke followed at a short distance, escorting the older women, making
  somewhat obvious efforts to control his own irritability, and to impart some
  sort of geniality to the proceedings.</p>
  <p>Then in a noisy group in the rear came the three men still fighting for
  the good graces of Lady Sue, whilst she, silent, absorbed, walked leisurely
  along, paying no heed to the wrangling of her courtiers, her fingers tearing
  up with nervous impatience the delicate cups of the acorns, which she then
  threw from her with childish petulance.</p>
  <p>And her eyes still sought the distance beyond the boundaries of Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s
  private grounds, there where cornfields and sky and sea were merged by the
  summer haze into a glowing line of emerald and purple and gold.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  Grinding Poverty</b></h2>
  <p>It was about an hour later. Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s guests had departed, Dame
  Harrison in her rickety coach, Mistress Pyncheon in her chaise, whilst Squire
  Boatfield was riding his well-known ancient cob.</p>
  <p>Everyone had drunk sack-posset, had eaten turkey pasties, and enjoyed the
  luscious fruit: the men had striven to be agreeable to the heiress, the old
  ladies to be encouraging to their prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. Sir Marmaduke had
  tried to be equally amiable to all, whilst favoring none. He was an unpopular
  man in East Kent and he knew it, doing nothing to counterbalance the unpleasing
  impression caused invariably by his surly manner, and his sarcastic, often
  violent, temper.</p>
  <p>Mistress Amelia Editha de Chavasse was now alone with her brother-in-law
  in the great bare hall of the Court, Lady Sue having retired to her room
  under pretext of the vapors, and young Lambert been finally dismissed from
  work for the day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are passing kind to the youth, Marmaduke,&rdquo; said Mistress
  de Chavasse meditatively when the young man&rsquo;s darkly-clad figure had
  disappeared up the stairs.</p>
  <p>She was sitting in a high-backed chair, her head resting against the carved
  woodwork. The folds of her simple gown hung primly round her well-shaped
  figure. Undoubtedly she was still a very good-looking woman, though past
  the hey-day of her youth and beauty. The half-light caused by the depth of
  the window embrasure, and the smallness of the glass panes through which
  the summer sun hardly succeeded in gaining admittance, added a certain softness
  to her chiseled features, and to the usually hard expression of her large
  dark eyes.</p>
  <p>She was gazing out of the tall window, wherein the several broken panes
  were roughly patched with scraps of paper, out into the garden and the distance
  beyond, where the sea could be always guessed at, even when not seen. Sir
  Marmaduke had his back to the light: he was sitting astride a low chair,
  his high-booted foot tapping the ground impatiently, his fingers drumming
  a devil&rsquo;s tattoo against the back of the chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lambert would starve if I did not provide for him,&rdquo; he said
  with a sneer. &ldquo;Adam, his brother, could do naught for him: he is poor
  as a church-mouse, poorer even than I&mdash;but nathless,&rdquo; he added
  with a violent oath, &ldquo;it strikes everyone as madness that I should
  keep a secretary when I scarce can pay the wages of a serving maid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twere better you paid your servants&rsquo; wages, Marmaduke,&rdquo; she
  retorted harshly, &ldquo;they were insolent to me just now. Why do you not
  pay the girl&rsquo;s arrears to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do I not climb up to the moon, my dear Editha, and bring down
  a few stars with me in my descent,&rdquo; he replied with a shrug of his
  broad shoulders. &ldquo;I have come to my last shilling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Earl of Northallerton cannot live for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He hath vowed, I believe, that he would do it, if only to spite me.
  And by the time that he come to die this accursed Commonwealth will have
  abolished all titles and confiscated every estate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Marmaduke,&rdquo; she said, casting a quick, furtive look all
  round her, &ldquo;there may be spies about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I care not,&rdquo; he rejoined roughly, jumping to his feet
  and kicking the chair aside so that it struck with a loud crash against the
  flagged floor. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis but little good a man gets for cleaving
  loyally to the Commonwealth. The sequestrated estates of the Royalists would
  have been distributed among the adherents of republicanism, and not held
  to bolster up a military dictatorship. Bah!&rdquo; he continued, allowing
  his temper to overmaster him, speaking in harsh tones and with many a violent
  oath, &ldquo;it had been wiser to embrace the Royal cause. The Lord Protector
  is sick, so &rsquo;tis said. His son Richard hath no backbone, and the present
  tyranny is worse than the last. I cannot collect my rents; I have been given
  neither reward nor compensation for the help I gave in &rsquo;46. So much
  for their boasted gratitude and their many promises! My Lord Protector feasts
  the Dutch ambassadors with music and with wine, my Lords Ireton and Fairfax
  and Hutchinson and the accursed lot of canting Puritans flaunt it in silks
  and satins, whilst I go about in a ragged doublet and with holes in my shoes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Lady Sue,&rdquo; murmured Mistress de Chavasse soothingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw! the guardianship of a girl who comes of age in three months!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can get another by that time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not I. I am not a sycophant hanging round White Hall! &rsquo;Twas
  sheer good luck and no merit of mine that got me the guardianship of Sue.
  Lord Middlesborough, her kinsman, wanted it; the Courts would have given
  her to him, but old Noll thought him too much of a &lsquo;gentleman,&rsquo; whilst
  I&mdash;an out-at-elbows country squire, was more to my Lord Protector&rsquo;s
  liking. &rsquo;Tis the only thing he ever did for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was intense bitterness and a harsh vein of sarcasm running through
  Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s talk. It was the speech of a disappointed man, who
  had hoped, and striven, and fought once; had raised longing hands towards
  brilliant things and sighed after glory, or riches, or fame, but whose restless
  spirit had since been tamed, crushed under the heavy weight of unsatisfied
  ambition.</p>
  <p>Poverty&mdash;grinding, unceasing, uninteresting poverty, had been Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s
  relentless tormentor ever since he had reached man&rsquo;s estate. His father,
  Sir Jeremy de Chavasse, had been poor before him. The younger son of that
  Earl of Northallerton who cut such a brilliant figure at the Court of Queen
  Elizabeth, Jeremy had married Mistress Spanton of Acol Court, who had brought
  him a few acres of land heavily burdened with mortgage as her dowry. They
  were a simple-minded, unostentatious couple who pinched and scraped and starved
  that their two sons might keep up the appearances of gentlemen at the Court
  of King Charles.</p>
  <p>But both the young men seemed to have inherited from their brilliant grandfather
  luxurious tastes and a love of gambling and of show&mdash;but neither his
  wealth nor yet his personal charm of manner. The eldest, Rowland, however,
  soon disappeared from the arena of life. He married when scarce twenty years
  of age a girl who had been a play-actress. This marriage nearly broke his
  doting mother&rsquo;s heart, and his own, too, for the matter of that, for
  the union was a most unhappy one. Rowland de Chavasse died very soon after,
  unreconciled to his father and mother, who refused to see him or his family,
  even on his deathbed.</p>
  <p>Jeremy de Chavasse&rsquo;s few hopes now centered on his younger son, Marmaduke.
  In order to enable the young man to remain in London, to mix freely and to
  hold his own in that set into which family traditions had originally gained
  him admittance, the fond mother and indulgent father denied themselves the
  very necessities of life.</p>
  <p>Marmaduke took everything that was given him, whilst chafing at the paucity
  of his allowance. Determined to cut a figure at Court, he spent two years
  and most of his mother&rsquo;s dowry in a vain attempt to capture the heart
  of one or the other of the rich heiresses who graced the entourage of Charles
  I.</p>
  <p>But Nature who had given Marmaduke boundless ambition, had failed to bestow
  on him those attributes which would have helped him on towards its satisfaction.
  He was neither sufficiently prepossessing to please an heiress, nor sufficiently
  witty and brilliant to catch the royal eye or the favor of his uncle, the
  present Earl of Northallerton. His efforts in the direction of advantageous
  matrimony had earned for him at Court the nickname of &ldquo;The Sparrowhawk.&rdquo; But
  even these efforts had soon to be relinquished for want of the wherewithal.</p>
  <p>The doting mother no longer could supply him with a sufficiency of money
  to vie with the rich gallants at the Court, and the savings which Sir Jeremy
  had been patiently accumulating with a view to freeing the Acol estates from
  mortgage went instead to rescue young Marmaduke from a debtor&rsquo;s prison.</p>
  <p>Poor Sir Jeremy did not long survive his disappointment. Marmaduke returned
  to Acol Court only to find his mother a broken invalid, and his father dead.</p>
  <p>Since then it had been a perpetual struggle against poverty and debt, a
  bitter revolt against Fate, a burning desire to satisfy ambition which had
  received so serious a check.</p>
  <p>When the great conflict broke out between King and Parliament, he threw
  himself into it, without zest and without conviction, embracing the cause
  of the malcontents with a total lack of enthusiasm, merely out of disappointment&mdash;out
  of hatred for the brilliant Court and circle in which he had once hoped to
  become a prominent figure.</p>
  <p>He fought under Ireton, was commended as a fairly good soldier, though too
  rebellious to be very reliable, too self-willed to be wholly trusted.</p>
  <p>Even in these days of brilliant reputations quickly made, he remained obscure
  and practically unnoticed. Advancement never came his way and whilst younger
  men succeeded in attracting the observant eye of old Noll, he was superseded
  at every turn, passed over&mdash;anon forgotten.</p>
  <p>When my Lord Protector&rsquo;s entourage was formed, the Household organized,
  no one thought of the Sparrowhawk for any post that would have satisfied
  his desires. Once more he cursed his own poverty. Money&mdash;the want of
  it&mdash;he felt was at the root of all his disappointments. A burning desire
  to obtain it at any cost, even that of honor, filled his entire being, his
  mind, his soul, his thoughts, every nerve in his body. Money, and social
  prestige! To be somebody at Court or elsewhere, politically, commercially,&mdash;he
  cared not. To handle money and to command attention!</p>
  <p>He became wary, less reckless, striving to obtain by diplomatic means that
  which he had once hoped to snatch by sheer force of personality. The Court
  of Chancery having instituted itself sole guardian and administrator of the
  revenues and fortunes of minors whose fathers had fought on the Royalist
  side, and were either dead or in exile, and arrogating unto itself the power
  to place such minors under the tutelage of persons whose loyalty to the Commonwealth
  was undoubted, Sir Marmaduke bethought himself of applying for one of these
  official guardianships which were known to be very lucrative and moreover,
  practically sinecures.</p>
  <p>Fate for once favored him; a half-contemptuous desire to do something for
  this out-at-elbows Kentish squire who had certainly been a loyal adherent
  of the Commonwealth, caused my Lord Protector to favor his application. The
  rich daughter of the Marquis of Dover was placed under the guardianship of
  Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse with an allowance of &pound;4,000 a year for her
  maintenance, until she came of age. A handsome fortune and stroke of good
  luck for a wise and prudent man:&mdash;a drop in an ocean of debts, difficulties
  and expensive tastes, in the case of Sir Marmaduke.</p>
  <p>A prolonged visit to London with a view either of gaining a foothold in
  the new Court, or of drawing the attention of the malcontents, of Monk and
  his party, or even of the Royalists, to himself, resulted in further debts,
  in more mortgages, more bitter disappointments.</p>
  <p>The man himself did not please. His personality was unsympathetic; Lady
  Sue&rsquo;s money which he now lavished right and left, bought neither friendship
  nor confidence. He joined all the secret clubs which in defiance of Cromwell&rsquo;s
  rigid laws against betting and gambling, were the resort of all the smart
  gentlemen in the town. Ill-luck at hazard and dice pursued him: he was a
  bad loser, quarrelsome and surly. His ambition had not taught him the salutary
  lesson of how to make friends in order to attain his desires.</p>
  <p>His second return to the ancestral home was scarcely less disastrous than
  the first; a mortgage on his revenues as guardian of Lady Sue Aldmarshe just
  saved him this time from the pursuit of his creditors, and this mortgage
  he had only obtained through false statements as to his ward&rsquo;s age.</p>
  <p>As he told his sister-in-law a moment ago, he was at his last gasp. He had
  perhaps just begun to realize that he would never succeed through the force
  of his own individuality. Therefore, money had become a still more imperative
  necessity to him. He was past forty now. Disappointed ambition and an ever
  rebellious spirit had left severe imprints on his face: his figure was growing
  heavy, his prominent lips, unadorned by a mustache, had an unpleasant downward
  droop, and lately he had even noticed that the hair on the top of his head
  was not so thick as of yore.</p>
  <p>The situation was indeed getting desperate, since Lady Sue would be of age
  in three months, when all revenues for her maintenance would cease.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Methinks her million will go to one of those young jackanapes who
  hang about her,&rdquo; sighed Mistress de Chavasse, with almost as much bitterness
  as Sir Marmaduke had shown.</p>
  <p>Her fortunes were in a sense bound up with those of her brother-in-law.
  He had been most unaccountably kind to her of late, a kindness which his
  many detractors attributed either to an infatuation for his brother&rsquo;s
  widow, or to a desire to further irritate his uncle the Earl of Northallerton,
  who&mdash;a rigid Puritan himself&mdash;hated the play-actress and her connection
  with his own family.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can naught be done, Marmaduke?&rdquo; she asked after a slight pause,
  during which she had watched anxiously the restless figure of her brother-in-law
  as he paced up and down the narrow hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you suggest anything, my dear Editha?&rdquo; he retorted roughly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; she ejaculated with some impatience, &ldquo;you are
  not so old, but you could have made yourself agreeable to the wench.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You think that she would have fallen in love with her middle-aged
  guardian?&rdquo; he exclaimed with a harsh, sarcastic laugh. &ldquo;That
  girl? ... with her head full of romantic nonsense ... and I ... in ragged
  doublet, with a bald head, and an evil temper ... Bah!!! ... But,&rdquo; he
  added, with an unpleasant sneer, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis unselfish and disinterested
  on your part, my dear Editha, even to suggest it. Sue does not like you.
  Her being mistress here would not be conducive to your comfort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! &rsquo;tis no use going on in this manner any longer, Marmaduke,&rdquo; she
  said dejectedly. &ldquo;Pleasant times will not come my way so long as you
  have not a shilling to give me for a new gown, and cannot afford to keep
  up my house in London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She fully expected another retort from him&mdash;brutal and unbridled as
  was his wont when money affairs were being discussed. He was not accustomed
  to curb his violence in her presence. She had been his helpmeet in many unavowable
  extravagances, in the days when he was still striving after a brilliant position
  in town. There had been certain rumors anent a gambling den, whereat Mistress
  de Chavasse had been the presiding spirit and which had come under the watchful
  eye of my Lord Protector&rsquo;s spies.</p>
  <p>Now she had perforce to share her brother-in-law&rsquo;s poverty. At any
  rate he provided a roof over her head. On the advent of Lady Sue Aldmarshe
  into his bachelor establishment he called on his sister-in-law for the part
  of duenna.</p>
  <p>At one time the fair Editha had exercised her undoubted charms over Marmaduke&rsquo;s
  violent nature, but latterly she had become a mere butt for his outbursts
  of rage. But now to her astonishment, and in response to her petulant reproach,
  his fury seemed to fall away from him. He threw his head back and broke out
  into uncontrolled, half-sarcastic, almost defiant laughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How blind you are, my dear Editha,&rdquo; he said with a shrug of
  his broad shoulders. &ldquo;Nay! an I mistake not, in that case there will
  be some strange surprises for you within the next three months. I pray you
  try and curb your impatience until then, and to bear with the insolence of
  a serving wench, &rsquo;Twill serve you well, mine oath on that!&rdquo; he
  added significantly.</p>
  <p>Then without vouchsafing further explanations of his enigmatic utterances,
  he turned on his heel&mdash;still laughing apparently at some pleasing thought&mdash;and
  walked upstairs, leaving her to meditate.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  The Legal Aspect</b></h2>
  <p>Mistress de Chavasse sat musing, in that high-backed chair, for some considerable
  time. Anon Sir Marmaduke once more traversed the hall, taking no heed of
  her as he went out into the garden. She watched his broad figure moving along
  the path and then crossing the rustic bridge until it disappeared among the
  trees of the park.</p>
  <p>There was something about his attitude of awhile ago which puzzled her.
  And with puzzlement came an inexplicable fear: she had known Marmaduke in
  all his moods, but never in such an one as he had displayed before her just
  now. There had been a note almost of triumph in the laughter with which he
  had greeted her last reproach. The cry of the sparrowhawk when it seizes
  its prey.</p>
  <p>Triumph in Sir Marmaduke filled her with dread. No one knew better than
  she did the hopeless condition of his financial status. Debt&mdash;prison
  perhaps&mdash;was waiting for him at every turn. Yet he seemed triumphant!
  She knew him to have reached those confines of irritability and rebellion
  against poverty which would cause him to shrink from nothing for the sake
  of gaining money. Yet he seemed triumphant!</p>
  <p>Instinctively she shuddered as she thought of Sue. She had no cause to like
  the girl, yet would she not wish to see her come to harm.</p>
  <p>She did not dare avow even to herself the conviction which she had, that
  if Sir Marmaduke could gain anything by the young girl&rsquo;s death, he
  would not hesitate to ... Nay! she would not even frame that thought. Marmaduke
  had been kind to her; she could but hope that temptation such as that, would
  never come his way.</p>
  <p>Hymn-of-Praise Busy broke in on her meditations. His nasal tones&mdash;which
  had a singular knack of irritating her as a rule&mdash;struck quite pleasingly
  on her ear, as a welcome interruption to the conflict of her thoughts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Master Skyffington, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said in his usual drawly
  voice, &ldquo;he is on his way to Dover, and desired his respects, an you
  wish to see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! yes! I&rsquo;ll see Master Skyffington,&rdquo; she said with
  alacrity, rising from her chair, &ldquo;go apprise Sir Marmaduke, and ask
  Master Skyffington to come within.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was all agitation now, eager, excited, and herself went forward to meet
  the quaint, little wizened figure which appeared in the doorway.</p>
  <p>Master Skyffington, attorney-at-law, was small and thin&mdash;looked doubly
  so, in fact, in the black clothes which he wore. His eyes were blue and watery,
  his manner peculiarly diffident. He seemed to present a perpetual apology
  to the world for his own existence therein.</p>
  <p>Even now as Mistress de Chavasse seemed really overjoyed to see him, he
  backed his meager person out of the doorway as she approached, whereupon
  she&mdash;impatiently&mdash;clutched his arm and dragged him forward into
  the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit down there, master,&rdquo; she said, speaking with obvious agitation,
  and almost pushing the poor little man off his feet whilst dragging him to
  a chair. &ldquo;Sir Marmaduke will see you anon, but &rsquo;twas a kind thought
  to come and bring me news.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hem! ... hem! ...&rdquo; stammered Master Skyffington, &ldquo;I ...
  that is ... hem ... I left Canterbury this morning and was on my way to Dover
  ... hem ... this lies on my way, ma&rsquo;am ... and ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; she said impatiently, &ldquo;but you have some news,
  of course?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;News! ... news!&rdquo; he muttered apologetically, and clutching
  at his collar, which seemed to be choking him, &ldquo;what news&mdash;er&mdash;I
  pray you, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That clew?&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was very slight,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it led to naught?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her eagerness vanished. She sank back into her chair and moaned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My last hope!&rdquo; she said dully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! nay!&rdquo; rejoined Master Skyffington quite cheerfully, his
  courage seemingly having risen with her despair. &ldquo;We must not be despondent.
  The noble Earl of Northallerton hath interested himself of late in the search
  and ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she shrugged her shoulders, whilst a short, bitter laugh escaped her
  lips:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At last?&rdquo; she said with biting sarcasm. &ldquo;After twelve
  years!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! but remember, ma&rsquo;am, that his lordship now is very ill
  ... and nigh on seventy years old.... Failing your late husband, Master Rowland&mdash;whom
  the Lord hath in His keeping&mdash;your eldest son is ... hem ... that is
  ... by law, ma&rsquo;am, ... and with all respect due to Sir Marmaduke ...
  your eldest son is heir to the Earldom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And though his lordship hates me, he still prefers that my son should
  succeed to his title, rather than Sir Marmaduke whom he abhors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But that suggestion was altogether too much for poor Master Skyffington&rsquo;s
  sense of what was due to so noble a family, and to its exalted head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is ... er ...&rdquo; he muttered in supreme discomfort, swallowing
  great gulps which rose to his throat at this rash and disrespectful speech
  from the ex-actress. &ldquo;Family feuds ... hem ... er ... very distressing
  of a truth ... and ... that is ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I fear me his lordship will be disappointed,&rdquo; she rejoined,
  quite heedless of the little attorney&rsquo;s perturbation, &ldquo;and that
  under these circumstances Sir Marmaduke will surely succeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was about to remark,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;that now, with
  my lord&rsquo;s help&mdash;his wealth and influence ... now, that is, ...
  that he has interested himself in the matter ... hem ... we might make fresh
  inquiries ... that is ... er ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will be useless, master. I have done all that is humanly possible.
  I loved my boys dearly&mdash;and it was because of my love for them that
  I placed them under my mother&rsquo;s care.... I loved them, you understand,
  but I was living in a gay world in London ... my husband was dead ... I could
  do naught for their comfort.... I thought it would be best for them ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was her turn now to speak humbly, almost apologetically, whilst her eyes
  sought those of the simple little attorney, trying to read approval in his
  glance, or at any rate an absence of reproof. He was shaking his head, sighing
  with visible embarrassment the while. In his innermost soul, he could find
  no excuse for the frivolous mother, anxious to avoid the responsibilities
  which the Lord Himself had put upon her: anxious to be rid of her children
  in order that she might pursue with greater freedom and ease that life of
  enjoyment and thoughtlessness which she craved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My mother was a strange woman,&rdquo; continued Mistress de Chavasse
  earnestly and placing her small white hand on the black sleeve of the attorney, &ldquo;she
  cared little enough for me, and not at all for London and for society. She
  did not understand the many duties that devolve on a woman of fashion....
  And I was that in those days! ... twenty years ago!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! Truly! truly!&rdquo; sighed Master Skyffington.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayhap she acted according to her own lights.... After some years
  she became a convert to that strange new faith ... of the people who call
  themselves &lsquo;Friends&rsquo; ... who salute no one with the hat, and
  who talk so strangely, saying: &lsquo;thee&rsquo; and &lsquo;thou&rsquo; even
  when addressing their betters. One George Fox had a great hold on her. He
  was quite a youth then, but she thought him a saint. &rsquo;Tis he, methinks,
  poisoned her mind against me, and caused her to curse me on her deathbed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She gave a little shudder&mdash;of superstition, perhaps. The maternal curse&mdash;she
  felt&mdash;was mayhap bearing fruit after all. Master Skyffington&rsquo;s
  watery eyes expressed gentle sympathy. His calling had taught him many of
  the hidden secrets of human nature and of Life: he guessed that the time&mdash;if
  not already here&mdash;was nigh at hand, when this unfortunate woman would
  realize the emptiness of her life, and would begin to reap the bitter harvest
  of the barren seeds which she had sown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! I lay it all at the door of these &lsquo;Friends&rsquo; who
  turned a mother&rsquo;s heart against her own daughter,&rdquo; continued
  Mistress de Chavasse vehemently. &ldquo;She never told me that she was sick,
  sent me neither letter nor message; only after her death a curt note came
  to me, writ in her hand, entrusted to one of her own co-worshipers, a canting,
  mouthing creature, who grinned whilst I read the heartless message. My mother
  had sent her grandchildren away, so she told me in the letter, when she felt
  that the Lord was calling her to Him. She had placed my boys&mdash;my boys,
  master!&mdash;in the care of a trusted &lsquo;friend&rsquo; who would bring
  them up in the fear of God, away from the influence of their mother. My boys,
  master, remember! ... they were to be brought up in ignorance of their name&mdash;of
  the very existence of their mother. The &lsquo;friend,&rsquo; doubtless a
  fellow Quaker&mdash;had agreed to this on my mother&rsquo;s deathbed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hm! &rsquo;tis passing strange, and passing sad,&rdquo; said the
  attorney, with real sympathy now, for there was a pathetic note of acute
  sorrow in Mistress de Chavasse&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;but at the time ...
  hem ... and with money and influence ... hem ... much might have been done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! believe me, master, I did what I could. I was in London then....
  I flew to Canterbury where my mother lived.... I found her dead ... and the
  boys gone ... none of the neighbors could tell me whither.... All they knew
  was that a woman had been living with my mother of late and had gone away,
  taking the boys with her.... My boys, master, and no one could tell me whither
  they had gone! I spent what money I had, and Sir Marmaduke nobly bore his
  share in the cost of a ceaseless search, as the Earl of Northallerton would
  do nothing then to help me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Passing strange ... passing sad,&rdquo; murmured Master Skyffington,
  shaking his head, &ldquo;but methinks I recollect ... hem ... some six years
  ago ... a quest which led to a clew ... er ... that is ... two young gentlemen
  ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impostors, master,&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;aye! I have heard
  of many such since then. At first I used to believe their stories ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At first?&rdquo; he ejaculated in amazement, &ldquo;but surely ...
  hem ... the faces ... your own sons, ma&rsquo;am ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! the faces!&rdquo; she said, whilst a blush of embarrassment,
  even of shame, now suffused her pale cheeks. &ldquo;I mean ... you understand
  ... I ... I had not seen my boys since they were babes in arms ... they were
  ten years old when they were taken away ... but ... but it is nigh on twenty-two
  years since I have set eyes on their faces. I would not know them, if they
  passed me by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tears choked her voice. Shame had added its bitter sting to the agony of
  her sorrow. Of a truth it was a terrible epilogue of misery, following on
  a life-story of frivolity and of heartlessness which Mistress de Chavasse
  had almost unconsciously related to the poor ignorant country attorney. Desirous
  at all costs of retaining her freedom, she had parted from her children with
  a light heart, glad enough that their grandmother was willing to relieve
  her of all responsibility. Time slipped by whilst she enjoyed herself, danced
  and flirted, gambled and played her part in that world of sport and Fashion
  wherein a mother&rsquo;s heart was an unnecessary commodity. Ten years are
  a long while in the life of an old woman who lives in a remote country town,
  and sees Death approaching with slow yet certain stride; but that same decade
  is but as a fleeting hour to the woman who is young and who lives for the
  moment.</p>
  <p>The boys had been forgotten long ere they disappeared! Forgotten? perhaps
  not!&mdash;but their memory put away in a hidden cell of the mind where other
  inconvenient thoughts were stored: only to be released and gazed upon when
  other more agreeable ones had ceased to fill the brain.</p>
  <p>She felt humbled before this simple-minded man, whom she knew she had shocked
  by the recital of her callousness. With innate gentleness of disposition
  he tried to hide his feelings and to set aside the subject for the moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir Marmaduke was very disinterested, when he aided you in the quest,&rdquo; he
  said meekly, glad to be able to praise one whom he felt it his duty to respect, &ldquo;for
  under present circumstances ... hem! ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will raise no difficulties in Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s way,&rdquo; she
  rejoined, &ldquo;there is no doubt in my mind that my boys are dead, else
  I had had news of them ere this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked at her keenly&mdash;as keenly as he dared with his mild, blue
  eyes. It was hard to keep in sympathy with her. Her moods seemed to change
  as she spoke of her boys and then of Sir Marmaduke. Her last remark seemed
  to argue that her callousness with regard to her sons had not entirely yielded
  to softer emotions yet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In case of my Lord Northallerton&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; she continued
  lightly, &ldquo;I shall not put in a claim on behalf of any son of mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whereupon&mdash;hem Sir Marmaduke as next-of-kin, would have the
  enjoyment of the revenues&mdash;and mayhap would have influence enough then
  to make good his claim to the title before the House of Lords ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He checked himself: looked furtively round and added:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Provided it please God and my Lord Protector that the House of Lords
  come back to Westminster by that time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, master,&rdquo; said Mistress de Chavasse, rising from
  her chair, intimating that this interview was now over, &ldquo;you have told
  me all that I wish to know. Let me assure you, that I will not prove ungrateful.
  Your services will be amply repaid by whomever succeeds to the title and
  revenues of Northallerton. Did you wish to see Sir Marmaduke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, mistress, not to-day,&rdquo; replied Master Skyffington
  somewhat dryly. The lady&rsquo;s promises had not roused his enthusiasm.
  He would have preferred to see more definite reward for his labors, for he
  had worked faithfully and was substantially out of pocket in this quest after
  the two missing young men.</p>
  <p>But he was imbued with that deep respect for the family he had served all
  his life, which no conflict between privilege and people would ever eradicate,
  and though Mistress de Chavasse&rsquo;s origin was of the humblest, she was
  nevertheless herself now within the magic circle into which Master Skyffington
  never gazed save with the deepest reverence.</p>
  <p>He thought it quite natural that she should dismiss him with a curt and
  condescending nod, and when she had swept majestically out of the room, he
  made his way humbly across the hall, then by the garden door out towards
  the tumble-down barn where he had tethered his old mare.</p>
  <p>Master Courage helped him to mount, and he rode away in the direction of
  the Dover Road, his head bent, his thoughts dwelling in puzzlement and wonder
  on the strange doings of those whom he still reverently called his betters.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  Under The Shadow Of The Elms</b></h2>
  <p>Her head full of romantic nonsense! Well! perhaps that was the true keynote
  of Sue&rsquo;s character; perhaps, too, it was that same romantic temperament
  which gave such peculiar charm to her personality. It was not mere beauty&mdash;of
  which she had a plentiful share&mdash;nor yet altogether her wealth which
  attracted so many courtiers to her feet. Men who knew her in those days at
  Acol and subsequently at Court said that Lady Sue was magnetic.</p>
  <p>She compelled attention, she commanded admiration, through that very romanticism
  of hers which caused her eyes to glow at the recital of valor, or sorrow,
  or talent, which caused her to see beauty of thought and mind and character
  there where it lay most deeply hidden, there&mdash;sometimes&mdash;where
  it scarce existed.</p>
  <p>The dark figure of her guardian&rsquo;s secretary had attracted her attention
  from the moment when she first saw him moving silently about the house and
  park: the first words she spoke to him were words of sympathy. His life-story&mdash;brief
  and simple as it had been&mdash;had interested her. He seemed so different
  from these young and old country squires who frequented Acol Court. He neither
  wooed nor flattered her, yet seemed to find great joy in her company. His
  voice at times was harsh, his manner abrupt and even rebellious, but at others
  it fell to infinite gentleness when he talked to her of Nature and the stars,
  both of which he had studied deeply.</p>
  <p>He never spoke of religion. That subject which was on everybody&rsquo;s
  tongue, together with the free use of the most sacred names, he rigorously
  avoided, also politics, and my Lord Protector&rsquo;s government, his dictatorship
  and ever-growing tyranny: but he knew the name of every flower that grew
  in meadow or woodland, the note of every bird as it trilled its song.</p>
  <p>There is no doubt that but for the advent of that mysterious personality
  into Acol village, the deep friendship which had grown in Sue&rsquo;s heart
  for Richard Lambert would have warmed into a more passionate attachment.</p>
  <p>But she was too young to reflect, too impulsive to analyze her feelings.
  The mystery which surrounded the foreigner who lodged at the Quakeress&rsquo;s
  cottage had made strong appeal to her idealism.</p>
  <p>His first introduction to her notice, in the woods beyond the park gate
  on that cold January evening, with the moon gleaming weirdly through the
  branches of the elms, his solitary figure leaning against a tree, had fired
  her imagination and set it wildly galloping after mad fantasies.</p>
  <p>He had scarcely spoken on that first occasion, but his silence was strangely
  impressive. She made up her mind that he was singularly handsome, although
  she could not judge of that very clearly for he wore a heavy mustache, and
  a shade over one eye; but he was tall, above the average, and carried the
  elaborate habiliments which the Cavaliers still affected, with consummate
  grace and ease. She thought, too, that the thick perruque became him very
  well, and his muffled voice, when he spoke, sounded singularly sweet.</p>
  <p>Since then she had seen him constantly. At rare intervals at first, for
  maidenly dignity forbade that she should seem eager to meet him. He was ignorant
  of whom she was&mdash;oh! of that she felt quite quite sure: she always wore
  a dark tippet round her shoulders, and a hood to cover her head. He seemed
  pleased to see her, just to hear her voice. Obviously he was lonely and in
  deep trouble.</p>
  <p>Then one night&mdash;it was the first balmy evening after the winter frosts&mdash;the
  moon was singularly bright, and the hood had fallen back from her head, just
  as her face was tilted upwards and her eyes glowing with enthusiasm. Then
  she knew that he had learnt to love her, not through any words which he spoke,
  for he was silent; his face was in shadow, and he did not even touch her;
  therefore it was not through any of her natural senses that she guessed his
  love. Yet she knew it, and her young heart was overfilled with happiness.</p>
  <p>That evening when they parted he knelt at her feet and kissed the hem of
  her kirtle. After which, when she was back again in her own little room at
  Acol Court, she cried for very joy.</p>
  <p>They did not meet very often. Once a week at most. He had vaguely promised
  to tell her, some day, of his great work for the regeneration of France,
  which he was carrying out in loneliness and exile here in England, a work
  far greater and more comprehensive than that which had secured for England
  religious and political liberty; this work it was which made him a wanderer
  on the face of the earth and caused his frequent and lengthy absences from
  the cottage in which he lodged.</p>
  <p>She was quite content for the moment with these vague promises: in her heart
  she was evolving enchanting plans for the future, when she would be his helpmate
  in this great and mysterious work.</p>
  <p>In the meanwhile she was satisfied to live in the present, to console and
  comfort the noble exile, to lavish on him the treasures of her young and
  innocent love, to endow him in her imagination with all those mental and
  physical attributes which her romantic nature admired most.</p>
  <p>The spring had come, clothing the weird branches of the elms with a tender
  garb of green, the anemones in the woods yielded to the bluebells and these
  to carpets of primroses and violets. The forests of Thanet echoed with songs
  of linnets and white-throats. She was happy and she was in love.</p>
  <p>With the lengthened days came some petty sorrows. He was obviously worried,
  sometimes even impatient. Their meetings became fewer and shorter, for the
  evening hours were brief. She found it difficult to wander out so late across
  the park, unperceived, and he would never meet her by day-light.</p>
  <p>This no doubt had caused him to fret. He loved her and desired her all his
  own. Yet &rsquo;twere useless of a surety to ask Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s consent
  to her marriage with her French prince. He would never give it, and until
  she came of age he had absolute power over her choice of a husband.</p>
  <p>She had explained this to him and he had sighed and murmured angry words,
  then pressed her with increased passion to his heart.</p>
  <p>To-night as she walked through the park, she was conscious&mdash;for the
  first time perhaps&mdash;of a certain alloy mixed with her gladness. Yet
  she loved him&mdash;oh, yes! just, just as much as ever. The halo of romance
  with which she had framed in his mystic personality was in no way dimmed,
  but in a sense she almost feared him, for at times his muffled voice sounded
  singularly vehement, and his words betrayed the uncontrolled violence of
  his nature.</p>
  <p>She had hoped to bring him some reassuring news anent Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse&rsquo;s
  intentions with regard to herself, but the conversation round the skittle-alley,
  her guardian&rsquo;s cruel allusions to &ldquo;the foreign adventurer,&rdquo; had
  shown her how futile were such hopes.</p>
  <p>Yet, there were only three months longer of this weary waiting. Surely he
  could curb his impatience until she was of age and mistress of her own hand!
  Surely he trusted her!</p>
  <p>She sighed as this thought crossed her mind, and nearly fell up against
  a dark figure which detached itself from among the trees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Master Lambert!&rdquo; she said, uttering a little cry of surprise,
  pressing her hand against her heart which was palpitating with emotion. &ldquo;I
  had no thought of meeting you here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I still less of seeing your ladyship,&rdquo; he rejoined coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How cross you are,&rdquo; she retorted with childish petulance, &ldquo;what
  have I done that you should be so unkind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unkind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! I had meant to speak to you of this ere now&mdash;but you always
  avoid me ... you scarce will look at me ... and ... and I wished to ask you
  if I had offended you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They were standing on a soft carpet of moss, overhead the gentle summer
  breeze stirred the great branches of the elms, causing the crisp leaves to
  mutter a long-drawn hush-sh-sh in the stillness of the night. From far away
  came the appealing call of a blackbird chased by some marauding owl, while
  on the ground close by, the creaking of tiny branches betrayed the quick
  scurrying of a squirrel. From the remote and infinite distance came the subdued
  roar of the sea.</p>
  <p>The peace of the woodland, the sighing of the trees, the dark evening sky
  above, filled his heart with an aching longing for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Offended me?&rdquo; he murmured, passing his hand across his forehead,
  for his temples throbbed and his eyes were burning. &ldquo;Nay! why should
  you think so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are so cold, so distant now,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;We
  were such good friends when first I came here. Thanet is a strange country
  to me. It seems weird and unkind&mdash;the woods are dark and lonely, that
  persistent sound of the sea fills me with a strange kind of dread.... My
  home was among the Surrey hills you know.... It is far from here.... I cannot
  afford to lose a friend....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She sighed, a quaint, wistful little sigh, curiously out of place, he thought,
  in this exquisite mouth framed only for smiles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have so few real friends,&rdquo; she added in a whisper, so low
  that he thought she had not spoken, and that the elms had sighed that pathetic
  phrase into his ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Believe me, Lady Sue, I am neither cold nor distant,&rdquo; he said,
  almost smiling now, for the situation appeared strange indeed, that this
  beautiful young girl, rich, courted, surrounded by an army of sycophants,
  should be appealing to a poor dependent for friendship. &ldquo;I am only
  a little dazed ... as any man would be who had been dreaming ... and saw
  that dream vanish away....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dreaming?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&mdash;we all dream sometimes you know ... and a penniless man
  like myself, without prospects or friends is, methinks, more prone to it
  than most.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We all have dreams sometimes,&rdquo; she said, speaking very low,
  whilst her eyes sought to pierce the darkness beyond the trees. &ldquo;I
  too ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused abruptly, and was quite still for a moment, almost holding her
  breath, he thought, as if she were listening. But not a sound came to disturb
  the silence of the woods. Blackbird and owl had ceased their fight for life,
  the squirrel had gone to rest: the evening air was filled only by the great
  murmur of the distant sea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me your dream,&rdquo; she said abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas! it is too foolish! ... too mad! ... too impossible....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you said once that you would be my friend and would try to cheer
  my loneliness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I will, with all my heart, an you will permit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet is there no friendship without confidence,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;Tell
  me your dream.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What were the use? You would only laugh ... and justly too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should never laugh at that which made you sad,&rdquo; she said
  gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sad?&rdquo; he rejoined with a short laugh, which had something of
  his usual bitterness in it. &ldquo;Sad? Mayhap! Yet I hardly know. Think
  you that the poor peasant lad would be sad because he had dreamed that the
  fairy princess whom he had seen from afar in her radiance, was sweet and
  gracious to him one midsummer&rsquo;s day? It was only a dream, remember:
  when he woke she had vanished ... gone out of his sight ... hidden from him
  by a barrier of gold.... In front of this barrier stood his pride ... which
  perforce would have to be trampled down and crushed ere he could reach the
  princess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She did not reply, only bent her sweet head, lest he should perceive the
  tears which had gathered in her eyes. All round them the wood seemed to have
  grown darker and more dense, whilst from afar the weird voice of that distant
  sea murmured of infinity and of the relentlessness of Fate.</p>
  <p>They could not see one another very clearly, yet she knew that he was gazing
  at her with an intensity of love and longing in his heart which caused her
  own to ache with sympathy; and he knew that she was crying, that there was
  something in that seemingly brilliant and happy young life, which caused
  the exquisite head to droop as if under a load of sorrow.</p>
  <p>A broken sigh escaped her lips, or was it the sighing of the wind in the
  elms?</p>
  <p>He was smitten with remorse to think that he should have helped to make
  her cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sue&mdash;my little, beautiful Sue,&rdquo; he murmured, himself astonished
  at his own temerity in thus daring to address her. It was her grief which
  had brought her down to his level: the instinct of chivalry, of protection,
  of friendship which had raised him up to hers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you ever forgive me?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I had no right to
  speak to you as I have done.... And yet ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused and she repeated his last two words&mdash;gently, encouragingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And yet ... good master?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet at times, when I see the crowd of young, empty-headed fortune-seeking
  jackanapes, who dare to aspire to your ladyship&rsquo;s hand ... I have asked
  myself whether perchance I had the right to remain silent, whilst they poured
  their farrago of nonsense into your ear. I love you, Sue!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! good master!&rdquo; she ejaculated hurriedly, while a nameless,
  inexplicable fear seemed suddenly to be holding her in its grip, as he uttered
  those few very simple words which told the old, old tale.</p>
  <p>But those words once uttered, Richard felt that he could not now draw back.
  The jealously-guarded secret had escaped his lips, passion refused to be
  held longer in check. A torrent of emotion overmastered him. He forgot where
  he was, the darkness of the night, the lateness of the hour, the melancholy
  murmur of the wind in the trees, he forgot that she was rich and he a poor
  dependent, he only remembered that she was exquisitely fair and that he&mdash;poor
  fool!&mdash;was mad enough to worship her.</p>
  <p>It was very dark now, for a bank of clouds hid the glory of the evening
  sky, and he could see only the mere outline of the woman whom he so passionately
  loved, the small head with the fluttering curls fanned by the wind, the graceful
  shoulders and arms folded primly across her bosom.</p>
  <p>He put out his hand and found hers. Oh! the delight of raising it to his
  lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the heaven above us, Sue, by all my hopes of salvation I swear
  to you that my love is pure and selfless,&rdquo; he murmured tenderly, all
  the while that her fragrant little hand was pressed against his lips. &ldquo;But
  for your fortune, I had come to you long ago and said to you &lsquo;Let me
  work for you!&mdash;My love will help me to carve a fortune for you, which
  it shall be my pride to place at your feet.&rsquo;&mdash;Every nameless child,
  so &rsquo;tis said, may be a king&rsquo;s son ... and I, who have no name
  that I can of verity call mine own&mdash;no father&mdash;no kith or kindred&mdash;I
  would conquer a kingdom, Sue, if you but loved me too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His voice broke in a sob. Ashamed of his outburst he tried to hide his confusion
  from her, by sinking on one knee on that soft carpet of moss. From the little
  village of Acol beyond the wood, came the sound of the church bell striking
  the hour of nine. Sue was silent and absorbed, intensely sorrowful to see
  the grief of her friend. He was quite lost in the shadows at her feet now,
  but she could hear the stern efforts which he made to resume control over
  himself and his voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Richard ... good Richard,&rdquo; she said soothingly, &ldquo;believe
  me, I am very, very sorry for this.... I ... I vow I did not know.... I had
  no thought&mdash;how could I have? that you cared for me like ... like this....
  You believe me, good master, do you not?&rdquo; she entreated. &ldquo;Say
  that you believe me, when I say that I would not willingly have caused you
  such grief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe that you are the most sweet and pure woman in all the world,&rdquo; he
  murmured fervently, &ldquo;and that you are as far beyond my reach as are
  the stars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, good master, you must not talk like that.... Truly, truly
  I am only a weak and foolish girl, and quite unworthy of your deep devotion
  ... and you must try ... indeed, indeed you must ... to forget what happened
  under these trees to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of that I pray you have no fear,&rdquo; he replied more calmly, as
  he rose and once more stood before her&mdash;a dark figure in the midst of
  the dark wood&mdash;immovable, almost impassive, with head bent and arms
  folded across his chest. &ldquo;Nathless &rsquo;tis foolish for a nameless
  peasant even to talk of his honor, yet &rsquo;tis mine honor, Lady Sue, which
  will ever help me to remember that a mountain of gold and vast estates stand
  between me and the realization of my dream.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she rejoined earnestly, &ldquo;it is not that only.
  You are my friend, good Richard, and I do not wish to see you eating out
  your heart in vain and foolish regrets. What you ... what you wish could
  never&mdash;never be. Good master, if you were rich to-morrow and I penniless,
  I could never be your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean that you could never love me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>She was silent. A fierce wave of jealousy&mdash;mad, insane, elemental jealousy
  seemed suddenly to sweep over him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You love someone else?&rdquo; he demanded brusquely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What right have you to ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The right of a man who would gladly die to see you happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He spoke harshly, almost brutally. Jealousy had killed all humility in him.
  Love&mdash;proud, passionate and defiant&mdash;stood up for its just claims,
  for its existence, its right to dominate, its desire to conquer.</p>
  <p>But even as he thus stood before her, almost frightening her now by the
  violence of his speech, by the latent passion in him, which no longer would
  bear to be held in check, the bank of clouds which up to now had obscured
  the brilliance of the summer sky, finally swept away eastwards, revealing
  the luminous firmament and the pale crescent moon which now glimmered coldly
  through the branches of the trees.</p>
  <p>A muffled sound as of someone treading cautiously the thick bed of moss,
  and the creaking of tiny twigs caused Richard Lambert to look up momentarily
  from the form of the girl whom he so dearly loved, and to peer beyond her
  into the weirdly illumined density of the wood.</p>
  <p>Not twenty yards from where they were, a low wall divided the park itself
  from the wood beyond, which extended down to Acol village. At an angle of
  the wall there was an iron gate, also the tumble-down pavilion, ivy-grown
  and desolate, with stone steps leading up to it, through the cracks of which
  weeds and moss sprouted up apace.</p>
  <p>A man had just emerged from out the thicket and was standing now to the
  farther side of the gate looking straight at Lambert and at Sue, who stood
  in the full light of the moon. A broad-brimmed hat, such as cavaliers affected,
  cast a dark shadow over his face.</p>
  <p>It was a mere outline only vaguely defined against the background of trees,
  but in that outline Lambert had already recognized the mysterious stranger
  who lodged in his brother&rsquo;s cottage down in Acol.</p>
  <p>The fixed intensity of the young man&rsquo;s gaze caused Sue to turn and
  to look in the same direction. She saw the stranger, who encountering two
  pairs of eyes fixed on him, raised his hat with a graceful flourish of the
  arm: then, with a short ironical laugh, went his way, and was once more lost
  in the gloom.</p>
  <p>The girl instinctively made a movement as if to follow him, whilst a quickly
  smothered cry&mdash;half of joy and half of fear&mdash;escaped her lips.
  She checked the movement as well as the cry, but not before Richard Lambert
  had perceived both.</p>
  <p>With the perception came the awful, overwhelming certitude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That adventurer!&rdquo; he exclaimed involuntarily. &ldquo;Oh my
  God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she looked him full in the face, and threw back her head with a gesture
  of pride and of wrath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Master Lambert,&rdquo; she said haughtily, &ldquo;methinks &rsquo;twere
  needless to remind you that&mdash;since I inadvertently revealed my most
  cherished secret to you&mdash;it were unworthy a man of honor to betray it
  to any one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lady ... Sue,&rdquo; he said, feeling half-dazed, bruised and
  crushed by the terrible moral blow, which he had just received, &ldquo;I
  ... I do not quite understand. Will you deign to explain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is naught to explain,&rdquo; she retorted coldly. &ldquo;Prince
  Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans loves me and I have plighted
  my troth to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! I entreat your ladyship,&rdquo; he said, feeling&mdash;knowing
  the while, how useless it was to make an appeal against the infatuation of
  a hot-headed and impulsive girl, yet speaking with the courage which ofttimes
  is born of despair, &ldquo;I beg of you, on my knees to listen. This foreign
  adventurer ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; she retorted proudly, and drawing back from him,
  for of a truth he had sunk on his knees before her, &ldquo;an you desire
  to be my friend, you must not breathe one word of slander against the man
  I love. ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as he said nothing, realizing, indeed, how futile would be any effort
  or word from him, she said, with growing enthusiasm, whilst her glowing eyes
  fixed themselves upon the gloom which had enveloped the mysterious apparition
  of her lover:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans is the grandest,
  most selfless patriot this world hath ever known. For the sake of France,
  of tyrannized, oppressed France, which he adores, he has sacrificed everything!
  his position, his home, his wealth and vast estates: he is own kinsman to
  King Louis, yet he is exiled from his country whilst a price is set upon
  his head, because he cannot be mute whilst he sees tyranny and oppression
  grind down the people of France. He could return to Paris to-day a rich and
  free man, a prince among his kindred,&mdash;if he would but sacrifice that
  for which he fights so bravely: the liberty of France!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sue! my adored lady,&rdquo; he entreated, &ldquo;in the name of Heaven
  listen to me.... You do believe, do you not, that I am your friend? ... I
  would give my life for you.... I swear to you that you have been deceived
  and tricked by this adventurer, who, preying upon your romantic imagination
  ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, master, an you value my friendship!&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;I
  will not listen to another word. Nay! you should be thankful that I deal
  not more harshly with you&mdash;that I make allowances for your miserable
  jealousy.... Oh! why did you make me say that,&rdquo; she added with one
  of those swift changes of mood, which were so characteristic of her, and
  with sudden contrition, for an involuntary moan had escaped his lips. &ldquo;In
  the name of Heaven, go&mdash;go now I entreat ... leave me to myself ...
  lest anger betray me into saying cruel things ... I am safe&mdash;quite safe
  ... I entreat you to let me return to the house alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice sounded more and more broken as she spoke: sobs were evidently
  rising in her throat. He pulled himself together, feeling that it were unmanly
  to worry her now, when emotion was so obviously overmastering her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgive me, sweet lady,&rdquo; he said quite gently, as he rose from
  his knees. &ldquo;I said more than I had any right to say. I entreat you
  to forgive the poor, presuming peasant who hath dared to raise his eyes to
  the fairy princess of his dreams. I pray you to try and forget all that hath
  happened to-night beneath the shadows of these elms&mdash;and only to remember
  one thing: that my life&mdash;my lonely, humble, unimportant life&mdash;is
  yours ... to serve or help you, to worship or comfort you if need be ...
  and that there could be no greater happiness for me than to give it for your
  sweet sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He bowed very low, until his hand could reach the hem of her kirtle, which
  he then raised to his lips. She was infinitely sorry for him; all her anger
  against him had vanished.</p>
  <p>He was very reluctant to go, for this portion of the park was some distance
  from the house. But she had commanded and he quite understood that she wished
  to be alone: love such as that which he felt for his sweet lady is ever watchful,
  yet ever discreet. Was it not natural that she did not care to look on him
  after he had angered her so?</p>
  <p>She seemed impatient too, and although her feelings towards him had softened,
  she repeated somewhat nervously: &ldquo;I pray you go! Good master, I would
  be alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert hesitated a while longer, he looked all round him as if suspicious
  of any marauders that might be lurking about. The hour was not very late,
  and had she not commanded him to go?</p>
  <p>Nor would he seem to pry on her movements. Having once made up his mind
  to obey, he did so without reserve. Having kissed the hem of her kirtle he
  turned towards the house.</p>
  <p>He meant to keep on the tiny footpath, which she would be bound to traverse
  after him, when she returned. He felt sure that something would warn him
  if she really needed his help.</p>
  <p>The park and woodland were still: only the mournful hooting of an owl, the
  sad sighing of the wind in the old elms broke the peaceful silence of this
  summer&rsquo;s night.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  The Stranger Within The Gates</b></h2>
  <p>Sue waited&mdash;expectant and still&mdash;until the last sound of the young
  man&rsquo;s footsteps had died away in the direction of the house.</p>
  <p>Then with quick impulsive movements she ran to the gate; her hands sought
  impatiently in the dark for the primitive catch which held it to. A large
  and rusty bolt! she pulled at it&mdash;clumsily, for her hands were trembling.
  At last the gate flew open; she was out in the woods, peering into the moonlit
  thicket, listening for that most welcome sound, the footsteps of the man
  she loved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My prince!&rdquo; she exclaimed, for already he was beside her&mdash;apparently
  he had lain in wait for her, and now held her in his arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My beautiful and gracious lady,&rdquo; he murmured in that curiously
  muffled voice of his, which seemed to endow his strange personality with
  additional mystery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You heard? ... you saw just now? ...&rdquo; she asked timidly, fearful
  of encountering his jealous wrath, that vehement temper of his which she
  had learned to dread.</p>
  <p>Strangely enough he replied quite gently: &ldquo;Yes ... I saw ... the young
  man loves you, my beautiful Suzanne! ... and he will hate me now ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had always called her Suzanne&mdash;and her name thus spoken by him,
  and with that quaint foreign intonation of his had always sounded infinitely
  sweet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I love you with all my heart,&rdquo; she said earnestly, tenderly,
  her whole soul&mdash;young, ardent, full of romance, going out to him with
  all the strength of its purity and passion. &ldquo;What matter if all the
  world were against you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As a rule when they met thus on the confines of the wood, they would stand
  together by the gate, forming plans, talking of the future and of their love.
  Then after a while they would stroll into the park, he escorting her, as
  far as he might approach the house without being seen.</p>
  <p>She had no thought that Richard Lambert would be on the watch. Nay! so wholly
  absorbed was she in her love for this man, once she was in his presence,
  that already&mdash;womanlike&mdash;she had forgotten the young student&rsquo;s
  impassioned avowal, his jealousy, his very existence.</p>
  <p>And she loved these evening strolls in the great, peaceful park, at evening,
  when the birds were silent in their nests, and the great shadows of ivy-covered
  elms enveloped her and her romance. From afar a tiny light gleamed here and
  there in some of the windows of Acol Court.</p>
  <p>She had hated the grim, bare house at first, so isolated in the midst of
  the forests of Thanet, so like the eyrie of a bird of prey.</p>
  <p>But now she loved the whole place; the bit of ill-kept tangled garden, with
  its untidy lawn and weed-covered beds, in which a few standard rose-trees
  strove to find a permanent home; she loved the dark and mysterious park,
  the rusty gate, that wood with its rich carpet which varied as each season
  came around.</p>
  <p>To-night her lover was more gentle than had been his wont of late. They
  walked cautiously through the park, for the moon was brilliant and outlined
  every object with startling vividness. The trees here were sparser. Close
  by was the sunk fence and the tiny rustic bridge&mdash;only a plank or two&mdash;which
  spanned it.</p>
  <p>Some thirty yards ahead of them they could see the dark figure of Richard
  Lambert walking towards the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One more stroll beneath the trees, <i>ma mie</i>,&rdquo; he said
  lightly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll not wish to encounter your ardent suitor again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She loved him in this brighter mood, when he had thrown from him that mantle
  of jealousy and mistrust which of late had sat on him so ill.</p>
  <p>He seemed to have set himself the task of pleasing her to-night&mdash;of
  making her forget, mayhap, the wooing of the several suitors who had hung
  round her to-day. He talked to her&mdash;always in that mysterious, muffled
  voice, with the quaint rolling of the r&rsquo;s and the foreign intonation
  of the vowels&mdash;he talked to her of King Louis and his tyranny over the
  people of France: of his own political aims to which he had already sacrificed
  fortune, position, home. Of his own brilliant past at the most luxurious
  court the world had ever known. He fired her enthusiasm, delighted her imagination,
  enchained her soul to his: she was literally swept off the prosy face of
  this earth and whirled into a realm of romance, enchanting, intoxicating,
  mystic&mdash;almost divine.</p>
  <p>She forgot fleeting time, and did not even hear the church bell over at
  Acol village striking the hour of ten.</p>
  <p>He had to bring her back to earth, and to guide her reluctant footsteps
  again towards the house. But she was too happy to part from him so easily.
  She forced him to escort her over the little bridge, under the pretense of
  terror at the lateness of the hour. She vowed that he could not be perceived
  from the house, since all the lights were out, and everyone indeed must be
  abed. Her guardian&rsquo;s windows, moreover, gave on the other side of the
  house; and he of a surety would not be moon or star gazing at this hour of
  the night.</p>
  <p>Her mood was somewhat reckless. The talk with which he had filled her ears
  had gone to her brain like wine. She felt intoxicated with the atmosphere
  of mystery, of selfless patriotism, of great and fallen fortunes, with which
  he knew so well how to surround himself. Mayhap, that in her innermost heart
  now there was a scarce conscious desire to precipitate a crisis, to challenge
  discovery, to step boldly before her guardian, avowing her love, demanding
  the right to satisfy it.</p>
  <p>She refused to bid him adieu save at the garden door. Three steps led up
  straight into the dining-room from the flagged pathway which skirted the
  house. She ran up these steps, silently and swiftly as a little mouse, and
  then turned her proud and happy face to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night, sweet prince,&rdquo; she whispered, extending her delicate
  hand to him.</p>
  <p>She stood in the full light of the moon dominating him from the top of the
  steps, an exquisite vision of youth and beauty and romance.</p>
  <p>He took off his broad-brimmed hat, but his face was still in shadow, for
  the heavy perruque fell in thick dark curls covering both his cheeks. He
  bent very low and kissed the tips of her fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When shall we meet again, my prince?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This day week, an it please you, my queen,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
  <p>And then he turned to go. She meant to stand there and watch him cross the
  tangled lawn, and the little bridge, and to see him lose himself amidst the
  great shadows of the park.</p>
  <p>But he had scarce gone a couple of steps when a voice, issuing from the
  doorway close behind her, caused her to turn in quick alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sue! in the name of Heaven! what doth your ladyship here and at this
  hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The crisis which the young girl had almost challenged, had indeed arrived.
  Mistress de Chavasse&mdash;carrying a lighted and guttering candle, was standing
  close behind her. At the sound of her voice and Sue&rsquo;s little cry of
  astonishment rather than fear, Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans
  too, had paused, with a muttered curse on his lips, his foot angrily tapping
  the flagstones.</p>
  <p>But it were unworthy a gallant gentleman of the most chivalrous Court in
  the world to beat a retreat when his mistress was in danger of an unpleasant
  quarter of an hour.</p>
  <p>Sue was more than a little inclined to be defiant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mistress de Chavasse,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;will you be
  good enough to explain by what right you have spied on me to-night? Hath
  my guardian perchance set you to dog my footsteps?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was no thought in my mind of spying on your ladyship,&rdquo; rejoined
  Mistress de Chavasse coldly. &ldquo;I was troubled in my sleep and came downstairs
  because I heard a noise, and feared those midnight marauders of which we
  have heard so much of late. I myself had locked this door, and was surprised
  to find it unlatched. I opened it and saw you standing there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll all to bed, fair mistress,&rdquo; rejoined Sue gayly.
  She was too happy, too sure of herself and of her lover to view this sudden
  discovery of her secret with either annoyance or alarm. She would be free
  in three months, and he would be faithful to her. Love proverbially laughs
  at bars and bolts, and even if her stern guardian, apprised of her evening
  wanderings, prevented her from seeing her prince for the next three months,
  pshaw! a hundred days at most, and nothing could keep her from his side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night, fair prince,&rdquo; she repeated tenderly, extending
  her hand towards her lover once more, while throwing a look of proud defiance
  to Mistress de Chavasse. He could not help but return to the foot of the
  steps; any pusillanimity on his part at this juncture, any reluctance to
  meet Editha face to face or to bear the brunt of her reproaches and of her
  sneers, might jeopardize the romance of his personality in the eyes of Sue.
  Therefore he boldly took her hand and kissed it with mute fervor.</p>
  <p>She gave a happy little laugh and added pertly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night, mistress ... I&rsquo;ll leave you to make your own adieux
  to Monseigneur le Prince d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans. I&rsquo;ll warrant that
  you and he&mdash;despite the lateness of the hour&mdash;will have much to
  say to one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And without waiting to watch the issue of her suggestion, her eyes dancing
  with mischief, she turned and ran singing and laughing into the house.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; D&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans</b></h2>
  <p>At first it seemed as if the stranger meant to beat a precipitate and none
  too dignified retreat now that the adoring eyes of Lady Sue were no longer
  upon him. But Mistress de Chavasse had no intention of allowing him to extricate
  himself quite so easily from an unpleasant position.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One moment, master,&rdquo; she said loudly and peremptorily. &ldquo;Prince
  or whatever you may wish to call yourself ... ere you show me a clean pair
  of heels, I pray you to explain your presence here on Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s
  doorstep at ten o&rsquo;clock at night, and in company with his ward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment&mdash;a second or two only&mdash;the stranger appeared to hesitate.
  He paused with one foot still on the lowest of the stone steps, the other
  on the flagged path, his head bent, his hand upraised in the act of re-adjusting
  his broad-brimmed hat.</p>
  <p>Then a sudden thought seemed to strike him, he threw back his head, gave
  a short laugh as if he were pleased with this new thought, then turned, meeting
  Mistress de Chavasse&rsquo;s stern gaze squarely and fully. He threw his
  hat down upon the steps and crossed his arms over his chest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One moment, mistress?&rdquo; he said with an ironical bow. &ldquo;I
  do not need one moment. I have already explained.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Explained? how?&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;nay! I&rsquo;ll not be
  trifled with, master, and methinks you will find that Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse
  will expect some explanation&mdash;which will prove unpleasant to yourself&mdash;for
  your unwarrantable impudence in daring to approach his ward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He put up his hand in gentle deprecation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impudence? Oh, mistress?&rdquo; he said reproachfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me assure you, master,&rdquo; she continued with relentless severity, &ldquo;that
  you were wise an you returned straightway to your lodgings now ... packed
  your worldly goods and betook yourself and them to anywhere you please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he sighed gently, &ldquo;that is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would dare? ...&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would dare remain there, where my humble presence is most desired&mdash;beside
  the gracious lady who honors me with her love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are insolent, master ... and Sir Marmaduke ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he rejoined lightly, &ldquo;Sir Marmaduke doth not object.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, I fear me, you are in error, master! and in his name I now
  forbid you ever to attempt to speak to Lady Susannah Aldmarshe again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This command, accompanied by a look of withering scorn, seemed to afford
  the stranger vast entertainment. He made the wrathful lady a low, ironical
  bow, and clapped his hands together laughing and exclaiming:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brava! brava! of a truth but this is excellent! Pray, mistress, will
  you deign to tell me if in this your bidding you have asked Sir Marmaduke
  for his opinion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I need not to ask him. I ask you to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go? Whither?&rdquo; he asked blandly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out of my sight and off these grounds at once, ere I rouse the servants
  and have you whipped off like a dog!&rdquo; she said, angered beyond measure
  at his audacity, his irony, his manner, suggestive of insolent triumph. His
  muffled voice with its curious foreign accent irritated her, as did the shadow
  of his perruque over his brow, and the black silk shade which he wore over
  one eye.</p>
  <p>Even now in response to her violent outburst he broke into renewed laughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better and better! Ah, mistress,&rdquo; he said with a shake of the
  head, &ldquo;of a truth you are more blind than I thought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are more insolent, master, than I had thought possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet meseems, fair lady, that in the lonely and mysterious stranger
  you might have remembered your humble and devoted servant,&rdquo; he said,
  drawing his figure up towards her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You! an old friend!&rdquo; she said contemptuously. &ldquo;I have
  ne&rsquo;er set eyes on you in my life before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To think that the moon should be so treacherous,&rdquo; he rejoined
  imperturbably. &ldquo;Will you not look a little closer, fair mistress, the
  shadows are somewhat dark, mayhap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She felt his one eye fixed upon her with cold intentness, a strange feeling
  of superstitious dread suddenly crept over her from head to foot. Like a
  bird fascinated by a snake she came a little nearer, down the steps, towards
  him, her eyes, too, riveted on his face, that curious face of his, surrounded
  by the heavy perruque hiding ears and cheeks, the mouth overshadowed by the
  dark mustache, one eye concealed beneath the black silk shade.</p>
  <p>He seemed amused at her terror and as she came nearer to him, he too, advanced
  a little until their eyes met&mdash;his, mocking, amused, restless; hers,
  intent and searching.</p>
  <p>Thus they gazed at one another for a few seconds, whilst silence reigned
  around and the moon peered down cold and chaste from above, illumining the
  old house, the neglected garden, the vast park with its innumerable dark
  secrets and the mysteries which it hid.</p>
  <p>She was the first to step back, to recoil before the ironical intensity
  of that fixed gaze. She felt as if she were in a dream, as if a nightmare
  assailed her, which in her wakeful hours would be dissipated by reason, by
  common sense, by sound and sober fact.</p>
  <p>She even passed her hand across her eyes as if to sweep away from before
  her vision, a certain image which fancy had conjured up.</p>
  <p>His laugh&mdash;strident and mocking&mdash;roused her from this dreamlike
  state.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ... I ... do not understand,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet it is so simple,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;did you not ask me
  awhile ago if nothing could be done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who ... who are you?&rdquo; she whispered, and then repeated once
  again: &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am His Royal Highness, Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans,&rdquo; said
  Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse lightly, &ldquo;the kinsman of His Majesty, King
  Louis of France, the mysterious foreigner who works for the religious and
  political freedom of his country, and on whose head <i>le roi soleil</i> hath
  set a price ... and who, moreover, hath enflamed the romantic imagination
  of a beautiful young girl, thus winning her ardent love in the present and
  in the near future together with her vast fortune and estates.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He made a movement as if to remove his perruque but she stopped him with
  a gesture. She had understood. And in the brilliant moonlight a complete
  revelation of his personality might prove dangerous. Lady Sue herself might
  still&mdash;for aught they knew&mdash;be standing in the dark room behind&mdash;unseen
  yet on the watch.</p>
  <p>He seemed vastly amused at her terror, and boldly took the hand with which
  she had arrested his act of total revelation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! do you recognize your humble servant at last, fair Editha?&rdquo; he
  queried. &ldquo;On my honor, madam, Lady Sue is deeply enamored of me. What
  think you of my chances now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You? You?&rdquo; she repeated at intervals, mechanically, dazed still,
  lost in a whirl of conflicting emotions wherein fear, amazement, and a certain
  vein of superstitious horror fought a hard battle in her dizzy brain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The risks,&rdquo; she murmured more coherently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If she discover you, before ... before ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before she is legally my wife? Pshaw! ... Then of a truth my scheme
  will come to naught ... But will you not own, Editha, that &rsquo;tis worth
  the risk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Afterwards?&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Afterwards, mistress,&rdquo; he rejoined enigmatically, &ldquo;afterwards
  sits on the knees of the gods.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with a flourish of his broad-brimmed hat he turned on his heel and anon
  was lost in the shadows of the tall yew hedge.</p>
  <p>How long she stood there watching that spot whereon he had been standing,
  she could not say. Presently she shivered; the night had turned cold. She
  heard the cry of some small bird attacked by a midnight prowler; was it the
  sparrow-hawk after its prey?</p>
  <p>From the other side of the house came the sound of slow and firm footsteps,
  then the opening and shutting of a door.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse had played his part for to-night: silently as
  he had gone, so he returned to his room, whilst in another corner of the
  sparrow-hawk&rsquo;s nest a young girl slept, dreaming dreams of patriots
  and heroes, of causes nobly won, of poverty and obscurity gloriously endured.</p>
  <p>Mistress de Chavasse with a sigh half of regret, half of indifference, finally
  turned her back on the moonlit garden and went within.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  Secret Service</b></h2>
  <p>Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy was excessively perturbed. Matters at the Court
  were taking a curious turn. That something of unusual moment had happened
  within the last few days he was thoroughly convinced, and still having it
  in his mind that he was especially qualified for the lucrative appointments
  in my Lord Protector&rsquo;s secret service&mdash;he thought this an excellent
  opportunity for perfecting himself in the art of investigation, shrewdly
  conducted, which he understood to be most essential for the due fulfillment
  of such appointments.</p>
  <p>Thus we see him some few days later on a late afternoon, with back bent
  nearly double, eyes fixed steadily on the ground and his face a perfect mirror
  of thoughtful concentration within, slowly walking along the tiny footpath
  which wound in and out the groups of majestic elms in the park.</p>
  <p>Musing and meditating, at times uttering strange and enigmatical exclamations,
  he reached the confines of the private grounds, the spot where the surrounding
  wall gave place to a low iron gate, where the disused pavilion stood out
  gray and forlorn-looking in the midst of the soft green of the trees, and
  where through the woods beyond the gate, could just be perceived the tiny
  light which issued from the blacksmith&rsquo;s cottage, the most outlying
  one in the village of Acol.</p>
  <p>Master Hymn-of-Praise leaned thoughtfully against the ivy-covered wall.
  His eyes, roaming, searching, restless, pried all around him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Footprints!&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;footprints which of a surety
  must mean that human foot hath lately trod this moss. Footprints moreover,
  which lead up the steps to the door of that pavilion, wherein to my certain
  knowledge, no one hath had access of late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Something, of course, was going on at Acol Court, that strange and inexplicable
  something which he had tried to convey by covert suggestion to Mistress Charity&rsquo;s
  female&mdash;therefore inferior&mdash;brain.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s temper was more sour and ill even than of yore, and
  there was still an unpleasant sensation in the lumbar regions of Master Busy&rsquo;s
  spine, whenever he sat down, which recalled a somewhat vigorous outburst
  of his master&rsquo;s ill-humor.</p>
  <p>Mistress de Chavasse went about the house like a country wench frightened
  by a ghost, and Mistress Charity averred that she seldom went to bed now
  before midnight. Certain it is that Master Busy himself had met the lady
  wandering about the house candle in hand at an hour when all respectable
  folk should be abed, and when she almost fell up against Hymn-of-Praise in
  the dark she gave a frightened scream as if she had suddenly come face to
  face with the devil.</p>
  <p>Then there was her young ladyship.</p>
  <p>She was neither ill-tempered nor yet under the ban of fear, but Master Busy
  vowed unto himself that she was suffering from ill-concealed melancholy,
  from some hidden secret or wild romance. She seldom laughed, she had spoken
  with discourtesy and impatience to Squire Pyncheon, who rode over the other
  day on purpose to bring her a bunch of sweet marjoram which grew in great
  profusion in his mother&rsquo;s garden: she markedly avoided the company
  of her guardian, and wandered about the park alone, at all hours of the day&mdash;a
  proceeding which in a young lady of her rank was quite unseemly.</p>
  <p>All these facts neatly docketed in Master Busy&rsquo;s orderly brain, disturbed
  him not a little. He had not yet made up his mind as to the nature of the
  mystery which was surrounding the Court and its inmates, but vaguely he thought
  of abductions and elopements, which the presence of the richest heiress in
  the South of England in the house of the poorest squire in the whole country,
  more than foreshadowed.</p>
  <p>This lonely, somewhat eerie corner of the park appeared to be the center
  around which all the mysterious happenings revolved, and Master Hymn-of-Praise
  had found his way hither on this fine July afternoon, because he had distinct
  hopes of finding out something definite, certain facts which he then could
  place before Squire Boatfield who was major-general of the district, and
  who would then, doubtless, commend him for his ability and shrewdness in
  forestalling what might prove to be a terrible crime.</p>
  <p>The days were getting shorter now; it was little more than eight o&rsquo;clock
  and already the shades of evening were drawing closely in: the last rays
  of the setting sun had long disappeared in a glowing haze of gold, and the
  fantastic branches of the old elms, intertwined with the parasitic ivy looked
  grim and threatening, silhouetted against the lurid after glow. Master Busy
  liked neither the solitude, nor yet the silence of the woods; he had just
  caught sight of a bat circling over the dilapidated roof of the pavilion,
  and he hated bats. Though he belonged to a community which denied the angels
  and ignored the saints, he had a firm belief in the existence of a tangible
  devil, and somehow he could not dissociate his ideas of hell and of evil
  spirits from those which related to the mysterious flutterings of bats.</p>
  <p>Moreover he thought that his duties in connection with the science of secret
  investigation, had been sufficiently fulfilled for the day, and he prepared
  to wend his way back to the house, when the sound of voices, once more aroused
  his somnolent attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Someone,&rdquo; he murmured within himself, &ldquo;the heiress and
  the abductor mayhap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This might prove the opportunity of his life, the chance which would place
  him within the immediate notice of the major-general, perhaps of His Highness
  the Protector himself. He felt that to vacate his post of observation at
  this moment would be unworthy the moral discipline which an incipient servant
  of the Commonwealth should impose upon himself.</p>
  <p>Striving to smother a sense of terror, or to disguise it even to himself
  under the mask of officiousness, he looked about for a hiding-place&mdash;a
  post of observation as he called it.</p>
  <p>A tree with invitingly forked branches seemed to be peculiarly adapted to
  his needs. Hymn-of-Praise was neither very young nor very agile, but dreams
  of coming notoriety lent nimbleness to his limbs.</p>
  <p>By the time that the voices drew nearer, the sober butler of Acol Court
  was installed astride an elm bough, hidden by the dense foliage and by the
  leaf-laden strands of ivy, enfolded by the fast gathering shadows of evening,
  supremely uncomfortable physically, none too secure on his perch, yet proud
  and satisfied in the consciousness of fulfilled duty.</p>
  <p>The next moment he caught sight of Mistress Charity&mdash;Mistress Charity
  so please you, who had plighted her troth to him, walking arm in arm with
  Master Courage Toogood, as impudent, insolent and debauched a young jackanapes
  as ever defaced the forests of Thanet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mistress, fair mistress,&rdquo; he was sighing, and murmuring in
  her ear, &ldquo;the most beautiful and gracious thing on God&rsquo;s earth,
  when I hold you pressed thus against my beating heart ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Apparently his feelings were too deep to be expressed in the words of his
  own vocabulary, for he paused a while, sighed audibly, and then asked anxiously:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do hear my heart beating, mistress, do you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She blushed, for she was naught but a female baggage, and though Master
  Busy&rsquo;s impassioned protestations of less than half an hour ago, must
  be still ringing in her ears, she declared emphatically that she could hear
  the throbbing of that young vermin&rsquo;s heart.</p>
  <p>Master Busy up aloft was quite sure that what she heard was a few sheep
  and cattle of Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s who were out to grass in a field close
  by, and had been scared into a canter.</p>
  <p>What went on for the next moment or two the saintly man on the elm tree
  branch could not rightly perceive, but the next words from Mistress Charity&rsquo;s
  lips sent a thrill of indignation through his heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! Master Courage,&rdquo; she said with a little cry, &ldquo;you
  must not squeeze me so! I vow you have taken the breath out of my body! The
  Lord love you, child! think you I can stay here all this while and listen
  to your nonsense?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just one minute longer, fair mistress,&rdquo; entreated the young
  reprobate, &ldquo;the moon is not yet up, the birds have gone to their nests
  for sleep, will ye not tarry a while here with me? That old fool Busy will
  never know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It is a fact that at this juncture the saintly man well-nigh fell off his
  perch, and when Master Courage, amidst many coy shrieks from the fickle female,
  managed to drag her down beside him, upon the carpet of moss immediately
  beneath the very tree whereon Hymn-of-Praise was holding watch, the unfortunate
  man had need of all his strength of mind and of purpose not to jump down
  with both feet upon the lying face of that young limb of Satan.</p>
  <p>But he felt that the discovery of his somewhat undignified position by these
  two evil-doers would not at this moment be quite opportune, so he endeavored
  to maintain his equilibrium at the cost of supreme discomfort, and the loud
  cracking of the branch on which he was perched.</p>
  <p>Mistress Charity gave a cry of terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing, mistress, I swear,&rdquo; rejoined Courage reassuringly, &ldquo;there
  are always noises in old elm trees, the ivy hangs heavy and ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have heard it said of late that the pavilion is haunted,&rdquo; she
  murmured under her breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! not haunted, mistress! I vow &rsquo;tis but the crackling of
  loose branches, and there is that which I would whisper in your ear ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But before Master Courage had the time to indulge in this, the desire of
  his heart, something fell upon the top of his lean head which certainly never
  grew on the elm tree overhead. Having struck his lanky hair the object fell
  straight into his lap.</p>
  <p>It was a button. An ordinary, brown, innocent enough looking button. But
  still a button. Master Courage took it in his hand and examined it carefully,
  turning it over once or twice. The little thing certainly wore a familiar
  air. Master Courage of a truth had seen such an one before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That thing never grew up there, master,&rdquo; said Mistress Charity
  in an agitated whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he rejoined emphatically, &ldquo;nor yet doth a button
  form part of the habiliments of a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But not a sound came from above: and though Courage and Charity peered upwards
  with ever-increasing anxiety, the fast gathering darkness effectually hid
  the mystery which lurked within that elm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I vow that there&rsquo;s something up there, mistress,&rdquo; said
  the youth with sudden determination.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could it be bats, master?&rdquo; she queried with a shudder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! but bats do not wear buttons,&rdquo; he replied sententiously. &ldquo;Yet
  of a surety, I mean to make an investigation of the affair as that old fool
  Hymn-of-Praise would say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon, heedless of Mistress Charity&rsquo;s ever-growing agitation,
  he ran towards the boundary wall of the park, and vaulted the low gate with
  an agile jump even as she uttered a pathetic appeal to him not to leave her
  alone in the dark.</p>
  <p>Fear had rooted the girl to the spot. She dared not move away, fearful lest
  her running might entice that mysterious owner of the brown button to hurry
  in her track. Yet she would have loved to follow Master Courage, and to put
  at least a gate and wall between herself and those terrible elms.</p>
  <p>She was just contemplating a comprehensive and vigorous attack of hysterics
  when she heard Master Courage&rsquo;s voice from the other side of the gate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hist! Hist, mistress! Quick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She gathered up what shreds of valor she possessed and ran blindly in the
  direction whence came the welcome voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you take this,&rdquo; said the youth, who was holding a wooden
  bucket out over the gate, &ldquo;whilst I climb back to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what is it, master?&rdquo; she asked, as&mdash;obeying him mechanically&mdash;she
  took the bucket from him. It was heavy, for it was filled almost to the brim
  with a liquid which seemed very evil-smelling.</p>
  <p>The next moment Master Courage was standing beside her. He took the bucket
  from her and then walked as rapidly as he could with it back towards the
  elm tree.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will help me to dislodge the bats, mistress,&rdquo; he said enigmatically,
  speaking over his shoulder as he walked.</p>
  <p>She followed him&mdash;excited but timorous&mdash;until together they once
  more reached the spot, where Master Courage&rsquo;s amorous declarations
  had been so rudely interrupted. He put the bucket down beside him, and rubbed
  his hands together whilst uttering certain sounds which betrayed his glee.</p>
  <p>Then only did she notice that he was carrying under one arm a long curious-looking
  instrument&mdash;round and made of tin, with a handle at one end.</p>
  <p>She looked curiously into the bucket and at the instrument.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the tar-water used for syringing the cattle,&rdquo; she
  whispered, &ldquo;ye must not touch it, master. Where did you find it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just by the wall,&rdquo; he rejoined. &ldquo;I knew it was kept there.
  They wash the sheep with it to destroy the vermin in them. This is the squirt
  for it,&rdquo; he added calmly, placing the end of the instrument in the
  liquid, &ldquo;and I will mayhap destroy the vermin which is lodged in that
  elm tree.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A cry of terror issuing from above froze the very blood in Mistress Charity&rsquo;s
  veins.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop! stop! you young limb of Satan!&rdquo; came from Master Busy&rsquo;s
  nearly choking throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s evildoers or evil spirits, master,&rdquo; cried Mistress
  Charity in an agony of fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever it be, mistress, this should destroy it!&rdquo; said Master
  Courage philosophically, as turning the syringe upwards he squirted the whole
  of its contents straight into the fork of the ivy-covered branches.</p>
  <p>There was a cry of rage, followed by a cry of terror, then Master Hymn-of-Praise
  Busy with a terrific clatter of breaking boughs, fell in a heap upon the
  soft carpet of moss.</p>
  <p>Master Courage be it said to the eternal shame of venturesome youth, took
  incontinently to his heels, leaving Mistress Charity to bear the brunt of
  the irate saintly man&rsquo;s wrath.</p>
  <p>Master Busy, we must admit had but little saintliness left in him now. Let
  us assume that&mdash;as he explained afterwards&mdash;he was not immediately
  aware of Mistress Charity&rsquo;s presence, and that his own sense of propriety
  and of decorum had been drowned in a cataract of tar water. Certain it is
  that a volley of oaths, which would have surprised Sir Marmaduke himself,
  escaped his lips.</p>
  <p>Had he not every excuse? He was dripping from head to foot, spluttering,
  blinded, choked and bruised.</p>
  <p>He shook himself like a wet spaniel. Then hearing the sound of a smothered
  exclamation which did not seem altogether unlike a giggle, he turned round
  savagely and perceived the dim outline of Mistress Charity&rsquo;s dainty
  figure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Lord love thee, Master Hymn-of-Praise,&rdquo; she began, somewhat
  nervously, &ldquo;but you have made yourself look a sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And by G&mdash;d I&rsquo;ll make that young jackanapes look a sight
  ere I take my hand off him,&rdquo; he retorted savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what were you ... hem! what wert thou doing up in the elm tree,
  friend Hymn-of-Praise?&rdquo; she asked demurely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thee me no thou!&rdquo; he said with enigmatic pompousness, followed
  by a distinctly vicious snarl, &ldquo;Master Busy will be my name in future
  for a saucy wench like thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned towards the house. Mistress Charity following meekly&mdash;somewhat
  subdued, for Master Busy was her affianced husband, and she had no mind to
  mar her future, through any of young Courage&rsquo;s dare-devil escapades.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou wouldst wish to know what I was doing up in that forked tree?&rdquo; he
  asked her with calm dignity after a while, when the hedges of the flower
  garden came in sight. &ldquo;I was making a home for thee, according to the
  commands of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not in the elm trees of a surety, Master Busy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was making a home for thee,&rdquo; he repeated without heeding
  her flippant observation, &ldquo;by rendering myself illustrious. I told
  thee, wench, did I not? that something was happening within the precincts
  of Acol Court, and that it is my duty to lie in wait and to watch. The heiress
  is about to be abducted, and it is my task to frustrate the evil designs
  of the mysterious criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked at him in speechless amazement. He certainly looked strangely
  weird in the semi-darkness with his lanky hair plastered against his cheeks,
  his collar half torn from round his neck, the dripping, oily substance flowing
  in rivulets from his garments down upon the ground.</p>
  <p>The girl had no longer any desire to laugh, and when Master Busy strode
  majestically across the rustic bridge, then over the garden paths to the
  kitchen quarter of the house, she followed him without a word, awed by his
  extraordinary utterances, vaguely feeling that in his dripping garments he
  somehow reminded her of Jonah and the whale.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  Avowed Enmity</b></h2>
  <p>The pavilion had been built some fifty years ago, by one of the Spantons
  of Acol who had a taste for fanciful architecture.</p>
  <p>It had been proudly held by several deceased representatives of the family
  to be the reproduction of a Greek temple. It certainly had columns supporting
  the portico, and steps leading thence to the ground. It was also circular
  in shape and was innocent of windows, deriving its sole light from the door,
  when it was open.</p>
  <p>The late Sir Jeremy, I believe, had been very fond of the place. Being of
  a somewhat morose and taciturn disposition, he liked the seclusion of this
  lonely corner of the park. He had a chair or two put into the pavilion and &rsquo;twas
  said that he indulged there in the smoking of that fragrant weed which of
  late had been more generously imported into this country.</p>
  <p>After Sir Jeremy&rsquo;s death, the pavilion fell into disuse. Sir Marmaduke
  openly expressed his dislike of the forlorn hole, as he was wont to call
  it. He caused the door to be locked, and since then no one had entered the
  little building. The key, it was presumed, had been lost; the lock certainly
  looked rusty. The roof, too, soon fell into disrepair, and no doubt within,
  the place soon became the prey of damp and mildew, the nest of homing birds,
  or the lair of timid beasts. Very soon the proud copy of an archaic temple
  took on that miserable and forlorn look peculiar to uninhabited spots.</p>
  <p>From an air of abandonment to that of eeriness was but a step, and now the
  building towered in splendid isolation, in this remote corner of the park,
  at the confines of the wood, with a reputation for being the abode of ghosts,
  of bats and witches, and other evil things.</p>
  <p>When Master Busy sought for tracks of imaginary criminals bent on abducting
  the heiress he naturally drifted to this lonely spot; when Master Courage
  was bent on whispering sweet nothings into the ear of the other man&rsquo;s
  betrothed, he enticed her to that corner of the park where he was least like
  to meet the heavy-booted saint.</p>
  <p>Thus it was that these three met on the one spot where as a rule at a late
  hour of the evening Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans was
  wont to commence his wanderings, sure of being undisturbed, and with the
  final disappearance of Master Busy and Mistress Charity the place was once
  more deserted.</p>
  <p>The bats once more found delight in this loneliness and from all around
  came that subdued murmur, that creaking of twigs, that silence so full of
  subtle sounds, which betrays the presence of animal life on the prowl.</p>
  <p>Anon there came the harsh noise of a key grating in a rusty lock. The door
  of the pavilion was cautiously opened from within and the mysterious French
  prince, bewigged, booted and hatted, emerged into the open. The night had
  drawn a singularly dark mantle over the woods. Banks of cloud obscured the
  sky; the tall elm trees with their ivy-covered branches, and their impenetrable
  shadows beneath, formed a dense wall which the sight of human creatures was
  not keen enough to pierce. Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, in spite of this darkness,
  which he hailed gleefully, peered cautiously and intently round as he descended
  the steps.</p>
  <p>He had not met Lady Sue in the capacity of her romantic lover since that
  evening a week ago, when his secret had been discovered by Mistress de Chavasse.
  The last vision he had had of the young girl was one redolent of joy and
  love and trust, sufficient to reassure him that all was well with her, in
  regard to his schemes; but on that same evening a week ago he had gazed upon
  another little scene, which had not filled him with either joy or security.</p>
  <p>He had seen Lady Sue standing beside a young man whose personality&mdash;to
  say the least&mdash;was well-nigh as romantic as that of the exiled scion
  of the house of Orl&eacute;ans. He had seen rather than heard a young and
  passionate nature pouring into girlish ears the avowal of an unselfish and
  ardent love which had the infinite merit of being real and true.</p>
  <p>However well he himself might play his part of selfless hero and of vehement
  lover, there always lurked the danger that the falseness of his protestations
  would suddenly ring a warning note to the subtle sense of the confiding girl.
  Were it not for the intense romanticism of her disposition, which beautified
  and exalted everything with which it came in contact, she would of a surety
  have detected the lie ere this. He had acted his dual r&ocirc;le with consummate
  skill, the contrast between the surly Puritanical guardian, with his round
  cropped head and shaven face, and the elegantly dressed cavalier, with a
  heavy mustache, an enormous perruque and a shade over one eye, was so complete
  that even Mistress de Chavasse&mdash;alert, suspicious, wholly unromantic,
  had been momentarily deceived, and would have remained so but for his voluntary
  revelation of himself.</p>
  <p>But the watchful and disappointed young lover was the real danger: a danger
  complicated by the fact that the Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans
  actually dwelt in the cottage owned by Lambert&rsquo;s brother, the blacksmith.
  The mysterious prince had perforce to dwell somewhere; else, whenever spied
  by a laborer or wench from the village, he would have excited still further
  comment, and his movements mayhap would have been more persistently dogged.</p>
  <p>For this reason Sir Marmaduke had originally chosen Adam Lambert&rsquo;s
  cottage to be his headquarters; it stood on the very outskirts of the village
  and as he had only the wood to traverse between it and the pavilion where
  he effected his change of personality, he ran thus but few risks of meeting
  prying eyes. Moreover, Adam Lambert, the blacksmith, and the old woman who
  kept house for him, both belonged to the new religious sect which Judge Bennett
  had so pertinently dubbed the Quakers, and they kept themselves very much
  aloof from gossip and the rest of the village.</p>
  <p>True, Richard Lambert oft visited his brother and the old woman, but did
  so always in the daytime when Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans
  carefully kept out of the way. Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse had all the true
  instincts of the beast or bird of prey. He prowled about in the dark, and
  laid his snares for the seizure of his victim under cover of the night.</p>
  <p>This evening certain new schemes had found birth in his active mind; he
  was impatient that the victim tarried, when his brain was alive with thoughts
  of how to effect a more speedy capture. He leaned against the wall, close
  by the gate as was his wont when awaiting Sue, smiling grimly to himself
  at thought of the many little subterfuges she would employ to steal out of
  the house, without encountering&mdash;as she thought&mdash;her watchful guardian.</p>
  <p>A voice close behind him&mdash;speaking none too kindly&mdash;broke in on
  his meditations, causing him to start&mdash;almost to crouch like a frightened
  cat.</p>
  <p>The next moment he had recognized the gruff and nasal tones of Adam Lambert.
  Apparently the blacksmith had just come from the wood through the gate, and
  had almost stumbled in the dark against the rigid figure of his mysterious
  lodger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Friend, what dost thou here?&rdquo; he asked peremptorily. But already
  Sir Marmaduke had recovered from that sudden sense of fear which had caused
  him to start in alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would ask the same question of you, my friend,&rdquo; he retorted
  airily, speaking in the muffled voice and with the markedly foreign accent
  which he had assumed for the r&ocirc;le of the Prince, &ldquo;might I inquire
  what you are doing here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have to see a sick mare down Minster way,&rdquo; replied Lambert
  curtly, &ldquo;this is a short cut thither, and Sir Marmaduke hath granted
  me leave. But he liketh not strangers loitering in his park.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, friend,&rdquo; rejoined the other lightly, &ldquo;when Sir
  Marmaduke doth object to my strolling in his garden, he will doubtless apprise
  me of the fact, without interference from you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Adam Lambert, after his uncivil greeting of his lodger, had already turned
  his back on him, loath to have further speech with a man whom he hated and
  despised.</p>
  <p>Like the majority of country folk these days, the blacksmith had a wholesale
  contempt for every foreigner, and more particularly for those who hailed
  from France: that country&mdash;in the estimation of all Puritans, Dissenters
  and Republicans&mdash;being the happy abode of every kind of immorality and
  debauchery.</p>
  <p>Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans&mdash;as he styled himself&mdash;with
  his fantastic clothes, his airs and graces and long, curly hair was an object
  of special aversion to the Quaker, even though the money which the despised
  foreigner paid for his lodgings was passing welcome these hard times.</p>
  <p>Adam resolutely avoided speech with the Prince, whenever possible, but the
  latter&rsquo;s provocative and sarcastic speech roused his dormant hatred;
  like a dog who has been worried, he now turned abruptly round and faced Sir
  Marmaduke, stepping close up to him, his eyes glaring with vindictive rage,
  a savage snarl rising in his throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take notice, friend,&rdquo; he said hoarsely, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ll
  not bear thine impudence. Thou mayest go and bully the old woman at the cottage
  when I am absent&mdash;Oh! I&rsquo;ve heard thee!&rdquo; he added with unbridled
  savagery, &ldquo;ordering her about as if she were thy serving wench ...
  but let me tell thee that she is no servant of thine, nor I ... so have done,
  my fine prince ... dost understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prithee, friend, do not excite yourself,&rdquo; said Sir Marmaduke
  blandly, drawing back against the wall as far as he could to avoid close
  proximity with his antagonist. &ldquo;I have never wished to imply that Mistress
  Lambert was aught but my most obliging, most amiable landlady&mdash;nor have
  I, to my certain knowledge, overstepped the privileges of a lodger. I trust
  that your worthy aunt hath no cause for complaint. Mistress Lambert is your
  aunt?&rdquo; he added superciliously, &ldquo;is she not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is nothing to thee,&rdquo; muttered the other, &ldquo;if she
  be my aunt or no, as far as I can see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely not. I asked in a spirit of polite inquiry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But apparently this subject was one which had more than any other the power
  to rouse the blacksmith&rsquo;s savage temper. He fought with it for a moment
  or two, for anger is the Lord&rsquo;s, and strict Quaker discipline forbade
  such unseemly wrangling. But Adam was a man of violent temperament which
  his strict religious training had not altogether succeeded in holding in
  check: the sneers of the foreign prince, his calm, supercilious attitude,
  broke the curb which religion had set upon his passion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! thou art mighty polite to me, my fine gentleman,&rdquo; he said
  vehemently. &ldquo;Thou knowest what I think of thy lazy foreign ways ...
  why dost thou not do a bit of honest work, instead of hanging round her ladyship&rsquo;s
  skirts? ... If I were to say a word to Sir Marmaduke, &rsquo;twould be mightily
  unpleasant for thee, an I mistake not. Oh! I know what thou&rsquo;rt after,
  with thy fine ways, and thy romantic, lying talk of liberty and patriotism!
  ... the heiress, eh, friend? That is thy design.... I am not blind, I tell
  thee.... I have seen thee and her ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke laughed lightly, shrugging his shoulders in token of indifference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite so, quite so, good master,&rdquo; he said suavely, &ldquo;do
  ye not waste your breath in speaking thus loudly. I understand that your
  sentiments towards me do not partake of that Christian charity of which ye
  and yours do prate at times so loudly. But I&rsquo;ll not detain you. Doubtless
  worthy Mistress Lambert will be awaiting you, or is it the sick mare down
  Minster way that hath first claim on your amiability? I&rsquo;ll not detain
  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned as if to go, but Adam&rsquo;s hard grip was on his shoulder in
  an instant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! thou&rsquo;lt not detain me&mdash;&rsquo;tis I am detaining
  thee!&rdquo; said the blacksmith hoarsely, &ldquo;for I desired to tell thee
  that thy ugly French face is abhorrent to me ... I do not hold with princes....
  For a prince is none better than another man nay, he is worse an he loafs
  and steals after heiresses and their gold ... and will not do a bit of honest
  work.... Work makes the man.... Work and prayer ... not your titles and fine
  estates. This is a republic now ... understand? ... no king, no House of
  Lords&mdash;please the Lord neither clergymen nor noblemen soon.... I work
  with my hands ... and am not ashamed. The Lord Saviour was a carpenter and
  not a prince.... My brother is a student and a gentleman&mdash;as good as
  any prince&mdash;understand? Ten thousand times as good as thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He relaxed his grip which had been hard as steel on Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s
  shoulder. It was evident that he had been nursing hatred and loathing against
  his lodger for some time, and that to-night the floodgates of his pent-up
  wrath had been burst asunder through the mysterious prince&rsquo;s taunts,
  and insinuations anent the cloud and secrecy which hung round the Lamberts&rsquo; parentage.</p>
  <p>Though his shoulder was painful and bruised under the pressure of the blacksmith&rsquo;s
  rough fingers, Sir Marmaduke did not wince. He looked his avowed enemy boldly
  in the face, with no small measure of contempt for the violence displayed.</p>
  <p>His own enmity towards those who thwarted him was much more subtle, silent
  and cautious. He would never storm and rage, show his enmity openly and caution
  his antagonist through an outburst of rage. Adam Lambert still glaring into
  his lodger&rsquo;s eye, encountered nothing therein but irony and indulgent
  contempt.</p>
  <p>Religion forbade him to swear. Yet was he sorely tempted, and we may presume
  that he cursed inwardly, for his enemy refused to be drawn into wordy warfare,
  and he himself had exhausted his vocabulary of sneering abuse, even as he
  had exhausted his breath.</p>
  <p>Perhaps in his innermost heart he was ashamed of his outburst. After all,
  he had taken this man&rsquo;s money, and had broken bread with him. His hand
  dropped to his side, and his head fell forward on his breast even as with
  a pleasant laugh the prince carelessly turned away, and with an affected
  gesture brushed his silken doublet, there where the blacksmith&rsquo;s hard
  grip had marred the smoothness of the delicate fabric.</p>
  <p>Had Adam Lambert possessed that subtle sixth sense, which hears and sees
  that which goes on in the mind of others, he had perceived a thought in his
  lodger&rsquo;s brain cells which might have caused him to still further regret
  his avowal of open enmity.</p>
  <p>For as the blacksmith finally turned away and walked off through the park,
  skirting the boundary wall, Sir Marmaduke looked over his shoulder at the
  ungainly figure which was soon lost in the gloom, and muttered a round oath
  between his teeth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An exceedingly unpleasant person,&rdquo; he vowed within himself, &ldquo;you
  will have to be removed, good master, an you get too troublesome.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  Surrender</b></h2>
  <p>But this interview with the inimical Quaker had more than strengthened Sir
  Marmaduke&rsquo;s design to carry his bold scheme more rapidly to its successful
  issue.</p>
  <p>The game which he had played with grave risks for over three months now
  had begun to be dangerous. The mysterious patriot from France could not afford
  to see prying enemies at his heels.</p>
  <p>Anon when the graceful outline of Lady Sue&rsquo;s figure emerged from out
  the surrounding gloom, Sir Marmaduke went forward to meet her, and clasped
  her to him in a passionate embrace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My gracious lady ... my beautiful Sue ...&rdquo; he murmured whilst
  he covered her hands, her brow, her hair with ardent kisses, &ldquo;you have
  come so late&mdash;and I have been so weary of waiting ... waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He led her through the gardens to where one gigantic elm, grander than its
  fellows, had thrown out huge gnarled roots which protruded from out the ground.
  One of these, moss-covered, green and soft, formed a perfect resting place.
  He drew her down, begging her to sit. She obeyed, scared somewhat as was
  her wont when she found him so unfettered and violent.</p>
  <p>He stretched himself at full length at her feet, extravagant now in his
  acts and gestures like a man who no longer can hold turbulent passion in
  check. He kissed the edge of her kirtle, then her cloak and the tips of her
  little shoes:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was cruel to keep me waiting ... gracious lady&mdash;it was cruel,&rdquo; he
  murmured in the intervals between these ardent caresses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am so sorry, Am&eacute;d&eacute;,&rdquo; she repeated, grieving
  to see him so sorrowful, not a little frightened at his vehemence,&mdash;trying
  to withdraw her hands from his grasp. &ldquo;I was detained ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Detained,&rdquo; he rejoined harshly, &ldquo;detained by someone
  else ... someone who had a greater claim on your time than the poor exile
  ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! &rsquo;tis unkind thus to grieve me,&rdquo; she said with tender
  reproach as she felt the hot tears gather in her eyes. &ldquo;You know&mdash;as
  I do&mdash;that I am not my own mistress yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! yes! forgive me&mdash;my gracious, sweet, sweet lady.... I am
  mad when you are not nigh me.... You do not know&mdash;how could you? ...
  what torments I endure, when I think of you so beautiful, so exquisite, so
  adorable, surrounded by other men who admire you ... desire you, mayhap....
  Oh! my God! ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you need have no fear,&rdquo; she protested gently, &ldquo;you
  know that I gave my whole heart willingly to you ... my prince ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, but you cannot know,&rdquo; he persisted violently, &ldquo;sweet,
  gentle creature that you are, you cannot guess the agonies which a strong
  man endures when he is gnawed by ruthless insane jealousy ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She gave a cry of pain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am&eacute;d&eacute;!&rdquo; for she felt hurt, deeply wounded by
  his mistrust of her, when she had so wholly, so fully trusted him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know ... I know,&rdquo; he said with quick transition of tone,
  fearful that he had offended her, striving to master his impatience, to find
  words which best pleased her young, romantic temperament, &ldquo;Nay! but
  you must think me mad.... Mayhap you despise me,&rdquo; he added with a gentle
  note of sadness. &ldquo;Oh, God! ... mayhap you will turn from me now....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet do I worship you ... my saint ... my divinity ... my Suzanne....
  You are more beautiful, more adorable than any woman in the world ... and
  I am so unworthy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You unworthy!&rdquo; she retorted, laughing gayly through her tears. &ldquo;You,
  my prince, my king! ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say that once more, my Suzanne,&rdquo; he murmured with infinite
  gentleness, &ldquo;oh! the exquisite sweetness of your voice, which is like
  dream-music in mine ears.... Oh! to hold you in my arms thus, for ever ...
  until death, sweeter than life ... came to me in one long passionate kiss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She allowed him to put his arms round her now, glad that the darkness hid
  the blush on her cheeks; thus she loved him, thus she had first learned to
  love him, ardent, oh, yes! but so gentle, so meek, yet so great and exalted
  in his selfless patriotism.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not of death you should speak, sweet prince,&rdquo; she
  said, ineffably happy now that she felt him more subdued, more trusting and
  fond, &ldquo;rather should you speak of life ... with me, your own Suzanne
  ... of happiness in the future, when you and I, hand in hand, will work together
  for that great cause you hold so dear ... the freedom and liberties of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; he sighed in utter dejection, &ldquo;when that happy
  time comes ... but ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do not trust me?&rdquo; she asked reproachfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With all my heart, my Suzanne,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but you
  are so beautiful, so rich ... and other men ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are no other men for me,&rdquo; she retorted simply. &ldquo;I
  love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you prove it to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be mine ... mine absolutely,&rdquo; he urged eagerly with passion
  just sufficiently subdued to make her pulses throb. &ldquo;Be my wife ...
  my princess ... let me feel that no one could come between us....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But my guardian would never consent,&rdquo; she protested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely your love for me can dispense with Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s consent....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A secret marriage?&rdquo; she asked, terrified at this strange vista
  which his fiery imagination was conjuring up before her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You refuse? ...&rdquo; he asked hoarsely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! ... but ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you do not love me, Suzanne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The coolness in his tone struck a sudden chill to her heart. She felt the
  clasp of his arms round her relax, she felt rather than saw that he withdrew
  markedly from her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! forgive me! forgive me!&rdquo; she murmured, stretching her little
  hands out to him in a pathetic and childlike appeal. &ldquo;I have never
  deceived anyone in my life before.... How could I live a lie? ... married
  to you, yet seemingly a girl.... Whilst in three months....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused in her eagerness, for he had jumped to his feet and was now standing
  before her, a rigid, statuesque figure, with head bent and arms hanging inert
  by his side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do not love me, Suzanne,&rdquo; he said with an infinity of sadness,
  which went straight to her own loving heart, &ldquo;else you would not dream
  of thus condemning me to three months of exquisite torture.... I have had
  my answer.... Farewell, my gracious lady ... not mine, alas! but another
  man&rsquo;s ... and may Heaven grant that he love you well ... not as I do,
  for that were impossible....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His voice had died away in a whisper, which obviously was half-choked with
  tears. She, too, had risen while he spoke, all her hesitation gone, her heart
  full of reproaches against herself, and of love for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked trembling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I must go,&rdquo; he replied simply, &ldquo;since you do not
  love me....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Oh! how thankful she was that this merciful darkness enwrapped her so tenderly.
  She was so young, so innocent and pure, that she felt half ashamed of the
  expression of her own great love which went out to him in a veritable wave
  of passion, when she began to fear that she was about to lose him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she cried vehemently, &ldquo;you shall not go ...
  you shall not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her hands sought his in the gloom, and found them, clung to them with ever-growing
  ardor; she came quite close to him trying to peer into his face and to let
  him read in hers all the pathetic story of her own deep love for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she murmured through her tears. And again she
  repeated: &ldquo;I love you. See,&rdquo; she added with sudden determination, &ldquo;I
  will do e&rsquo;en as you wish.... I will follow you to the uttermost ends
  of the earth.... I ... I will marry you ... secretly ... an you wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Welcome darkness that hid her blushes! ... she was so young&mdash;so ignorant
  of life and of the world&mdash;yet she felt that by her words, her promise,
  her renunciation of her will, she was surrendering something to this man,
  which she could never, never regain.</p>
  <p>Did the first thought of fear, or misgiving cross her mind at this moment?
  It were impossible to say. The darkness which to her was so welcome was&mdash;had
  she but guessed it&mdash;infinitely cruel too, for it hid the look of triumph,
  of rapacity, of satisfied ambition which at her selfless surrender had involuntarily
  crept into Marmaduke&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  A Woman&rsquo;s Heart</b></h2>
  <p>It is difficult, perhaps, to analyze rightly the feelings and sensations
  of a young girl, when she is literally being swept off her feet in a whirlpool
  of passion and romance.</p>
  <p>Some few years later when Lady Sue wrote those charming memoirs which are
  such an interesting record of her early life, she tried to note with faithful
  accuracy what was the exact state of her mind when three months after her
  first meeting with Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans, she
  plighted her troth to him and promised to marry him in secret and in defiance
  of her guardian&rsquo;s more than probable opposition.</p>
  <p>Her sentiments with regard to her mysterious lover were somewhat complex,
  and undoubtedly she was too young, too inexperienced then to differentiate
  between enthusiastic interest in a romantic personality, and real, lasting,
  passionate love for a man, as apart from any halo of romance which might
  be attached to him.</p>
  <p>When she was a few years older she averred that she could never have really
  loved her prince, because she always feared him. Hers, therefore, was not
  the perfect love that casteth out fear. She was afraid of him in his ardent
  moods, almost as much as when he allowed his unbridled temper free rein.
  Whenever she walked through the dark bosquets of the park, on her way to
  a meeting with her lover, she was invariably conscious of a certain trepidation
  of all her nerves, a wonderment as to what he would say when she saw him,
  how he would act; whether chide, or rave, or merely reproach.</p>
  <p>It was the gentle and pathetic terror of a child before a stern yet much-loved
  parent. Yet she never mistrusted him ... perhaps because she had never really
  seen him&mdash;only in outline, half wrapped in shadows, or merely silhouetted
  against a weirdly lighted background. His appearance had no tangible reality
  for her. She was in love with an ideal, not with a man ... he was merely
  the mouthpiece of an individuality which was of her own creation.</p>
  <p>Added to all this there was the sense of isolation. She had lost her mother
  when she was a baby; her father fell at Naseby. She herself had been an only
  child, left helplessly stranded when the civil war dispersed her relations
  and friends, some into exile, others in splendid revolt within the fastnesses
  of their own homes, impoverished by pillage and sequestration, rebellious,
  surrounded by spies, watching that opportunity for retaliation which was
  so slow in coming.</p>
  <p>Tossed hither and thither by Fate in spite of&mdash;or perhaps because of&mdash;her
  great wealth, she had found a refuge, though not a home, at Acol Court; she
  had been of course too young at the time to understand rightly the great
  conflict between the King&rsquo;s party and the Puritans, but had naturally
  embraced the cause&mdash;for which her father&rsquo;s life had been sacrificed&mdash;blindly,
  like a child of instinct, not like a woman of thought.</p>
  <p>Her guardian and Mistress de Chavasse stood for that faction of Roundheads
  at which her father and all her relatives had sneered even while they were
  being conquered and oppressed by them. She disliked them both from the first;
  and chafed at the parsimonious habits of the house, which stood in such glaring
  contrast to the easy lavishness of her own luxurious home.</p>
  <p>Fortunately for her, her guardian avoided rather than sought her company.
  She met him at meals and scarcely more often than that, and though she often
  heard his voice about the house, usually raised in anger or impatience, he
  was invariably silent and taciturn when she was present.</p>
  <p>The presence of Richard Lambert, his humble devotion, his whole-hearted
  sympathy and the occasional moments of conversation which she had with him
  were the only bright moments in her dull life at the Court: and there is
  small doubt but that the friendship and trust which characterized her feelings
  towards him would soon have ripened into more passionate love, but for the
  advent into her life of the mysterious hero, who by his personality, his
  strange, secretive ways, his talk of patriotism and liberty, at once took
  complete possession of her girlish imagination.</p>
  <p>She was perhaps just too young when she met Lambert; she had not yet reached
  that dangerous threshold when girlhood looks from out obscure ignorance into
  the glaring knowledge of womanhood. She was a child when Lambert showed his
  love for her by a thousand little simple acts of devotion and by the mute
  adoration expressed in his eyes. Lambert drew her towards the threshold by
  his passionate love, and held her back within the refuge of innocent girlhood
  by the sincerity and exaltation of his worship.</p>
  <p>With the first word of vehement, unreasoning passion, the mysterious prince
  dragged the girl over that threshold into womanhood. He gave her no time
  to think, no time to analyze her feelings; he rushed her into a torrent of
  ardor and of excitement in which she never could pause in order to draw breath.</p>
  <p>To-night she had promised to marry him secretly&mdash;to surrender herself
  body and soul to this man whom she hardly knew, whom she had never really
  seen; she felt neither joy nor remorse, only a strange sense of agitation,
  an unnatural and morbid impatience to see the end of the next few days of
  suspense.</p>
  <p>For the first time since she had come to Acol, and encountered the kindly
  sympathy of Richard Lambert, she felt bitterly angered against him when,
  having parted from the prince at the door of the pavilion, she turned, to
  walk back towards the house and came face to face with the young man.</p>
  <p>A narrow path led through the trees, from the ha-ha to the gate, and Richard
  Lambert was apparently walking along aimlessly, in the direction of the pavilion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I came hoping to meet your ladyship and to escort you home. The night
  seems very dark,&rdquo; he explained simply in answer to a sudden, haughty
  stiffening of her young figure, which he could not help but notice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was taking a stroll in the park,&rdquo; she rejoined coldly, &ldquo;the
  evening is sweet and balmy but ... I have no need of escort, Master Lambert
  ... I thank you.... It is late and I would wish to go indoors alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is indeed late, gracious lady,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;and
  the park is lonely at night ... will you not allow me to walk beside you
  as far as the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But somehow his insistence, his very gentleness struck a jarring note, for
  which she herself could not have accounted. Was it the contrast between two
  men, which unaccountably sent a thrill of disappointment, almost of apprehension,
  through her heart?</p>
  <p>She was angry with Lambert, bitterly angry because he was kind and gentle
  and long-suffering, whilst the other was violent, even brutal at times.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must repeat, master, that I have no need of your escort,&rdquo; she
  said haughtily, &ldquo;I have no fear of marauders, nor yet of prowling beasts.
  And for the future I should be grateful to you,&rdquo; she added, conscious
  of her own cruelty, determined nevertheless to be remorselessly cruel, &ldquo;if
  you were to cease that system which you have adopted of late&mdash;that of
  spying on my movements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spying?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The word had struck him in the face like a blow. And she, womanlike, with
  that strange, impulsive temperament of hers, was not at all sorry that she
  had hurt him. Yet surely he had done her no wrong, save by being so different
  from the other man, and by seeming to belittle that other in her sight, against
  her will and his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am grieved, believe me,&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;if I seem
  unkind ... but you must see for yourself, good master, that we cannot go
  on as we are doing now.... Whenever I go out, you follow me ... when I return
  I find you waiting for me.... I have endeavored to think kindly of your actions,
  but if you value my friendship, as you say you do, you will let me go my
  way in peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! I humbly beg your ladyship&rsquo;s gracious forgiveness,&rdquo; he
  said; &ldquo;if I have transgressed, it is because I am blind to all save
  your ladyship&rsquo;s future happiness, and at times the thought of that
  adventurer is more than I can bear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do yourself no good, Master Lambert, by talking thus to me of
  the man I love and honor beyond all things in this world. You are blind and
  see not things as they are: blind to the merits of one who is as infinitely
  above you as the stars. But nathless I waste my breath again.... I have no
  power to convince you of the grievous error which you commit. But if you
  cared for me, as you say you do ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I cared!&rdquo; he murmured, with a pathetic emphasis on that
  little word &ldquo;if.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As a friend I mean,&rdquo; she rejoined still cold, still cruel,
  still womanlike in that strange, inexplicable desire to wound the man who
  loved her. &ldquo;If you care for me as a friend, you will not throw yourself
  any more in the way of my happiness. Now you may escort me home, an you wish.
  This is the last time that I shall speak to you as a friend, in response
  to your petty attacks on the man whom I love. Henceforth you must chose &rsquo;twixt
  his friendship and my enmity!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And without vouchsafing him another word or look, she gathered her cloak
  more closely about her, and walked rapidly away along the narrow path.</p>
  <p>He followed with head bent, meditating, wondering! Wondering!</p>

  An Idea</b></h2>
  <p>The triumph was complete. But of a truth the game was waxing dangerous.</p>
  <p>Lady Sue Aldmarshe had promised to marry her prince. She would keep her
  word, of that Sir Marmaduke was firmly convinced. But there would of necessity
  be two or three days delay and every hour added to the terrors, the certainty
  of discovery.</p>
  <p>There was a watch-dog at Sue&rsquo;s heels, stern, alert, unyielding. Richard
  Lambert was probing the secret of the mysterious prince, with the unerring
  eye of the disappointed lover.</p>
  <p>The meeting to-night had been terribly dangerous. Sir Marmaduke knew that
  Lambert was lurking somewhere in the park.</p>
  <p>At present even the remotest inkling of the truth must still be far from
  the young man&rsquo;s mind. The whole scheme was so strange, so daring, so
  foreign to the simple ideas of the Quaker-bred lad, that its very boldness
  had defied suspicion. But the slightest mischance now, a meeting at the door
  of the pavilion, an altercation&mdash;face to face, eye to eye&mdash;and
  Richard Lambert would be on the alert. His hatred would not be so blind,
  nor yet so clumsy, as that of his brother, the blacksmith. There is no spy
  so keen in all the world as a jealous lover.</p>
  <p>This had been the prince&rsquo;s first meeting with Sue, since that memorable
  day when the secret of their clandestine love became known to Lambert. Sir
  Marmaduke knew well that it had been fraught with danger; that every future
  meeting would wax more and more perilous still, and that the secret marriage
  itself, however carefully and secretively planned, would hardly escape the
  prying eyes of the young man.</p>
  <p>The unmasking of Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans before
  Sue had become legally his wife was a possibility which Sir Marmaduke dared
  not even think of, lest the very thought should drive him mad. Once she was
  his wife! ... well, let her look to herself.... The marriage tie would be
  a binding one, he would see to that, and her fortune should be his, even
  though he had won her by a lie.</p>
  <p>He had staked his very existence on the success of his scheme. Lady Sue&rsquo;s
  fortune was the one aim of his life, for it he had worked and striven, and
  lied: he would not even contemplate a future without it, now that his plans
  had brought him so near the goal.</p>
  <p>He had one faithful ally, though not a powerful one, in Editha, who, lured
  by some vague promises of his, desperate too, as regarded her own future,
  had chosen to throw in her lot whole-heartedly with his.</p>
  <p>He was closeted with her on the following day, in the tiny withdrawing-room
  which leads out of the hall at Acol Court. When he had stolen into the house
  in the small hours of the morning he had seen Richard Lambert leaning out
  of one of the windows which gave upon the park.</p>
  <p>It seemed as if the young man must have seen him when he skirted the house,
  for though there was no moonlight, the summer&rsquo;s night was singularly
  clear. That Lambert had been on the watch&mdash;spying, as Sir Marmaduke
  said with a bitter oath of rage&mdash;was beyond a doubt.</p>
  <p>Editha too was uneasy; she thought that Lambert had purposely avoided her
  the whole morning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I lingered in the garden for as long as I could,&rdquo; she said
  to her brother-in-law, watching with keen anxiety his restless movements
  to and fro in the narrow room, &ldquo;I thought Lambert would keep within
  doors if he saw me about. He did not actually see you, Marmaduke, did he?&rdquo; she
  queried with ever-growing disquietude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Not face to face,&rdquo; he replied curtly. &ldquo;I contrived
  to avoid him in the park, and kept well within the shadows, when I saw him
  spying through the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse him!&rdquo; he added with savage fury, &ldquo;curse him, for
  a meddlesome, spying cur!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The whole thing is becoming vastly dangerous,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet it must last for another few weeks at least....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know ... and Lambert is a desperate enemy: he dogs Sue&rsquo;s
  footsteps, he will come upon you one day when you are alone, or with her
  ... he will provoke a quarrel....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;I know ...&rdquo; he retorted impatiently, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
  no use recapitulating the many evil contingencies that might occur.... I
  know that Lambert is dangerous ... damn him! ... Would to God I could be
  rid of him ... somehow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can dismiss him,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;pay him his wages
  and send him about his business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What were the use? He would remain in the village&mdash;in his brother&rsquo;s
  cottage mayhap ... with more time on his hands for his spying work.... He
  would dog the wench&rsquo;s steps more jealously than ever.... No! no!&rdquo; he
  added, whilst he cast a quick, furtive look at her&mdash;a look which somehow
  caused her to shiver with apprehension more deadly than heretofore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I want,&rdquo; he said significantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
  to be done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must think,&rdquo; he rejoined harshly. &ldquo;But we must get
  that love-sick youth out of the way ... him and his airs of Providence in
  disguise.... Something must be done to part him from the wench effectually
  and completely ... something that would force him to quit this neighborhood
  ... forever, if possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She did not reply immediately, but fixed her large, dark eyes upon him,
  silently for a while, then she murmured:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I only knew!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Knew what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I could trust you, Marmaduke!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He laughed, a harsh, cruel laugh which grated upon her ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We know too much of one another, my dear Editha, not to trust each
  other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My whole future depends on you. I am penniless. If you marry Sue....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can provide for you,&rdquo; he interrupted roughly. &ldquo;What
  can I do now? My penury is worse than yours. So, my dear, if you have a plan
  to propound for the furtherance of my schemes, I pray you do not let your
  fear of the future prevent you from lending me a helping hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A thought crossed my mind,&rdquo; she said eagerly, &ldquo;the thought
  of something which would effectually force Richard Lambert to quit this neighborhood
  for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What were that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Disgrace?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Aye! you are right. Something
  mean ... paltry ... despicable ... something that would make her gracious
  ladyship turn away from him in disgust ... and would force him to go away
  from here ... for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked at her closely, scrutinizing her face, trying to read her thoughts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A thought crossed your mind,&rdquo; he demanded peremptorily. &ldquo;What
  is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The house in London,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not afraid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said with a careless shrug of the shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Protector&rsquo;s spies are keen,&rdquo; he urged, eager to test
  her courage, her desire to help him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll scarce remember me after two years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hm! Their memory is keen ... and the new laws doubly severe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be cautious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can you let your usual clients know? They are dispersed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no! My Lord Walterton is as keen as ever and Sir James Overbury
  would brave the devil for a night at hazard. A message to them and we&rsquo;ll
  have a crowd every night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well thought on, Editha,&rdquo; he said approvingly. &ldquo;But
  we must not delay. Will you go to London to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An you approve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! you can take the Dover coach and be in town by nightfall. Then
  write your letters to my Lord Walterton and Sir James Overbury. Get a serving
  wench from Alverstone&rsquo;s in the Strand, and ask the gentlemen to bring
  their own men, for the sake of greater safety. They&rsquo;ll not refuse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Refuse?&rdquo; she said with a light laugh, &ldquo;oh, no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-day being Tuesday, you should have your first evening entertainment
  on Friday. Everything could be ready by then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well then, on Friday, I, too, will arrive in London, my dear
  Editha, escorted by my secretary, Master Richard Lambert, and together we
  will call and pay our respects at your charming house in Bath Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will do my share. You must do yours, Marmaduke. Endicott will help
  you: he is keen and clever. And if Lambert but takes a card in his hand ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! he will take the cards, mine oath on that! Do you but arrange
  it all with Endicott.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, Marmaduke, I entreat you,&rdquo; she urged now with sudden earnestness, &ldquo;I
  entreat you to beware of my Lord Protector&rsquo;s spies. Think of the consequences
  for me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; he said roughly, laughing that wicked, cruel laugh of
  his, which damped her eagerness, and struck chill terror into her heart, &ldquo;aye!
  the whipping-post for you, fair Editha, for keeping a gaming-house. What?
  Of a truth I need not urge you to be cautious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Probably at this moment she would have given worlds&mdash;had she possessed
  them&mdash;if she could but have dissociated herself from her brother-in-law&rsquo;s
  future altogether. Though she was an empty-headed, brainless kind of woman,
  she was not by nature a wicked one. Necessity had driven her into linking
  her fortunes with those of Sir Marmaduke. And he had been kind to her, when
  she was in deep distress: but for him she would probably have starved, for
  her beauty had gone and her career as an actress had been, for some inexplicable
  reason, quite suddenly cut short, whilst a police raid on the gaming-house
  over which she presided had very nearly landed her in a convict&rsquo;s cell.</p>
  <p>She had escaped severe punishment then, chiefly because Cromwell&rsquo;s
  laws against gambling were not so rigorous at the time as they had since
  become, also because she was able to plead ignorance of them, and because
  of the status of first offense.</p>
  <p>Therefore she knew quite well what she risked through the scheme which she
  had so boldly propounded to Sir Marmaduke. Dire disgrace and infamy, if my
  Lord Protector&rsquo;s spies once more came upon the gamesters in her house&mdash;unawares.</p>
  <p>Utter social ruin and worse! Yet she risked it all, in order to help him.
  She did not love him, nor had she any hopes that he would of his own free
  will do more than give her a bare pittance for her needs once he had secured
  Lady Sue&rsquo;s fortune; but she was shrewd enough to reckon that the more
  completely she was mixed up in his nefarious projects, the more absolutely
  forced would he be to accede to her demands later on. The word blackmail
  had not been invented in those days, but the deed itself existed and what
  Editha had in her mind when she risked ostracism for Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s
  sake was something very akin to it.</p>
  <p>But he, in the meanwhile, had thrown off his dejection. He was full of eagerness,
  of anticipated triumph now.</p>
  <p>The rough idea which was to help him in his schemes had originated in Editha&rsquo;s
  brain, but already he had elaborated it; had seen in the plan a means not
  only of attaining his own ends with regard to Sue, but also of wreaking a
  pleasing vengeance on the man who was trying to frustrate him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you, be of good cheer, fair Editha,&rdquo; he said quite gaily. &ldquo;Your
  plan is good and sound, and meseems as if the wench&rsquo;s fortune were
  already within my grasp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Within our grasp, you mean, Marmaduke,&rdquo; she said significantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our grasp of course, gracious lady,&rdquo; he said with a marked
  sneer, which she affected to ignore. &ldquo;What is mine is yours. Am I not
  tied to the strings of your kirtle by lasting bonds of infinite gratitude?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will start to-morrow then. By chaise to Dover and thence by coach,&rdquo; she
  said coldly, taking no heed of his irony. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twere best you did
  not assume your romantic r&ocirc;le again until after your own voyage to
  London. You can give me some money I presume. I can do nothing with an empty
  purse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You shall have the whole contents of mine, gracious Editha,&rdquo; he
  said blandly, &ldquo;some ten pounds in all, until the happy day when I can
  place half a million at your feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  The House In London</b></h2>
  <p>It stood about midway down an unusually narrow by-street off the Strand.</p>
  <p>A tumble-down archway, leaning to one side like a lame hen, gave access
  to a dark passage, dank with moisture, whereon the door of the house gave
  some eighteen feet up on the left.</p>
  <p>The unpaved street, undrained and unutterably filthy, was ankle-deep in
  mud, even at the close of this hot August day. Down one side a long blank
  wall, stone-built and green with mildew, presented an unbroken frontage:
  on the other the row of houses with doors perpetually barred, and windows
  whereon dust and grit had formed effectual curtains against prying eyes,
  added to the sense of loneliness, of insecurity, of unknown dangers lurking
  behind that crippled archway, or beneath the shadows of the projecting eaves,
  whence the perpetual drip-drip of soot water came as a note of melancholy
  desolation.</p>
  <p>From all the houses the plaster was peeling off in many places, a prey to
  the inclemencies of London winters; all presented gray facades, with an air
  of eeriness about their few windows, flush with the outside wall&mdash;at
  one time painted white, no doubt, but now of uniform dinginess with the rest
  of the plaster work.</p>
  <p>There was a grim hint about the whole street of secret meetings, and of
  unavowable deeds done under cover of isolation and of darkness, whilst the
  great crooked mouth of the archway disclosing the blackness and gloom of
  the passage beyond, suggested the lair of human wild beasts who only went
  about in the night.</p>
  <p>As a rule but few passers-by availed themselves of this short and narrow
  cut down to the river-side. Nathless, the unarmed citizen was scared by these
  dank and dreary shadows, whilst the city watchman, mindful of his own safety,
  was wont to pass the mean street by.</p>
  <p>Only my Lord Protector&rsquo;s new police-patrol fresh to its onerous task,
  solemnly marched down it once in twenty-four hours, keeping shoulder to shoulder,
  looking neither to right nor left, thankful when either issue was once more
  within sight.</p>
  <p>But in this same evening in August, 1657, it seemed as if quite a number
  of people had business in Bath Street off the Strand. At any rate this was
  specially noticeable after St. Mary&rsquo;s had struck the hour of nine,
  when several cloaked and hooded figures slipped, one after another, some
  singly, others in groups of two or three, into the shadow of the narrow lane.</p>
  <p>They all walked in silence, and did not greet one another as they passed;
  some cast from time to time furtive looks behind them; but every one of these
  evening prowlers seemed to have the same objective, for as soon as they reached
  the crippled archway, they disappeared within the gloom of its yawning mouth.</p>
  <p>Anon when the police-patrol had gone by and was lost in the gloom there
  where Bath Street debouches on the river bank, two of these heavily cloaked
  figures walked rapidly down from the Strand, and like the others slipped
  quickly under the archway, and made straight for the narrow door on the left
  of the passage.</p>
  <p>This door was provided with a heavy bronze knocker, but strangely enough
  the newcomers did not avail themselves of its use, but rapped on the wooden
  panels with their knuckles, giving three successive raps at regular intervals.</p>
  <p>They were admitted almost immediately, the door seemingly opening of itself,
  and they quickly stepped across the threshold.</p>
  <p>Within the house was just as dark and gloomy as it was without, and as the
  two visitors entered, a voice came from out the shadows, and said, in a curious
  monotone and with strange irrelevance:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The hour is late!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;twill be later still,&rdquo; replied one of the newcomers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet the cuckoo hath not called,&rdquo; retorted the voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor is the ferret on the prowl,&rdquo; was the enigmatic reply. Whereupon
  the voice speaking in more natural tones added sententiously:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two flights of steps, and &rsquo;ware the seventeenth step on the
  first flight. Door on the left, two raps, then three.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, friend,&rdquo; rejoined one of the newcomers, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
  pleasant to feel that so faithful a watch guards the entrance of this palace
  of pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thereupon the two visitors, who of a truth must have been guided either
  by instinct or by intimate knowledge of the place, for not a gleam of light
  illumined the entrance hall, groped their way to a flight of stone stairs
  which led in a steep curve to the upper floors of the house.</p>
  <p>A rickety banister which gave ominously under the slightest pressure helped
  to guide the visitors in this utter darkness: but obviously the warning uttered
  by that mysterious challenging voice below was not superfluous, for having
  carefully counted sixteen steps in an upward direction, the newcomers came
  to a halt, and feeling their way forward now with uttermost caution, their
  feet met a yawning hole, which had soon caused a serious accident to a stranger
  who had ventured thus far in ignorance of pitfalls.</p>
  <p>A grim laugh, echoed by a lighter one, showed that the visitors had encountered
  only what they had expected, and after this brief episode they continued
  their journey upwards with a firmer sense of security; a smoky oil lamp on
  the first floor landing guided their footsteps by casting a flickering light
  on the narrow stairway, whereon slime and filth crept unchecked through the
  broken crevices between the stones.</p>
  <p>But now as they advanced, the silence seemed more broken: a distinct hum
  as of many voices was soon perceptible, and anon a shrill laugh, followed
  by another more deep in tone, and echoed by others which presently died away
  in the distance.</p>
  <p>By the time the two men had reached the second floor landing these many
  noises had become more accentuated, also more distinct; still muffled and
  subdued as if proceeding from behind heavy doors, but nevertheless obvious
  as the voices of men and women in lively converse.</p>
  <p>The newcomers gave the distinctive raps prescribed by their first mentor,
  on the thick panels of a solid oak door on their left.</p>
  <p>The next moment the door itself was thrown open from within; a flood of
  light burst forth upon the gloomy landing from the room beyond, the babel
  of many voices became loud and clear, and as the two men stood for a moment
  beneath the lintel a veritable chorus of many exclamations greeted them from
  every side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Walterton! begad!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Overbury, too!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How late ye come!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We thought ye&rsquo;d fallen a victim to Noll&rsquo;s myrmidons!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was of a truth a gay and merry company that stood, and moved, chatted
  and laughed, within the narrow confines of that small second-floor room in
  the gloomy house in Bath Street.</p>
  <p>The walls themselves were dingy and bare, washed down with some grayish
  color, which had long since been defaced by the grime and dust of London.
  Thick curtains of a nondescript hue fell in straight folds before each window,
  and facing these there was another door&mdash;double paneled&mdash;which
  apparently led to an inner room.</p>
  <p>But the place itself was brilliantly illuminated with many wax candles set
  in chandeliers. These stood on the several small tables which were dotted
  about the room.</p>
  <p>These tables&mdash;covered with green baize, and a number of chairs of various
  shapes and doubtful solidity were the only furniture of the room, but in
  an arched recess in the wall a plaster figure holding a cornucopia, from
  whence fell in thick profusion the plaster presentments of the fruits of
  this earth, stood on an elevated pedestal, which had been draped with crimson
  velvet.</p>
  <p>The goddess of Fortune, with a broken nose and a paucity of fingers, dominated
  the brilliant assembly, from the height of her crimson throne. Her head had
  been crowned with a tall peaked modish beaver hat, from which a purple feather
  rakishly swept over the goddess&rsquo;s left ear. An ardent devotee had deposited
  a copper coin in her extended, thumbless hand, whilst another had fixed a
  row of candle stumps at her feet.</p>
  <p>There was nothing visible in this brilliantly lighted room of the sober
  modes to which the eye of late had become so accustomed. Silken doublets
  of bright and even garish colors stood out in bold contrast against the gray
  monotone of the walls and hangings. Fantastic buttons, tags and laces, gorgeously
  embroidered cuffs and collars edged with priceless Mechlin or d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on,
  bunches of ribands at knee and wrists, full periwigs and over-wide boot-hose
  tops were everywhere to be seen, whilst the clink of swords against the wooden
  boards and frequent volleys of loudly spoken French oaths, testified to the
  absence of those Puritanic fashions and customs which had become the general
  rule even in London.</p>
  <p>Some of the company sat in groups round the green-topped tables whereon
  cards or dice and heaps of gold and smaller coins lay in profusion. Others
  stood about watching the games or chatting to one another. Mostly men they
  were, some old, some young&mdash;but there were women too, women in showy
  kirtles, with bare shoulders showing well above the colverteen kerchief and
  faces wherein every line had been obliterated by plentiful daubs of cosmetics.
  They moved about the room from table to table, laughing, talking, making
  comments on the games as these proceeded.</p>
  <p>The men apparently were all intent&mdash;either as actual participants or
  merely as spectators&mdash;upon a form of amusement which His Highness the
  Lord Protector had condemned as wanton and contrary to law.</p>
  <p>The newcomers soon divested themselves of their immense dark cloaks, and
  they, too, appeared in showy apparel of silk and satin, with tiny bows of
  ribands at the ends of the long curls which fell both sides of their faces,
  and with enormous frills of lace inside the turned-over tops of their boots.</p>
  <p>Lord Walterton quite straddled in his gait, so wide were his boot tops,
  and there was an extraordinary maze of tags and ribands round the edge of
  Sir James Overbury&rsquo;s breeches.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Make your game, gentlemen, make your game,&rdquo; said the latter
  as he advanced further into the room. And his tired, sleepy eyes brightened
  at sight of the several tables covered with cards and dice, the guttering
  candles, the mountains of gold and small coin scattered on the green baize
  tops.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Par Dieu! but &rsquo;tis a sight worth seeing after the ugly sour
  faces one meets in town these days!&rdquo; he added, gleefully rubbing his
  beringed hands one against the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But where is our gracious hostess?&rdquo; added Lord Walterton, a
  melancholy-looking young man with pale-colored eyes and lashes, and a narrow
  chest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are thrice welcome, my lord!&rdquo; said Editha de Chavasse,
  whose elegant figure now detached itself from amongst her guests.</p>
  <p>She looked very handsome in her silken kirtle of a brilliant greenish hue,
  lace primer, and high-heeled shoes&mdash;relics of her theatrical days; her
  head was adorned with the bunches of false curls which the modish hairdressers
  were trying to introduce. The plentiful use of cosmetics had obliterated
  the ravages of time and imparted a youthful appearance to her face, whilst
  excitement not unmixed with apprehension lent a bright glitter to her dark
  eyes.</p>
  <p>Lord Walterton and Sir James Overbury lightly touched with their lips the
  hand which she extended to them. Their bow, too, was slight, though they
  tossed their curls as they bent their heads in the most approved French fashion.
  But there was a distinct note of insolence, not altogether unmixed with irony,
  in the freedom with which they had greeted her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I met de Chavasse in town to-day,&rdquo; said Lord Walterton, over
  his shoulder before he mixed with the crowd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! he will be here to-night,&rdquo; she rejoined. Sir James Overbury
  also made a casual remark, but it was evident that the intention and purpose
  of these gay gentlemen was not the courteous entertainment of their hostess.
  Like so many men of all times and all nations in this world, they were ready
  enough to enjoy what she provided for them&mdash;the illicit pastime which
  they could not get elsewhere&mdash;but they despised her for giving it them,
  and cared naught for the heavy risks she ran in keeping up this house for
  their pleasure.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  A Game Of Primero</b></h2>
  <p>At a table in the immediate center of the room a rotund gentleman in doublet
  and breeches of cinnamon brown taffeta and voluminous lace cuffs at the wrists
  was presiding over a game of Spanish primero.</p>
  <p>A simple game enough, not difficult of comprehension, yet vastly exciting,
  if one may form a judgment of its qualities through watching the faces of
  the players.</p>
  <p>The rotund gentleman dealt a card face downwards to each of his opponents,
  who then looked at their cards and staked on them, by pushing little piles
  of gold or silver forward.</p>
  <p>Then the dealer turned up his own card, and gave the amount of the respective
  stakes to those players whose cards were of higher value than his own, whilst
  sweeping all other moneys to swell his own pile.</p>
  <p>A simple means, forsooth, of getting rid of any superfluity of cash.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Art winning, Endicott?&rdquo; queried Lord Walterton as, he stood
  over the other man, looking down on the game.</p>
  <p>Endicott shrugged his fat shoulders, and gave an enigmatic chuckle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pay King and Ace only,&rdquo; he called out imperturbably, as he
  turned up a Queen.</p>
  <p>Most of the stakes came to swell his own pile, but he passed a handful of
  gold to a hollow-eyed youth who sat immediately opposite to him, and who
  clutched at the money with an eager, trembling grasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have all the luck to-night, Segrave,&rdquo; he said with an oily
  smile directed at the winner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Make your game, gentlemen,&rdquo; he added almost directly, as he
  once more began to deal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pay knave upwards!&rdquo; he declared, turning up the ten of clubs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mine is the ten of hearts,&rdquo; quoth one of the players.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ties pay the bank,&rdquo; quoth Endicott imperturbably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mine is a queen,&rdquo; said Segrave in a hollow tone of voice.</p>
  <p>Endicott with a comprehensive oath threw the entire pack of cards into a
  distant corner of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A fresh pack, mistress!&rdquo; he shouted peremptorily.</p>
  <p>Then as an overdressed, florid woman, with high bullhead fringe and old-fashioned
  Spanish farthingale, quickly obeyed his behests, he said with a coarse laugh:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fresh cards may break Master Segrave&rsquo;s luck and improve yours,
  Sir Michael.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before this round begins,&rdquo; said Sir James Overbury who was
  standing close behind Lord Walterton, also watching the game, &ldquo;I will
  bet you, Walterton, that Segrave wins again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Done with you,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll back
  mine own opinion by taking a hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The florid woman brought him a chair, and he sat down at the table, as Endicott
  once more began to deal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five pounds that Segrave wins,&rdquo; said Overbury.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A queen,&rdquo; said Endicott, turning up his card. &ldquo;I pay
  king and ace only.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Everyone had to pay the bank, for all turned up low cards; Segrave alone
  had not yet turned up his.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! what is your card, Master Segrave?&rdquo; queried Lord Walterton
  lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An ace!&rdquo; said Segrave simply, displaying the ace of hearts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No good betting against the luck,&rdquo; said young Walterton lightly,
  as he handed five sovereigns over to his friend, &ldquo;moreover it spoils
  my system.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye play primero on a system!&rdquo; quoth Sir Michael Isherwood in
  deep amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; replied the young man. &ldquo;I have played on it for
  years ... and it is infallible, &rsquo;pon my honor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In the meanwhile the doors leading to the second room had been thrown open;
  serving men and women advanced carrying trays on which were displayed glasses
  and bottles filled with Rhenish wine and Spanish canary and muscadel, also
  buttered ale and mead and hypocras for the ladies.</p>
  <p>Editha did not occupy herself with serving but the florid woman was most
  attentive to the guests. She darted in and out between the tables, managing
  her unwieldy farthingale with amazing skill. She poured out the wines, and
  offered tarts and dishes of anchovies and of cheese, also strange steaming
  beverages lately imported into England called coffee and chocolate.</p>
  <p>The women liked the latter, and supped it out of mugs, with many little
  cries of astonishment and appreciation of its sugariness.</p>
  <p>The men drank heavily, chiefly of the heady Spanish wines; they ate the
  anchovies and cheese with their fingers, and continually called for more
  refreshments.</p>
  <p>Play was of necessity interrupted. Groups of people eating and drinking
  congregated round the tables. The men mostly discussed various phases of
  the game; there was so little else for idlers to talk about these days. No
  comedies or other diversions, neither cock-fighting nor bear-baiting, and
  abuse of my Lord Protector and his rigorous disciplinarian laws had already
  become stale.</p>
  <p>The women talked dress and coiffure, the new puffs, the fanciful pinners.</p>
  <p>But at the center table Segrave still sat, refusing all refreshment, waiting
  with obvious impatience for the ending of this unwelcome interval. When first
  he found himself isolated in the crowd, he had counted over with febrile
  eagerness the money which lay in a substantial heap before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Saved!&rdquo; he muttered between his teeth, speaking to himself
  like one who is dreaming, &ldquo;saved! Thank God! ... Two hundred and fifty
  pounds ... only another fifty and I&rsquo;ll never touch these cursed cards
  again ... only another fifty....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He buried his face in his hands; the moisture stood out in heavy drops on
  his forehead. He looked all round him with ever-growing impatience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God! why don&rsquo;t they come back! ... Another fifty pounds
  ... and I can put the money back ... before it has been missed.... Oh! why
  don&rsquo;t they come back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Quite a tragedy expressed in those few muttered words, in the trembling
  hands, the damp forehead. Money taken from an unsuspecting parent, guardian
  or master, which? What matter? A tragedy of ordinary occurrence even in those
  days when social inequalities were being abolished by act of Parliament.</p>
  <p>In the meanwhile Lord Walterton, halting of speech, insecure of foothold,
  after his third bumper of heady sack, was explaining to Sir Michael Isherwood
  the mysteries of his system for playing the noble game of primero.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is sure to break the bank in time,&rdquo; he said confidently, &ldquo;I
  am for going to Paris where play runs high, and need not be carried on in
  this hole and corner fashion to suit cursed Puritanical ideas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me your secret, Walterton,&rdquo; urged worthy Sir Michael,
  whose broad Shropshire acres were heavily mortgaged, after the rapine and
  pillage of civil war.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! I can but tell you part, my friend,&rdquo; rejoined the other, &ldquo;yet &rsquo;tis
  passing simple. You begin with one golden guinea ... and lose it ... then
  you put up two and lose again....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Passing simple,&rdquo; assented Sir Michael ironically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But after that you put up four guineas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And lose it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yea! yea! mayhap you lose it ... but then you put up eight guineas
  ... and win. Whereupon you are just as you were before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with a somewhat unsteady hand the young man raised a bumper to his lips,
  whilst eying Sir Michael with the shifty and inquiring eye peculiar to the
  intoxicated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meseems that if you but abstain from playing altogether,&rdquo; quoth
  Sir Michael impatiently, &ldquo;the result would still be the same.... And
  suppose you lose the eight guineas, what then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! &rsquo;tis vastly simple&mdash;you put up sixteen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But if you lose that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put up thirty-two....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But if you have not thirty-two guineas to put up?&rdquo; urged Sir
  Michael, who was obstinate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! then, my friend,&rdquo; said Lord Walterton with a laugh which
  soon broke into an ominous hiccough, &ldquo;ye must not in that case play
  upon my system.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well said, my lord,&rdquo; here interposed Endicott, who had most
  moderately partaken of a cup of hypocras, and whose eye and hand were as
  steady as heretofore. &ldquo;Well said, pardi! ... My old friend the Marquis
  of Swarthmore used oft to say in the good old days of Goring&rsquo;s Club,
  that &rsquo;twas better to lose on a system, than to play on no system at
  all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A smart cavalier, old Swarthmore,&rdquo; assented Sir Michael gruffly, &ldquo;and
  nathless, a true friend to you, Endicott,&rdquo; he added significantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another deal, Master Endicott,&rdquo; said Segrave, who for the last
  quarter of an hour had vainly tried to engage the bank-holder&rsquo;s attention.</p>
  <p>Nor was Lord Walterton averse to this. The more the wine got into his head,
  the more unsteady his hand became, the more strong was his desire to woo
  the goddess whose broken-nosed image seemed to be luring him to fortune.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are right, Master Segrave,&rdquo; he said thickly, &ldquo;we
  are wasting valuable time. Who knows but what old Noll&rsquo;s police-patrol
  is lurking in this cutthroat alley? ... Endicott, take the bank again....
  I&rsquo;ll swear I&rsquo;ll ruin ye ere the moon&mdash;which I do not see&mdash;disappears
  down the horizon. Sir Michael, try my system.... Overbury, art a laggard?
  ... Let us laugh and be merry&mdash;to-morrow is the Jewish Sabbath&mdash;and
  after that Puritanic Sunday ... after which mayhap, we&rsquo;ll all go to
  hell, driven thither by my Lord Protector. Wench, another bumper ... canary,
  sack or muscadel ... no thin Rhenish wine shall e&rsquo;er defile this throat!
  Gentlemen, take your places.... Mistress Endicott, can none of these wenches
  discourse sweet music whilst we do homage to the goddess of Fortune? ...
  To the tables ... to the tables, gentlemen ... here&rsquo;s to King Charles,
  whom may God protect ... and all in defiance of my Lord Protector!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  A Conflict</b></h2>
  <p>In the hubbub which immediately followed Lord Walterton&rsquo;s tirade,
  Editha de Chavasse beckoned to the florid woman&mdash;who seemed to be her
  henchwoman&mdash;and drew her aside to a distant corner of the room, where
  there were no tables nigh and where the now subdued hum of the voices, mingling
  with the sound of music on virginal and stringed instruments, made a murmuring
  noise which effectually drowned the talk between the two women.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you arranged everything, Mistress Endicott?&rdquo; asked Editha,
  speaking in a whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything, mistress,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Endicott understands?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; said the woman, with perceptible hesitation, &ldquo;but
  ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What ails you, mistress?&rdquo; asked Editha haughtily, noting the
  hesitation, and frowning with impatience thereat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My husband thinks the game too dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was not aware,&rdquo; retorted Mistress de Chavasse dryly, &ldquo;that
  I had desired Master Endicott&rsquo;s opinion on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayhap not,&rdquo; rejoined the other, equally dryly, &ldquo;but
  you did desire his help in the matter ... and he seems unmindful to give
  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have explained ... the game is too dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or the payment insufficient?&rdquo; sneered Editha. &ldquo;Which
  is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both, mayhap,&rdquo; assented Mistress Endicott with a careless shrug
  of her fat shoulders, &ldquo;the risks are very great. To-night especially....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why especially to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because ever since you have been away from it, this house&mdash;though
  we did our best to make it seem deserted&mdash;hath been watched&mdash;of
  that I feel very sure.... My Lord Protector&rsquo;s watchmen have a suspicion
  of our ... our evening entertainments ... and I doubt not but that they desire
  to see for themselves how our guests enjoy themselves these nights.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; rejoined Editha lightly. &ldquo;What of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you know, we did not play for nigh on twelve months now.... Endicott
  thought it too dangerous ... and to-night ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She checked herself abruptly, for Editha had turned an angry face and flashing
  eyes upon her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night?&rdquo; said Mistress de Chavasse curtly, but peremptorily, &ldquo;what
  of to-night? ... I sent you orders from Thanet that I wished the house opened
  to-night ... Lord Walterton, Sir James Overbury and as many of our usual
  friends as were in the town, apprised that play would be in full progress....
  Meseems,&rdquo; she added, casting a searching look all round the room, &ldquo;that
  we have singularly few players.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was difficult,&rdquo; retorted the other with somewhat more diffidence
  in her tone than had characterized her speech before now. &ldquo;Young Squire
  Delamere committed suicide ... you remember him? ... and Lord Cooke killed
  Sir Humphrey Clinton in a duel after that fracas we had here, when the police-patrol
  well-nigh seized upon your person.... Squire Delamere&rsquo;s suicide and
  Sir Humphrey&rsquo;s death caused much unpleasant talk. And old Mistress
  Delamere, the mother, hath I fear me, still a watchful eye on us. She means
  to do us lasting mischief.... It had been wiser to tarry yet awhile.... Twelve
  months is not sufficient for throwing the dust of ages over us and our doings....
  That is my husband&rsquo;s opinion and also mine.... A scandal such as you
  propose to have to-night, will bring the Protector&rsquo;s spies about our
  ears ... his police too, mayhap ... and then Heaven help us all, mistress
  ... for you, in the country, cannot conceive how rigorously are the laws
  enforced now against gambling, betting, swearing or any other form of innocent
  amusement.... Why! two wenches were whipped at the post by the public hangman
  only last week, because forsooth they were betting on the winner amongst
  themselves, whilst watching a bout of pell-mell.... And you know that John
  Howthill stood in the pillory for two hours and had both his hands bored
  through with a hot iron for allowing gambling inside his coffeehouse. ...
  And so, mistress, you will perceive that I am speaking but in your own interests....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Editha, who had listened to the long tirade with marked impatience, here
  interrupted the voluble lady, with harsh command.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I crave your pardon, mistress,&rdquo; she said peremptorily. &ldquo;My
  interests pre-eminently consist in being obeyed by those whom I pay for doing
  my behests. Now you and your worthy husband live here rent free and derive
  a benefit of ten pounds every time our guests assemble.... Well! in return
  for that, I make use of you and your names, in case of any unpleasantness
  with the vigilance patrol ... or in case of a scandal which might reach my
  Lord Protector&rsquo;s ears.... Up to this time your positions here have
  been a sinecure.... I even bore the brunt of the last fracas whilst you remained
  practically scathless.... But to-night, I own it, there may be some risks
  ... but of a truth you have been well paid to take them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But if we refuse to take the risks,&rdquo; retorted the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you refuse, mistress,&rdquo; said Editha with a careless shrug
  of the shoulders, &ldquo;you and your worthy lord go back to the gutter where
  I picked you up ... and within three months of that time, I should doubtless
  have the satisfaction of seeing you both at the whipping-post, for of a truth
  you would be driven to stealing or some other equally unavowable means of
  livelihood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We could send <i>you </i>there,&rdquo; said Mistress Endicott, striving
  to suppress her own rising fury, &ldquo;if we but said the word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! you would not be believed, mistress ... but even so, I do not
  perceive how my social ruin would benefit you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since we are doomed anyhow ... after this night&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; said
  the woman sullenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! but why should you take so gloomy a view of the situation? ...
  My Lord Protector hath forgot our existence by now, believe me ... and of
  a surety his patrol hath not yet knocked at our door.... And methinks, mistress,&rdquo; added
  Editha significantly, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis not in <i>your</i> interest to quarrel
  with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have no wish to quarrel with you,&rdquo; quoth Mistress Endicott,
  who apparently had come to the end of her resistance, and no doubt had known
  all along that her fortunes were too much bound up with those of Mistress
  de Chavasse to allow of a rupture between them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then everything is vastly satisfactory,&rdquo; said Editha with forced
  gayety. &ldquo;I rely on you, mistress, and on Endicott&rsquo;s undoubted
  talents to bring this last matter to a successful issue to-night. ... Remember,
  mistress ... I rely on you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Perhaps Mistress Endicott would have liked to prolong the argument. As a
  matter of fact, neither she nor her husband counted the risks of a midnight
  fracas of great moment to themselves: they had so very little to lose. A
  precarious existence based on illicit deeds of all sorts had rendered them
  hard and reckless.</p>
  <p>All they wished was to be well paid for the risks they ran; neither of them
  was wholly unacquainted with the pillory, and it held no great terrors for
  them. There were so many unavowable pleasures these days, which required
  a human cloak to cover the identity of the real transgressor, that people
  like Master and Mistress Endicott prospered vastly.</p>
  <p>The case of Mistress de Chavasse&rsquo;s London house wherein the ex-actress
  had some few years ago established a gaming club, together with its various
  emoluments attached thereunto, suited the Endicotts&rsquo; requirements to
  perfection: but the woman desired an increase of payment for the special
  risk she would run to-night, and was sorely vexed that she could not succeed
  in intimidating Editha with threats of vigilance-patrol and whipping-posts.</p>
  <p>Mistress de Chavasse knew full well that the Endicotts did not intend to
  quarrel with her, and having threatened rupture unless her commands were
  obeyed, she had no wish to argue the matter further with her henchwoman.</p>
  <p>At that moment, too, there came the sound of significant and methodical
  rappings at the door. Editha, who had persistently throughout her discussion
  with Mistress Endicott, kept one ear open for that sound, heard it even through
  the buzz of talk. She made a scarcely visible gesture of the hand, bidding
  the other woman to follow her: that gesture was quickly followed by a look
  of command.</p>
  <p>Mistress Endicott presumably had finally made up her mind to obey. She shrugged
  her fat shoulders and followed Mistress de Chavasse as far as the center
  of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember that you are the hostess now,&rdquo; murmured Editha to
  her, as she herself went to the door and opened it.</p>
  <p>With an affected cry of surprise and pleasure she welcomed Sir Marmaduke
  de Chavasse, who was standing on the threshold, prepared to enter and escorted
  by his young secretary, Master Richard Lambert.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  Rus In Urbe</b></h2>
  <p>One or two of the men looked up as de Chavasse entered, but no one took
  much notice of him.</p>
  <p>Most of those present remembered him from the past few years when still
  with pockets well filled through having forestalled Lady Sue&rsquo;s maintenance
  money, he was an habitual frequenter of some of the smart secret clubs in
  town; but here, just the same as elsewhere, Sir Marmaduke was not a popular
  man, and many there were who had unpleasant recollections of his surly temper
  and uncouth ways, whenever fickle Fortune happened not to favor him.</p>
  <p>Even now, he looked sullen and disagreeable as, having exchanged a significant
  glance with his sister-in-law, he gave a comprehensive nod to the assembled
  guests, which had nothing in it either of cordiality or of good-will. He
  touched Editha&rsquo;s finger tips with his lips, and then advanced into
  the room.</p>
  <p>Here he was met by Mistress Endicott, who had effectually thrown off the
  last vestige of annoyance and of rebellion, for she greeted the newcomer
  with marked good-humor and an encouraging smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is indeed a pleasure to see that Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse hath
  not forgot old friends,&rdquo; she said pleasantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was passing kind, gracious mistress,&rdquo; he responded, forcing
  himself to speak naturally and in agreeable tones, &ldquo;to remember an
  insignificant country bumpkin like myself ... and you see I have presumed
  on your lavish hospitality and brought my young friend, Master Richard Lambert,
  to whom you extended so gracious an invitation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned to Lambert, who a little dazed to find himself in such brilliant
  company, had somewhat timidly kept close to the heels of his employer. He
  thought Mistress Endicott vulgar and overdressed the moment he felt bold
  enough to raise his eyes to hers. But he chided himself immediately for thus
  daring to criticize his betters.</p>
  <p>His horizon so far had been very limited; only quite vaguely had he heard
  of town and Court life. The little cottage where dwelt the old Quakeress
  who had brought him and his brother up, and the tumble-down, dilapidated
  house of Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse were the only habitations in which he
  was intimate. The neighboring Kentish Squires, Sir Timothy Harrison, Squire
  Pyncheon and Sir John Boatfield, were the only presentations of &ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo; he
  had ever seen.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse had somewhat curtly given him orders the day before,
  that he was to accompany him to London, whither he himself had to go to consult
  his lawyer. Lambert had naturally obeyed, without murmur, but with vague
  trepidations at thought of this, his first journey into the great town.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke had been very kind, had given him a new suit of grogram, lined
  with flowered silk, which Lambert thought the richest garment he had ever
  seen. He was very loyal in his thoughts to his employer, bearing with the
  latter&rsquo;s violence and pandering to his fits of ill-humor for the sake
  of the home which Sir Marmaduke had provided for him.</p>
  <p>To Lambert&rsquo;s mind, Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s kindness to him was wholly
  gratuitous. His own position as secretary being but a sinecure, the young
  man readily attributed de Chavasse&rsquo;s interest in himself to innate
  goodness of heart, and desire to help the poor orphan lad.</p>
  <p>This estimate of his employer&rsquo;s character Richard Lambert had not
  felt any cause to modify. He continued to serve him faithfully, to look after
  his interests in and around Acol Court to the best of his ability; above
  all he continued to be whole-heartedly grateful. He was so absolutely conscious
  of the impassable social barrier which existed between himself and the rich
  daughter of the great Earl of Dover, that he never for a moment resented
  Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s sneers when they were directed against his obvious,
  growing love for Sue.</p>
  <p>Remember that he had no cause to suspect Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse of any
  nefarious projects or of any evil intentions with regard to himself, when
  he told him that together they would go this night to the house of an old
  friend, Mrs. Endicott, where they would derive much pleasure and entertainment.</p>
  <p>They had spent the previous night at the Swan Inn in Fleet Street and the
  day in visiting the beautiful sights of London, which caused the young lad
  from the country to open wide eyes in astonishment and pleasure.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke had been peculiarly gracious, even taking Richard with him
  to the Frenchman&rsquo;s house in Queen&rsquo;s Head Alley, where that curious
  beverage called coffee was dispensed and where several clever people met
  and discussed politics in a manner which was vastly interesting to the young
  man.</p>
  <p>Then when the evening began to draw in, and Lambert thought it high time
  to go to bed, for &rsquo;twas a pity to burn expensive candles longer than
  was necessary, Sir Marmaduke had astonished his secretary by telling him
  that he must now clean and tidy himself for they would proceed to the house
  of a great lady named Mistress Endicott&mdash;a friend of the ex-Queen Henrietta
  Maria and a lady of peculiar virtues and saintliness, who would give them
  vast and pleasing entertainment.</p>
  <p>Lambert was only too ready to obey. Enjoyment came naturally to him beneath
  his Quaker bringing-up: his youth, good-health and pure, naturally noble
  intellect, all craved companionship, with its attendant pleasures and joys.
  He himself could not afterwards have said exactly how he had pictured in
  his mind the saintly lady&mdash;friend of the unhappy Queen&mdash;whom he
  was to meet this night.</p>
  <p>Certainly Mistress Endicott, with her red face surmounted by masses of curls
  that were obviously false, since they did not match the rest of her hair,
  was not the ideal paragon of all the virtues, and when he was first made
  to greet her, a strange, unreasoning instinct seemed to draw him away from
  her, to warn him to fly from this noisy company, from the sight of those
  many faces, all unnaturally flushed, and from the sounds of those strange
  oaths which greeted his ears from every side.</p>
  <p>A great wave of thankfulness came over him that, his gracious lady&mdash;innocent,
  tender, beautiful Lady Sue, had not come to London with her guardian. Whilst
  he gazed on the marvels of Westminster Hall and of old Saint Paul&rsquo;s
  he had longed that she should be near him, so that he might watch the brilliance
  of her eyes, and the glow of pleasure which, of a surety would have mantled
  in her cheeks when she was shown the beauties of the great city.</p>
  <p>But now he was glad&mdash;very glad, that Sir Marmaduke had so sternly ordained
  that she should remain these few days alone at Acol in charge of Mistress
  Charity and of Master Busy. At the time he had chafed bitterly at his own
  enforced silence: he would have given all he possessed in the world for the
  right to warn Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse that a wolf was prowling in the fold
  under cover of the night. He had seen Lady Sue&rsquo;s eyes brighten at the
  dictum that she was to remain behind&mdash;they told him in eloquent language
  the joy she felt to be free for two days that she might meet her prince undisturbed.</p>
  <p>But all these thoughts and fears had fled the moment Lambert found himself
  in the midst of these people, whom he innocently believed to be great ladies
  and noble gentlemen, friends of his employer Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse. It
  seemed to him at once as if there was something here&mdash;in this room&mdash;which
  he would not wish Lady Sue to see.</p>
  <p>He was clumsy and <i>gauche</i> in his movements as he took the hand which
  Mistress Endicott extended to him, but he tried to imitate the salute which
  he had seen his employer give on the flat&mdash;not very clean&mdash;finger-tips
  of the lady.</p>
  <p>She was exceedingly gracious to him, saying with great kindliness and a
  melancholy sigh:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! you come from the country, master? ... So delightful, of a truth....
  Milk for breakfast, eh? ... You get up at dawn and go to bed at sunset? ...
  I know country life well&mdash;though alas! duty now keeps me in town....
  But &rsquo;tis small wonder that you look so young!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He tried to talk to her of the country, for here she had touched on a topic
  which was dear to him. He knew all about the birds and beasts, the forests
  and the meadows, and being unused to the art of hypocritical interest, he
  took for real sympathy the lady&rsquo;s vapid exclamations of enthusiasm,
  with which she broke in now and again upon his flow of eloquence.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, who was watching the young man with febrile keenness,
  had the satisfaction to note that very soon Richard began to throw off his
  bucolic timidity, his latent yet distinctly perceptible disapproval of the
  company into which he had been brought. He sought out his sister-in-law and
  drew her attention to Lambert in close conversation with Mrs. Endicott.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is everything arranged?&rdquo; he asked under his breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No trouble with our henchmen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A little ... but they are submissive now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is the arrangement?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Persuade young Lambert to take a hand at primero ... Endicott will
  do the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who is in the know?&rdquo; he queried, after a slight pause, during
  which he watched his unsuspecting victim with a deep frown of impatience
  and of hate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only the Endicotts,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;But do you think
  that he will play?&rdquo; she added, casting an anxious look on her brother-in-law&rsquo;s
  face.</p>
  <p>He nodded affirmatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he said curtly. &ldquo;I can arrange that, as soon as
  you are ready.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She turned from him and walked to the center table. She watched the game
  for a while, noting that young Segrave was still the winner, and that Lord
  Walterton was very flushed and excited.</p>
  <p>Then she caught Endicott&rsquo;s eye, and immediately lowered her lashes
  twice in succession.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ventre-saint-gris!&rdquo; swore Endicott with an unmistakable British
  accent in the French expletive, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll play no more.... The
  bank is broken ... and I have lost too much money. Mr. Segrave there has
  nearly cleaned me out and still I cannot break his luck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rose abruptly from his chair, even as Mistress de Chavasse quietly walked
  away from the table.</p>
  <p>But Lord Walterton placed a detaining, though very trembling hand, on the
  cinnamon-colored sleeve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! parbleu! ye cannot go like this ... good Master Endicott ...&rdquo; he
  said, speaking very thickly, &ldquo;I want another round or two ... &rsquo;pon
  my honor I do ... I haven&rsquo;t lost nearly all I meant to lose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye cannot stop play so abruptly, master,&rdquo; said Segrave, whose
  eyes shone with an unnatural glitter, and whose cheeks were covered with
  a hectic flush, &ldquo;ye cannot leave us all in the lurch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I doubt not, my young friend,&rdquo; quoth Endicott gruffly, &ldquo;that
  you would wish to play all night.... You have won all my money and Lord Walterton&rsquo;s,
  too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And most of mine,&rdquo; added Sir Michael Isherwood ruefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should not Master Segrave take the bank,&rdquo; here came in
  shrill accents from Mistress Endicott, who throughout her conversation with
  Lambert had kept a constant eye on what went on around her husband&rsquo;s
  table. &ldquo;He seems the only moneyed man amongst you all,&rdquo; she added
  with a laugh, which grated most unpleasantly on Richard&rsquo;s ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will gladly take the bank,&rdquo; said Segrave eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardi! I care not who hath the bank,&rdquo; quoth Lord Walterton,
  with the slow emphasis of the inebriated. &ldquo;My system takes time to
  work.... And I stand to lose a good deal unless ... hic ... unless I win!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not where you were, when you began,&rdquo; commented Sir
  Michael grimly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By Gad, no! ... hic ... but &rsquo;tis no matter.... Give me time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Methought I saw Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse just now,&rdquo; said Endicott,
  looking about him. &ldquo;Ah! and here comes our worthy baronet,&rdquo; he
  added cheerily as Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s closely cropped head&mdash;very noticeable
  in the crowd of periwigs&mdash;emerged from amidst the group that clustered
  round Mistress Endicott. &ldquo;A hand at primero, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, no!&rdquo; replied Sir Marmaduke, striving to master
  his habitual ill-humor and to speak pleasantly. &ldquo;My luck hath long
  since deserted me, if it e&rsquo;er visited me at all. A fact of which I
  grow daily more doubtful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But ventre-saint-gris!&rdquo; ejaculated Lord Walterton, who showed
  an inclination to become quarrelsome in his cups, &ldquo;we must have someone
  to take Endicott&rsquo;s place, I cannot work my system hic ... if so few
  play....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps your young friend, Sir Marmaduke ...&rdquo; suggested Mistress
  Endicott, waving an embroidered handkerchief in the direction of Richard
  Lambert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt! no doubt!&rdquo; rejoined Sir Marmaduke, turning with kindly
  graciousness to his secretary. &ldquo;Master Lambert, these gentlemen are
  requiring another hand for their game ... I pray you join in with them....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would do so with pleasure, sir,&rdquo; replied Lambert, still unsuspecting, &ldquo;but
  I fear me I am a complete novice at cards.... What is the game?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was vaguely distrustful of cards, for he had oft heard this pastime condemned
  as ungodly by those with whom he had held converse in his early youth, nevertheless
  it did not occur to him that there might be anything wrong in a game which
  was countenanced by Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, whom he knew to be an avowed
  Puritan, and by the saintly lady who had been the friend of ex-Queen Henrietta
  Maria.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a simple round game,&rdquo; said Sir Marmaduke lightly, &ldquo;you
  would soon learn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And ...&rdquo; said Lambert diffidently questioning, and eying the
  gold and silver which lay in profusion on the table, &ldquo;there is no money
  at stake ... of course? ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! only a little,&rdquo; rejoined Mistress Endicott, &ldquo;a paltry
  trifle ... to add zest to the enjoyment of the game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;However little it may be, Sir Marmaduke,&rdquo; said Lambert firmly,
  speaking directly to his employer, &ldquo;I humbly pray you to excuse me
  before these gentlemen ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The three players at the table, as well as the two Endicotts, had listened
  to this colloquy with varying feelings. Segrave was burning with impatience,
  Lord Walterton was getting more and more fractious, whilst Sir Michael Isherwood
  viewed the young secretary with marked hauteur. At the last words spoken
  by Lambert there came from all these gentlemen sundry ejaculations, expressive
  of contempt or annoyance, which caused an ugly frown to appear between de
  Chavasse&rsquo;s eyes, and a deep blush to rise in the young man&rsquo;s
  pale cheek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; queried Sir Marmaduke harshly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are other gentlemen here,&rdquo; said Lambert, speaking with
  more firmness and decision now that he encountered inimical glances and felt
  as if somehow he was on his trial before all these people, &ldquo;and I am
  not rich enough to afford the luxury of gambling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! if that is your difficulty,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Marmaduke, &ldquo;I
  pray you, good master, to command my purse ... you are under my wing to-night
  ... and I will gladly bear the burden of your losses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, Sir Marmaduke,&rdquo; said the young man, with quiet
  dignity,&rdquo; and I entreat you once again to excuse me.... I have never
  staked at cards, either mine own money or that of others. I would prefer
  not to begin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meseems ... hic ... de Chavasse, that this ... this young friend
  of yours is a hic ... damned Puritan ...&rdquo; came in ever thickening accents
  from Lord Walterton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope, Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse,&rdquo; here interposed Endicott
  with much pompous dignity, &ldquo;that your ... hem ... your young friend
  doth not desire to bring insinuations doubts, mayhap, against the honor of
  my house ... or of my friends!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! nay! good Endicott,&rdquo; said Sir Marmaduke, speaking in tones
  that were so conciliatory, so unlike his own quarrelsome temper, quick at
  taking offense, that Richard Lambert could not help wondering what was causing
  this change, &ldquo;Master Lambert hath no such intention&mdash;&rsquo;pon
  my honor ... He is young ... and ... and he misunderstands.... You see, my
  good Lambert,&rdquo; he added, once more turning to the young man, and still
  speaking with unwonted kindness and patience, &ldquo;you are covering yourself
  with ridicule and placing me&mdash;who am your protector to-night&mdash;in
  a very awkward position. Had I known you were such a gaby I should have left
  you to go to bed alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! Sir Marmaduke,&rdquo; here came in decisive accents from portly
  Mistress Endicott, &ldquo;methinks &rsquo;tis you who misunderstand Master
  Lambert. He is of a surety an honorable gentleman, and hath no desire to
  insult me, who have ne&rsquo;er done him wrong, nor yet my friends by refusing
  a friendly game of cards in my house!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She spoke very pointedly, causing her speech to seem like a menace, even
  though the words betokened gentleness and friendship.</p>
  <p>Lambert&rsquo;s scruples and his desire to please struggled hopelessly in
  his mind. Mistress Endicott&rsquo;s eye held him silent even while it urged
  him to speak. What could he say? Sir Marmaduke, toward whom he felt gratitude
  and respect, surely would not urge what he thought would be wrong for Lambert.</p>
  <p>And if a chaste and pure woman did not disapprove of a game of primero among
  friends, what right had he to set up his own standard of right or wrong against
  hers? What right had he to condemn what she approved? To offend his generous
  employer, and to bring opprobrium and ridicule on himself which would of
  necessity redound against Sir Marmaduke also?</p>
  <p>Vague instinct still entered a feeble protest, but reason and common sense
  and a certain undetermined feeling of what was due to himself socially&mdash;poor
  country bumpkin!&mdash;fought a hard battle too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am right, am I not, good Master Lambert?&rdquo; came in dulcet
  tones from the virtuous hostess, &ldquo;that you would not really refuse
  a quiet game of cards with my friends, at my entreaty ... in my house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Lambert, with a self-deprecatory sigh, and a shrug of the shoulders,
  said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have no option, gracious mistress!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  The Trap</b></h2>
  <p>Richard Lambert fortunately for his own peace of mind and the retention
  of his dignity, was able to wave aside the hand full of gold and silver coins
  which Sir Marmaduke extended towards him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, sir,&rdquo; he said calmly; &ldquo;I am able to bear
  the cost of mine own unavoidable weakness. I have money of mine own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From out his doublet he took a tiny leather wallet containing a few gold
  coins, his worldly all bequeathed to him the same as to his brother&mdash;so
  the old friend who had brought the lads up had oft explained&mdash;by his
  grandmother. The little satchel never left his person from the moment that
  the old Quakeress had placed it in his hands. There were but five guineas
  in all, to which he had added from time to time the few shillings which Sir
  Marmaduke paid him as salary.</p>
  <p>He chided his own weakness inwardly, when he felt the hot tears surging
  to his eyes at thought of the unworthy use to which his little hoard was
  about to be put.</p>
  <p>But he walked to the table with a bold step; there was nothing now of the
  country lout about him; on the contrary, he moved with remarkable dignity,
  and bore himself so well that many a pair of feminine eyes watched him kindly,
  as he took his seat at the baize-covered table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will one of you gentlemen teach me the game?&rdquo; he asked simply.</p>
  <p>It was remarkable that no one sneered at him again, and in these days of
  arrogance peculiar to the upper classes this was all the more noticeable,
  as these secret clubs were thought to be very exclusive, the resort pre-eminently
  of gentlemen and noblemen who were anti-Puritan, anti-Republican, and very
  jealous of their ranks and privileges.</p>
  <p>Yet when after those few unpleasant moments of hesitation Lambert boldly
  accepted the situation and with much simple dignity took his seat at the
  table, everyone immediately accepted him as an equal, nor did anyone question
  his right to sit there on terms of equality with Lord Walterton or Sir Michael
  Isherwood.</p>
  <p>His own state of mind was very remarkable at the moment.</p>
  <p>Of course he disapproved of what he did: he would not have been the Puritanically
  trained, country-bred lad that he was, if he had accepted with an easy conscience
  the idea of tossing about money from hand to hand, money that he could in
  no sense afford to lose, or money that no one was making any honest effort
  to win.</p>
  <p>He knew&mdash;somewhat vaguely perhaps, yet with some degree of certainty&mdash;that
  gambling was an illicit pastime, and that therefore he&mdash;by sitting at
  this table with these gentlemen, was deliberately contravening the laws of
  his country.</p>
  <p>Against all that, it is necessary to note that Richard Lambert took two
  matters very much in earnest: first, his position as a paid dependent; second,
  his gratitude to Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse.</p>
  <p>And both these all-pervading facts combined to force him against his will
  into this anomalous position of gentlemanly gambler, which suited neither
  his temperament nor his principles.</p>
  <p>With it all Lambert&rsquo;s was one of those dispositions, often peculiar
  to those who have led an isolated and introspective life, which never do
  anything half-heartedly; and just as he took his somewhat empty secretarial
  duties seriously, so did he look on this self-imposed task, against which
  his better judgment rebelled, with earnestness and determination.</p>
  <p>He listened attentively to the preliminary explanations given him sotto
  voce by Endicott. Segrave in the meanwhile had taken the latter&rsquo;s place
  at the head of the table. He had put all his money in front of him, some
  two hundred and sixty pounds all told, for his winnings during the last half
  hour had not been as steady as heretofore, and he had not yet succeeded altogether
  in making up that sum of money for which he yearned with all the intensity
  of a disturbed conscience, eager to redeem one miserable fault by another
  hardly more avowable.</p>
  <p>He shuffled the cards and dealt just as Endicott had done.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now will you look at your card, young sir,&rdquo; said Endicott,
  who stood behind Lambert&rsquo;s chair, whispering directions in his ear. &ldquo;A
  splendid card, begad! and one on which you must stake freely.... Nay! nay!
  that is not enough,&rdquo; he added, hurriedly restraining the young man&rsquo;s
  hand, who had timidly pushed a few silver coins forward. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
  thus you must do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And before Lambert had time to protest the rotund man in the cinnamon doublet
  and the wide lace cuffs, had emptied the contents of the little leather wallet
  upon the table.</p>
  <p>Five golden guineas rested on Lambert&rsquo;s card. Segrave turned up his
  own and declared:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pay queen and upwards!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A two, by gad!&rdquo; said Lord Walterton, too confused in his feeble
  head now to display any real fury. &ldquo;Did anyone ever see such accursed
  luck?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And look at this nine,&rdquo; quoth Sir Michael, who had become very
  sullen; &ldquo;not a card to-night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have a king,&rdquo; said Lambert quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And as I had the pleasure to remark before, my dear young friend,&rdquo; said
  Endicott blandly, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a mighty good card to hold.... And see,&rdquo; he
  continued, as Segrave without comment added five more golden guineas to Lambert&rsquo;s
  little hoard, &ldquo;see how wise it was to stake a goodly sum ... That is
  the whole art of the game of primero ... to know just what to stake on each
  card in accordance with its value and the law of averages.... But you will
  learn in time, young man you will learn....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The game doth not appear to be vastly complicated,&rdquo; assented
  Lambert lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have played primero on a system for years ...&rdquo; quoth Lord
  Walterton sententiously, &ldquo;but to-night ... hic ... by Gad! ... I cannot
  make the system work right ... hic!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But already Segrave was dealing again. Lambert staked more coolly now. In
  his mind he had already set aside the original five guineas which came from
  his grandmother. With strange ease and through no merit of his own, yet perfectly
  straightforwardly and honestly, he had become the owner of another five;
  these he felt more justified in risking on the hazard of the game.</p>
  <p>But the goddess of Fortune smiling benignly on this country-bred lad, had
  in a wayward mood apparently taken him under her special protection. He staked
  and won again, and then again pleased at his success ... in spite of himself
  feeling the subtle poison of excitement creeping into his veins ... yet remaining
  perfectly calm outwardly the while.</p>
  <p>Segrave, on the other hand, was losing in exact proportion to the newcomer&rsquo;s
  winnings: already his pile of gold had perceptibly diminished, whilst the
  hectic flush on his cheeks became more and more accentuated, the glitter
  in his eyes more unnatural and feverish, his hands as they shuffled and dealt
  the cards more trembling and febrile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my honor,&rdquo; quoth Sir Marmaduke, throwing a careless
  glance at the table, &ldquo;meseems you are in luck, my good Lambert. Doubtless,
  you are not sorry now that you allowed yourself to be persuaded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not unpleasant to win,&rdquo; rejoined Lambert lightly, &ldquo;but
  believe me, sir, the game itself gives me no pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pay knave and upwards,&rdquo; declared Segrave in a dry and hollow
  voice, and with burning eyes fixed upon his new and formidable opponent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My last sovereign, par Dieu!&rdquo; swore Lord Walterton, throwing
  the money across to Segrave with an unsteady hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And one of my last,&rdquo; said Sir Michael, as he followed suit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what is your stake, Master Lambert?&rdquo; queried Segrave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty pounds I see,&rdquo; replied the young man, as with a careless
  hand he counted over the gold which lay pell-mell on his card; &ldquo;I staked
  on the king without counting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Segrave in his turn pushed some gold towards him. The pile in front of him
  was not half the size it had been before this stranger from the country had
  sat down to play. He tried to remain master of himself, not to show before
  these egotistical, careless cavaliers all the agony of mind which he now
  endured and which had turned to positive physical torture.</p>
  <p>The ghost of stolen money, of exposure, of pillory and punishment which
  had so perceptibly paled as he saw the chance of replacing by his unexpected
  winnings that which he had purloined, once more rose to confront him. Again
  he saw before him the irascible employer, pointing with relentless finger
  at the deficiency in the accounts, again he saw his weeping mother, his stern
  father,&mdash;the disgrace, the irretrievable past.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not leaving off playing, Sir Michael?&rdquo; he asked anxiously,
  as the latter having handed him over a golden guinea, rose from the table
  and without glancing at his late partners in the game, turned his back on
  them all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Par Dieu!&rdquo; he retorted, speaking roughly, and none too civilly
  over his shoulder, &ldquo;my pockets are empty.... Like Master Lambert here,&rdquo; he
  added with an unmistakable sneer, &ldquo;I find no pleasure in <i>this</i> sort
  of game!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; queried Segrave hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; rejoined the other dryly, &ldquo;you need not
  heed my remark. Are you not losing, too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What does he mean?&rdquo; said Lambert with a puzzled frown, instinctively
  turning to his employer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naught! naught! my good Lambert,&rdquo; replied Sir Marmaduke, dropping
  his voice to a whisper. &ldquo;Sir Michael Isherwood hath lost more than
  he can afford and is somewhat choleric of temper, that is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And in a little quiet game, my good young friend,&rdquo; added Endicott,
  also in a whisper, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis wisest to take no heed of a loser&rsquo;s
  vapors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pay ace only!&rdquo; quoth Segrave triumphantly, who in the meanwhile
  had continued the game.</p>
  <p>Lord Walterton swore a loud and prolonged oath. He had staked five guineas
  on a king and had lost.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ventre-saint-gris, and likewise par le sang-bleu!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
  first time I have had a king! Segrave, ye must leave me these few little
  yellow toys, else I cannot pay for my lodgings to-night.... I&rsquo;ll give
  you a bill ... but I&rsquo;ve had enough of this, by Gad!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And somewhat sobered, though still unsteady, he rose from the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely, my lord, you are not leaving off, too?&rdquo; asked Segrave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! ... how can I continue?&rdquo; He turned his breeches pockets
  ostentatiously inside out. &ldquo;Behold, friend, these two beautiful and
  innocent little dears!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can give me more bills ...&rdquo; urged Segrave, &ldquo;and you
  lose ... you may not lose after this ... &rsquo;tis lucky to play on credit
  ... and ... and your bills are always met, my lord ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He spoke with feverish volubility, though his throat was parched and every
  word he uttered caused him pain. But he was determined that the game should
  proceed.</p>
  <p>He had won a little of his own back again the last few rounds. Certainly
  his luck would turn once more. His luck <i>must</i> turn once more, or else
  ...</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! nay! I&rsquo;ve had enough,&rdquo; said Lord Walterton, nodding
  a heavy head up and down, &ldquo;there are too many of my bills about as
  it is.... I&rsquo;ve had enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Methinks, of a truth,&rdquo; said Lambert decisively, &ldquo;that
  the game has indeed lasted long enough.... And if some other gentleman would
  but take my place ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He made a movement as if to rise from the table, but was checked by a harsh
  laugh and a peremptory word from Segrave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;you, Master Lambert, cannot
  leave off in any case.... My lord ... another hand ...&rdquo; he urged again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! nay! my dear Segrave,&rdquo; replied Lord Walterton, shaking
  himself like a sleepy dog, &ldquo;the game hath ceased to have any pleasure
  for me, as our young friend here hath remarked.... I wish you good luck ...
  and good-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon he turned on his heel and straddled away to another corner of
  the room, away from the temptation of that green-covered table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We two then, Master Lambert,&rdquo; said Segrave with ever-growing
  excitement, &ldquo;what say you? Double or quits?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And he pointed, with that same febrile movement of his, to the heap of gold
  standing on the table beside Lambert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; replied the latter quietly, as he pushed the
  entire pile forward.</p>
  <p>Segrave dealt, then turned up his card.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten!&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mine is a knave,&rdquo; rejoined Lambert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do we stand?&rdquo; queried the other, as with a rapid gesture
  he passed a trembling hand over his burning forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Methinks you owe me a hundred pounds,&rdquo; replied Richard, who
  seemed strangely calm in the very midst of this inexplicable and volcanic
  turmoil which he felt was seething all round him. He had won a hundred pounds&mdash;a
  fortune in those days for a country lad like himself; but for the moment
  the thought of what that hundred pounds would mean to him and to his brother
  Adam, was lost in the whirl of excitement which had risen to his head like
  wine.</p>
  <p>He had steadily refused the glasses of muscadel or sack which Mistress Endicott
  had insinuatingly and persistently been offering him, ever since he began
  to play; yet he felt intoxicated, with strange currents of fire which seemed
  to run through his veins.</p>
  <p>The subtle poison had done its work. Any remorse which he may have felt
  at first, for thus acting against his own will and better judgment, and for
  yielding like a weakling to persuasion, which had no moral rectitude for
  basis, was momentarily smothered by the almost childish delight of winning,
  of seeing the pile of gold growing in front of him. He had never handled
  money before; it was like a fascinating yet insidious toy which he could
  not help but finger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you not playing rather high, gentlemen?&rdquo; came in dulcet
  tones from Mistress Endicott; &ldquo;I do not allow high play in my house.
  Master Lambert, I would fain ask you to cease.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am more than ready, madam,&rdquo; said Richard with alacrity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! but I am not ready,&rdquo; interposed Segrave vehemently. &ldquo;Nay!
  nay!&rdquo; he repeated with feverish insistence, &ldquo;Master Lambert cannot
  cease playing now. He is bound in honor to give me a chance for revenge....
  Double or quits, Master Lambert! ... Double or quits?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; quoth Lambert imperturbably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye cannot cut to each other,&rdquo; here interposed Endicott didactically. &ldquo;The
  rules of primero moreover demand that if there are but two players, a third
  and disinterested party shall deal the cards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then will you cut and deal, Master Endicott,&rdquo; said Segrave
  impatiently; &ldquo;I care not so long as I can break Master Lambert&rsquo;s
  luck and redeem mine own.... Double or quits, Master Lambert.... Double or
  quits.... I shall either owe you two hundred pounds or not one penny....
  In which case we can make a fresh start....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert eyed him with curiosity, sympathetically too, for the young man
  was in a state of terrible mental agitation, whilst he himself felt cooler
  than before.</p>
  <p>Endicott dealt each of the two opponents a card face downwards, but even
  as he did so, the one which he had dealt to Lambert fluttered to the ground.</p>
  <p>He stooped and picked it up.</p>
  <p>Segrave&rsquo;s eyes at the moment were fixed on his own card, Lambert&rsquo;s
  on the face of his opponent. No one else in the room was paying any attention
  to the play of the two young men, for everyone was busy with his own affairs.
  Play was general, the hour late. The wines had been heady, and all tempers
  were at fever pitch.</p>
  <p>No one, therefore, was watching Endicott&rsquo;s movements at the moment
  when he ostensibly stooped to pick up the fallen card.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not faced,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give it to Master Lambert forsooth,&rdquo; quoth Mistress Endicott, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
  unlucky to re-deal ... providing,&rdquo; she added artfully, &ldquo;that
  Master Segrave hath no objection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! nay!&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;Begad! why should we stop
  the game for a trifle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as Lambert took the card from Endicott and casually glanced at it,
  Segrave declared:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Queen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;King!&rdquo; retorted Lambert, with the same perfect calm. &ldquo;King
  of diamonds ... that card has been persistently faithful to me to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The devil himself hath been faithful to you, Master Lambert ...&rdquo; said
  Segrave tonelessly, &ldquo;you have the hell&rsquo;s own luck.... What do
  I pay you now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was double or quits, Master Segrave,&rdquo; rejoined Lambert, &ldquo;which
  brings it up to two hundred pounds.... You will do me the justice to own
  that I did not seek this game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In his heart he had already resolved not to make use of his own winnings.
  Somehow as in a flash of intuition he perceived the whole tragedy of dishonor
  and of ruin which seemed to be writ on his opponent&rsquo;s face. He understood
  that what he had regarded as a toy&mdash;welcome no doubt, but treacherous
  for all that&mdash;was a matter of life or death&mdash;nay! more mayhap to
  that pallid youth, with the hectic flush, the unnaturally bright eyes and
  trembling hands.</p>
  <p>There was silence for a while round the green-topped table, whilst thoughts,
  feelings, presentiments of very varied kinds congregated there. With Endicott
  and his wife, and also with Sir Marmaduke, it was acute tension, the awful
  nerve strain of anticipation. The seconds for them seemed an eternity, the
  obsession of waiting was like lead on their brains.</p>
  <p>During that moment of acute suspense Richard Lambert was quietly co-ordinating
  his thoughts.</p>
  <p>With that one mental flash-light which had shown up to him the hitherto
  unsuspected tragedy, the latent excitement in him had vanished. He saw his
  own weakness in its true light, despised himself for having yielded, and
  looked upon the heap of gold before him as so much ill-gotten wealth, which
  it would be a delight to restore to the hand from whence it came.</p>
  <p>He heartily pitied the young man before him, and was forming vague projects
  of how best to make him understand in private and without humiliation that
  the money which he had lost would be returned to him in full. Strangely enough
  he was still holding in his hand that king of diamonds which Endicott had
  dealt to him.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
  Disgrace</b></h2>
  <p>Segrave, too, had been silent, of course. In his mind there was neither
  suspense nor calm. It was utter, dull and blank despair which assailed him,
  the ruin of his fondest hopes, an awful abyss of disgrace, of punishment,
  of death at best, which seemed to yawn before him from the other side of
  the baize-covered table.</p>
  <p>Instinct&mdash;that ever-present instinct of self-control peculiar to the
  gently-bred race of mankind&mdash;caused him to make frantic efforts to keep
  himself and his nerves in check. He would&mdash;even at this moment of complete
  ruin&mdash;have given the last shreds of his worldly possessions to be able
  to steady the febrile movements of his hand.</p>
  <p>The pack of cards was on the table, just as Endicott had put it down, after
  dealing, with the exception of the queen of hearts in front of Segrave and
  the lucky king of diamonds on which Lambert was still mechanically gazing.</p>
  <p>He was undoubtedly moved by the desire to hide the trembling of his hands
  and the gathering tears in his eyes when he began idly to scatter the pack
  upon the table, spreading out the cards, fingering them one by one, setting
  his teeth the while lest that latent cry of misery should force its way across
  his lips.</p>
  <p>Suddenly he paused in this idle fingering of the cards. His eyes which already
  were burning with hot tears, seemed to take on an almost savage glitter.
  A hoarse cry escaped his parched lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the name of Heaven, Master Segrave, what ails you?&rdquo; cried
  Endicott with well-feigned concern.</p>
  <p>Segrave&rsquo;s hand wandered mechanically to his own neck; he tugged at
  the fastening of his lace collar, as if, in truth, he were choking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The king.... The king of diamonds,&rdquo; he murmured in a hollow
  voice. &ldquo;Two ... two kings of diamonds....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He laughed, a long, harsh laugh, the laugh of a maniac, or of a man possessed,
  whilst one long thin finger pointed tremblingly to the card still held by
  Richard Lambert, and then to its counterpart in the midst of the scattered
  pack.</p>
  <p>That laugh seemed to echo all round the room. Dames and cavaliers, players
  and idlers, looked up to see whence that weird sound had come. Instinctively
  the crowd drew nigh, dice and cards were pushed aside. Some strange drama
  was being enacted between two young men, more interesting even than the caprices
  of Fortune.</p>
  <p>But already Endicott and also Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse had followed the
  beckonings of Segrave&rsquo;s feverish hand.</p>
  <p>There could be no mistake in what they saw nor yet in the ominous consequences
  which it foretold. There was a king of diamonds in the scattered pack of
  cards upon the table, and yet the card which Lambert held, in consequence
  of which he had just won two hundred pounds, was also the king of diamonds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two kings of diamonds ... by all that&rsquo;s damnable!&rdquo; quoth
  Lord Walterton, who had been the first to draw nigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But in Heaven&rsquo;s name, what does it all mean?&rdquo; exclaimed
  Lambert, gazing at the two cards, hearing the comments round him, yet utterly
  unable to understand.</p>
  <p>Segrave jumped to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It means, young man,&rdquo; he ejaculated in a wild state of frenzy,
  maddened by his losses, his former crime, his present ruin, &ldquo;it means
  that you are a damned thief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with frantic, excited gesture he gathered up the cards and threw them
  violently into Richard Lambert&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>A curious sound went round the room&mdash;a gasp, hardly a cry&mdash;and
  all those present held their breath, silent, appalled at the terrible tragedy
  expressed by these two young men standing face to face on the brink of a
  deathly and almost blasphemous conflict.</p>
  <p>Mistress Endicott was the first to utter a cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence! silence!&rdquo; she shouted shrilly. &ldquo;Master Segrave,
  I adjure you to be silent.... I&rsquo;ll not permit you to insult my guest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Already Lambert had made a quick movement to throw himself on Segrave. The
  elemental instinct of self-defense, of avenging a terrible insult by physical
  violence, rose within him, whispering of strength and power, of the freedom,
  muscle-giving life of the country as against the enervating, weakening influence
  of the town.</p>
  <p>He knew that in a hand-to-hand struggle with the feverish, emaciated townsman,
  he, the country-bred lad, the haunter of woods and cliffs, the dweller of
  the Thanet smithy, would be more than a match for his opponent. But even
  as his whole body stiffened for a spring, his muscles tightened and his fists
  clenched, a dozen restraining hands held him back from his purpose, whilst
  Mistress Endicott&rsquo;s shrill tones seemed to bring him back to the realities
  of his own peril.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mistress Endicott,&rdquo; he said, turning a proud, yet imploring
  look to the lady whose virtues had been so loudly proclaimed in his ears, &ldquo;Madam,
  I appeal to you ... I implore you to listen ... a frightful insult which
  you have witnessed ... an awful accusation on which I scarce can trust myself
  to dwell has been hurled at me.... I entreat you to allow me to challenge
  these two gentlemen to explain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And he pointed both to Segrave and to Endicott, The former, after his mad
  outburst of ungovernable rage, had regained a certain measure of calm. He
  stood, facing Lambert, with arms folded across his chest, whilst a smile
  of insulting irony curled his thin lips.</p>
  <p>Endicott&rsquo;s eyes seemed to be riveted on Lambert&rsquo;s breast.</p>
  <p>At mention of his own name, he suddenly darted forward, and seemed to be
  plunging his hand&mdash;the hand which almost disappeared within the ample
  folds of the voluminous lace cuff&mdash;into the breast pocket of the young
  man&rsquo;s doublet.</p>
  <p>His movements were so quick, so sure and so unexpected that no one&mdash;least
  of all Lambert&mdash;could possibly guess what was his purpose.</p>
  <p>The next moment&mdash;less than a second later&mdash;he had again withdrawn
  his hand, but now everyone could see that he held a few cards in it. These
  he dropped with an exclamation of loathing and contempt upon the table, whilst
  those around, instinctively drew back a step or two as if fearful of coming
  in contact with something impure and terrible.</p>
  <p>Endicott&rsquo;s movements, his quick gestures, well aided by the wide lace
  cuffs which fell over his hand, his exclamation of contempt, had all contributed
  to make it seem before the spectators as if he had found a few winning cards
  secreted inside the lining of Richard Lambert&rsquo;s doublet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! young sir,&rdquo; he said with an evil sneer, &ldquo;meseems
  that explanations had best come from you. Here,&rdquo; he added, pointing
  significantly at the cards which he had just dropped out of his own hand, &ldquo;here
  is a vastly pleasing collection ... aces and kings ... passing serviceable
  in a quiet game of primero among friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert had been momentarily dumfounded, for undoubtedly he had not perceived
  Endicott&rsquo;s treacherous movements, and had absolutely no idea whence
  had come those awful cards which somehow or other seemed to be convicting
  him of lying and cheating: so conscious was he of his own innocence, that
  never for a moment did the slightest fear cross his mind that he could not
  immediately make clear his own position, and proclaim his own integrity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is an infamous plot,&rdquo; he said calmly, but very firmly. &ldquo;Sir
  Marmaduke de Chavasse,&rdquo; he added, turning to face his employer, who
  still stood motionless and silent in the background, &ldquo;in the name of
  Heaven I beg of you to explain to these gentlemen that you have known me
  from boyhood. Will you speak?&rdquo; he added insistently, conscious of a
  strange tightening of his heartstrings as the man on whom he relied, remained
  impassive and made no movement to come to his help. &ldquo;Will you tell
  them, I pray you, sir, that you know me to be a man of honor, incapable of
  such villainy as they suggest? ... You know that I did not even wish to play
  ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That reluctance of yours, my good Lambert, seems to have been a pretty
  comedy forsooth,&rdquo; replied Sir Marmaduke lightly, &ldquo;and you played
  to some purpose, meseems, when you once began.... Nay! I pray you,&rdquo; he
  added with unmitigated harshness, &ldquo;do not drag me into your quarrels....
  I cannot of a truth champion your virtue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert&rsquo;s cheeks became deathly pale. The first inkling of the deadly
  peril of his own situation had suddenly come to him with Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s
  callous words. It seemed to him as if the very universe must stand still
  in the face of such treachery. The man whom he loved with all the fervor
  of a grateful nature, the man who knew him and whom he had wholly trusted,
  was proving his most bitter, most damning enemy.</p>
  <p>After Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s speech, his own employer&rsquo;s repudiation,
  he felt that all his chances of clearing his character before these sneering
  gentlemen had suddenly vanished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is cruel, and infamous,&rdquo; he protested, conscious innocence
  within him still striving to fight a hard battle against overwhelming odds. &ldquo;Gentlemen!
  ... as I am a man of honor, I swear that I do not know what all this means!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It means, young man, that you are an accursed cheat ... a thief ...
  a liar!&rdquo; shouted Segrave, whose last vestige of self-control suddenly
  vanished, whilst mad frenzy once more held him in its grip. &ldquo;I swear
  by God that you shall pay me for this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He threw himself with all the strength of a raving maniac upon Lambert,
  who for the moment was taken unawares, and yielded to the suddenness of the
  onslaught. But it was indeed a conflict &rsquo;twixt town and country, the
  simple life against nightly dissipations, the forests and cliffs of Thanet
  against the enervating atmosphere of the city.</p>
  <p>After that first onrush, Lambert, with marvelous agility and quick knowledge
  of a hand-to-hand fight, had shaken himself free of his opponent&rsquo;s
  trembling grasp. It was his turn now to have the upper hand, and in a trice
  he had, with a vigorous clutch, gripped his opponent by the throat.</p>
  <p>In a sense, his calmness had not forsaken him, his mind was as quiet, as
  clear as heretofore; it was only his muscle&mdash;his bodily energy in the
  face of a violent and undeserved attack&mdash;which had ceased to be under
  his control.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Man! man!&rdquo; he murmured, gazing steadily into the eyes of his
  antagonist, &ldquo;ye shall swallow those words&mdash;or by Heaven I will
  kill you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The tumult which ensued drowned everything save itself ... everything, even
  the sound of that slow and measured tramp, tramp, tramp, which was wafted
  up from the street.</p>
  <p>The women shouted, the men swore. Some ran like frightened sheep to the
  distant corners of the room, fearful lest they be embroiled in this unpleasant
  fracas ... others crowded round Segrave and Lambert, trying to pacify them,
  to drag the strong youth away from his weaker opponent&mdash;almost his victim
  now.</p>
  <p>Some were for forcibly separating them, others for allowing them to fight
  their own battles and loud-voiced arguments, subsidiary quarrels, mingled
  with the shrill cries of terror and caused a din which grew in deafening
  intensity, degenerating into a wild orgy as glasses were knocked off the
  tables, cards strewn about, candles sent flying and spluttering upon the
  ground.</p>
  <p>And still that measured tramp down the street, growing louder, more distinct,
  a muffled &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; the sound of arms, of men moving about beneath
  that yawning archway and along the dark and dismal passage with its hermetically
  closed front door.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
  My Lord Protector&rsquo;s Patrol</b></h2>
  <p>Alone, Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse had taken no part in the confused turmoil
  which raged around the personalities of Segrave and Richard Lambert. From
  the moment that he had&mdash;with studied callousness&mdash;turned his back
  on his erstwhile prot&eacute;g&eacute; he had held aloof from the crowd which
  had congregated around the two young men.</p>
  <p>He saw before him the complete success of his nefarious plan, which had
  originated in the active brain of Editha, but had been perfected in his own&mdash;of
  heaping dire and lasting disgrace on the man who had become troublesome and
  interfering of late, who was a serious danger to his more important schemes.</p>
  <p>After the fracas of this night Richard Lambert forsooth could never show
  his face within two hundred miles of London, the ugly story of his having
  cheated at cards and been publicly branded as a liar and a thief by a party
  of gentlemen would of a surety penetrate even within the fastnesses of Thanet.</p>
  <p>So far everything was for the best, nay, it might be better still, for Segrave
  enraged and maddened at his losses, might succeed in getting Lambert imprisoned
  for stealing, and cheating, even at the cost of his own condemnation to a
  fine for gambling.</p>
  <p>The Endicotts had done their part well. The man especially, with his wide
  cuffs and his quick movements. No one there present could have the slightest
  doubt but that Lambert was guilty. Satisfied, therefore, that all had gone
  according to his own wishes, Sir Marmaduke withdrew from further conflict
  or argument with the unfortunate young man, whom he had so deliberately and
  so hopelessly ruined.</p>
  <p>And because he thus kept aloof, his ears were not so completely filled with
  the din, nor his mind so wholly engrossed by the hand-to-hand struggle between
  the two young men, that he did not perceive that other sound, which, in spite
  of barred windows and drawn curtains, came up from the street below.</p>
  <p>At first he had only listened carelessly to the measured tramp. But the
  cry of &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; issuing from immediately beneath the windows caused
  his cheeks to blanch and his muscles to stiffen with a sudden sense of fear.</p>
  <p>He cast a rapid glance all around. Segrave and Lambert&mdash;both flushed
  and panting&mdash;were forcibly held apart. Sir Marmaduke noted with a grim
  smile that the latter was obviously the center of a hostile group, whilst
  Segrave was surrounded by a knot of sympathizers who were striving outwardly
  to pacify him, whilst in reality urging him on through their unbridled vituperations
  directed against the other man.</p>
  <p>The noise of arguments, of shrill voices, of admonitions and violent abuse
  had in no sense abated.</p>
  <p>Over the sea of excited faces Sir Marmaduke caught the wide-open, terrified
  eyes of Editha de Chavasse.</p>
  <p>She too, had heard.</p>
  <p>He beckoned to her across the room with a slight gesture of the hand, and
  she obeyed the silent call as quickly as she dared, working her way round
  to him, without arousing the attention of the crowd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not lose your head,&rdquo; he whispered as soon as she was near
  him and seeing the wild terror expressed in every line of her face. &ldquo;Slip
  into the next room ... and leave the door ajar.... Do this as quietly as
  may be ... now ... at once ... then wait there until I come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again she obeyed him silently and swiftly, for she knew what that cry of &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; meant,
  uttered at the door of her house. She had heard it, even as Sir Marmaduke
  had done, and after it the peremptory knocks, the loud call, the word of
  command, followed by the sound of an awed and supplicating voice, entering
  a feeble protest.</p>
  <p>She knew what all that meant, and she was afraid.</p>
  <p>As soon as Sir Marmaduke saw that she had done just as he had ordered, he
  deliberately joined the noisy groups which were congregated around Segrave
  and Lambert.</p>
  <p>He pushed his way forward and anon stood face to face with the young man
  on whom he had just wreaked such an irreparable wrong. Not a thought of compunction
  or remorse rose in his mind as he looked down at the handsome flushed face&mdash;quite
  calm and set outwardly in spite of the terrible agony raging within heart
  and mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lambert!&rdquo; he said gruffly, &ldquo;listen to me.... Your conduct
  hath been most unseemly.... Mistress Endicott has for my sake, already shown
  you much kindness and forbearance ... Had she acted as she had the right
  to do, she would have had you kicked out of the house by her servants....
  In your own interests now I should advise you to follow me quietly out of
  the house....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But this suggestion raised a hot protest on the part of all the spectators.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He shall not go!&rdquo; declared Segrave violently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not without leaving behind him what he has deliberately stolen,&rdquo; commented
  Endicott, raising his oily voice above the din.</p>
  <p>Lambert had waited patiently, whilst his employer spoke. The last remnant
  of that original sense of deference and of gratitude caused him to hold himself
  in check lest he should strike that treacherous coward in the face. Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s
  callousness in the face of his peril and unmerited disgrace, had struck Lambert
  with an overwhelming feeling of disappointment and loneliness. But his cruel
  insults now quashed despair and roused dormant indignation to fever pitch.
  One look at Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s sneering face had told him not only that
  he could expect no help from the man who&mdash;by all the laws of honor&mdash;should
  have stood by him in his helplessness, but that he was the fount and source,
  the instigator of the terrible wrong and injustice which was about to land
  an innocent man in the veriest abyss of humiliation and irretrievable disgrace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so this was your doing, Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse,&rdquo; he
  said, looking his triumphant enemy boldly in the face, even whilst compelling
  silent attention from those who were heaping opprobrious epithets upon him. &ldquo;You
  enticed me here.... You persuaded me to play, ... Then you tried to rob me
  of mine honor, of my good name, the only valuable assets which I possess....
  Hell and all its devils alone know why you did this thing, but I swear before
  God that your hideous crime shall not remain unpunished....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; commanded Sir Marmaduke, who was the first to perceive
  the strange, almost supernatural, effect produced on all those present, by
  the young man&rsquo;s earnestness, his impressive calm. Segrave himself stood
  silent and abashed, whilst everyone listened, unconsciously awed by that
  unmistakable note of righteousness which somehow rang through Lambert&rsquo;s
  voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! but I&rsquo;ll not be silent,&rdquo; quoth Richard unperturbed. &ldquo;I
  have been condemned ... and I have the right to speak.... You have disgraced
  me ... and I have the right to defend mine honor ... by protesting mine innocence....
  And now I will leave this house,&rdquo; he added loudly and firmly, &ldquo;for
  it is accursed and infamous ... but God is my witness that I leave it without
  a stain upon my soul....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He pointed to the fateful table whereon a pile of gold lay scattered in
  an untidy heap, with the tiny leather wallet containing his five guineas
  conspicuously in its midst.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There lies the money,&rdquo; he said, speaking directly to Segrave, &ldquo;take
  it, sir, for I had never the intention to touch a penny of it.... This I
  swear by all that I hold most sacred.... Take it without fear or remorse&mdash;even
  though you thought such evil things of me ... and let him who still thinks
  me a thief, repeat it now to my face&mdash;an he dare!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even as the last of his loudly uttered words resounded through the room,
  there was a loud knock at the door, and a peremptory voice commanded:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Open! in the name of His Highness, the Lord Protector of England!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In the dead silence that followed, the buzz of a fly, the spluttering of
  wax candles, could be distinctly heard.</p>
  <p>In a moment with the sound of that peremptory call outside, tumultuous passions
  seemed to sink to rest, every cheek paled, and masculine hands instinctively
  sought the handles of swords whilst lace handkerchiefs were hastily pressed
  to trembling lips, in order to smother the cry of terror which had risen
  to feminine throats.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Open! in the name of His Highness, the Lord Protector of England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mistress Endicott was the color of wax, her husband was gripping her wrist
  with a clutch of steel, trying, through the administration of physical pain,
  to keep alive her presence of mind.</p>
  <p>And for the third time came the loud summons:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Open! in the name of His Highness the Lord, Protector of England!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still that deathly silence in the room, broken only now by the firm step
  of Endicott, who went to open the door.</p>
  <p>Resistance had been worse than useless. The door would have yielded at the
  first blow. There was a wailing, smothered cry from a dozen terrified throats,
  and a general rush for the inner room. But this door now was bolted and barred,
  Sir Marmaduke&mdash;unperceived&mdash;had slipped quickly within, even whilst
  everyone held his breath in the first moment of paralyzed terror.</p>
  <p>Had there been time, there would doubtless have ensued a violent attack
  against that locked door, but already a man in leather doublet and wearing
  a steel cap and collar had peremptorily pushed Endicott aside, who was making
  a futile effort to bar the way, after he had opened the door.</p>
  <p>This man now advanced into the center of the room, whilst a couple of soldierly-looking,
  stalwart fellows remained at attention on the threshold.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let no one attempt to leave this room,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Here,
  Bradden,&rdquo; he added, turning back to his men, &ldquo;take Pyott with
  you and search that second room there ... then seize all those cards and
  dice and also that money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was not likely that these hot-headed cavaliers would submit thus quietly
  to an arbitrary act of confiscation and of arrest. Hardly were the last words
  out of the man&rsquo;s mouth than a dozen blades flashed out of their scabbards.</p>
  <p>The women screamed, and like so many frightened hens, ran into the corner
  of the room furthest out of reach of my Lord Protector&rsquo;s police-patrol,
  the men immediately forming a bulwark in front of them.</p>
  <p>The whole thing was not very heroic perhaps. A few idlers caught in an illicit
  act and under threat of arrest. The consequences&mdash;of a truth&mdash;would
  not be vastly severe for the frequenters of this secret club; fines mayhap,
  which most of those present could ill afford to pay, and at worst a night&rsquo;s
  detention in one of those horrible wooden constructions which had lately
  been erected on the river bank for the express purpose of causing sundry
  lordly offenders to pass an uncomfortable night.</p>
  <p>These were days of forcible levelings: and my lord who had contravened old
  Noll&rsquo;s laws against swearing and gambling, fared not one whit better
  than the tramp who had purloined a leg of mutton from an eating-house.</p>
  <p>Nay! in a measure my lord fared a good deal worse, for he looked upon his
  own detention through the regicide usurper&rsquo;s orders, as an indignity
  to himself; hence the reason why in this same house wherein a few idle scions
  of noble houses indulged in their favorite pastime, when orders rang out
  in the name of His Highness, swords jumped out of their sheaths, and resistance
  was offered out of all proportion to the threat.</p>
  <p>The man who seemed to be the captain of the patrol smiled somewhat grimly
  when he saw himself confronted by this phalanx of gentlemanly weapons. He
  was a tall, burly fellow, broad of shoulder and well-looking in his uniform
  of red with yellow facings; his round bullet-shaped head, covered by the
  round steel cap, was suggestive of obstinacy, even of determination.</p>
  <p>He eyed the flushed and excited throng with some amusement not wholly unmixed
  with contempt. Oh! he knew some of the faces well enough by sight&mdash;for
  he had originally served in the train-bands of London, and had oft seen my
  Lord Walterton, for instance, conspicuous at every entertainment&mdash;now
  pronounced illicit by His Highness, and Sir Anthony Bridport, a constant
  frequenter at Exeter House, and young Lord Naythmire the son of the Judge.
  He also had certainly seen young Segrave before this, whose father had been
  a member of the Long Parliament; the only face that was totally strange to
  him was that of the youngster in the dark suit of grogram, who stood somewhat
  aloof from the irate crowd, and seemed to be viewing the scene with astonishment
  rather than with alarm.</p>
  <p>Lord Walterton, flushed with wine, more than with anger, constituted himself
  the spokesman of the party:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked somewhat unsteadily, &ldquo;and what
  do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My name is Gunning,&rdquo; replied the man curtly, &ldquo;captain
  commanding His Highness&rsquo; police. What I want is that you gentlemen
  offer no resistance, but come with me quietly to answer on the morrow before
  Judge Parry, a charge of contravening the laws against betting and gambling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A ribald and prolonged laugh greeted this brief announcement, and some twenty
  pairs of gentlemanly shoulders were shrugged in token of derision.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hark at the man!&rdquo; quoth Sir James Overbury lightly, &ldquo;methinks,
  gentlemen, that our wisest course would be to put up our swords and to throw
  the fellows downstairs, what say you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! aye!&rdquo; came in cheerful accents from the defiant little
  group.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out with you fellow, we&rsquo;ve no time to waste in bandying words
  with ye ...&rdquo; said Walterton, with the tone of one accustomed to see
  the churl ever cringe before the lord, &ldquo;and let one of thy myrmidons
  touch a thing in this room if he dare!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The young cavalier was standing somewhat in advance of his friends, having
  stepped forward in order to emphasize the peremptoriness of his words. The
  women were still in the background well protected by a phalanx of resolute
  defenders who, encouraged by the captain&rsquo;s silence and Walterton&rsquo;s
  haughty attitude, were prepared to force the patrol of police to beat a hasty
  retreat.</p>
  <p>Endicott and his wife had seemed to think it prudent to keep well out of
  sight: the former having yielded to Gunning&rsquo;s advance had discreetly
  retired amongst the petticoats.</p>
  <p>No one, least of all Walterton, who remained the acknowledged leader of
  the little party of gamesters, had any idea of the numerical strength of
  the patrol whose interference with gentlemanly pastimes was unwarrantable
  and passing insolent. In the gloom on the landing beyond, a knot of men could
  only be vaguely discerned. Captain Gunning and his lieutenant, Bradden, had
  alone advanced into the room.</p>
  <p>But now apparently Gunning gave some sign, which Bradden then interpreted
  to the men outside. The sign itself must have been very slight for none of
  the cavaliers perceived it&mdash;certainly no actual word of command had
  been spoken, but the next moment&mdash;within thirty seconds of Walterton&rsquo;s
  defiant speech, the room itself, the doorway and apparently the landing and
  staircase too, were filled with men, each one attired in scarlet and yellow,
  all wearing leather doublets and steel caps, and all armed with musketoons
  which they were even now pointing straight at the serried ranks of the surprised
  and wholly unprepared gamesters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would fain not give an order to fire,&rdquo; said Captain Gunning
  curtly, &ldquo;and if you, gentlemen, will follow me quietly, there need
  be no bloodshed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It may be somewhat unromantic but it is certainly prudent, to listen at
  times to the dictates of common sense, and one of wisdom&rsquo;s most cogent
  axioms is undoubtedly that it is useless to stand up before a volley of musketry
  at a range of less than twelve feet, unless a heroic death is in contemplation.</p>
  <p>It was certainly very humiliating to be ordered about by a close-cropped
  Puritan, who spoke in nasal tones, and whose father probably had mended boots
  or killed pigs in his day, but the persuasion of twenty-four musketoons,
  whose muzzles pointed collectively in one direction, was bound&mdash;in the
  name of common sense&mdash;to prevail ultimately.</p>
  <p>Of a truth, none of these gentlemen&mdash;who were now content to oppose
  a comprehensive vocabulary of English and French oaths to the brand-new weapons
  of my Lord Protector&rsquo;s police&mdash;were cowards in any sense of the
  word. Less than a decade ago they had proved their mettle not only sword
  in hand, but in the face of the many privations, sorrows and humiliations
  consequent on the failure of their cause and the defeat, and martyrdom of
  their king. There was, therefore, nothing mean or pusillanimous in their
  attitude when having exhausted their vocabulary of oaths and still seeing
  before them the muzzles of four-and-twenty musketoons pointed straight at
  them, they one after another dropped their sword points and turned to read
  in each other&rsquo;s faces uniform desire to surrender to <i>force majeure</i>.</p>
  <p>The Captain watched them&mdash;impassive and silent&mdash;until the moment
  when he too, could discern in the sullen looks cast at him by some twenty
  pairs of eyes, that these elegant gentlemen had conquered their impulse to
  hot-headed resistance.</p>
  <p>But the four-and-twenty musketoons were still leveled, nor did the round-headed
  Captain give the order to lower the firearms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can release most of you, gentlemen, on parole,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an
  you&rsquo;ll surrender your swords to me, you may go home this night, under
  promise to attend the Court to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bradden in the meanwhile had gone to the inner door and finding it locked
  had ordered his companion to break it open. It yielded to the first blow
  dealt with a vigorous shoulder. The lieutenant went into the room, but finding
  it empty, he returned and soon was busy in collecting the various &ldquo;<i>pi&egrave;ces
  de convictions</i>,&rdquo; which would go to substantiate the charges of
  gambling and betting against these noble gentlemen. No resistance now was
  offered, and after a slight moment of hesitation and a brief consultation &rsquo;twixt
  the more prominent cavaliers there present, Lord Walterton stepped forward
  and having unbuckled his sword, threw it with no small measure of arrogance
  and disdain at the feet of Captain Gunning.</p>
  <p>His example was followed by all his friends, Gunning with arms folded across
  his chest, watching the proceeding in silence. When Endicott stood before
  him, however, he said curtly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not you, I think. Meseems I know you too well, fine sir, to release
  you on parole. Bradden,&rdquo; he added, turning to his lieutenant, &ldquo;have
  this man duly guarded and conveyed to Queen&rsquo;s Head Alley to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as Endicott tried to protest, and Gunning gave a sharp order for his
  immediate removal, Segrave pushed his way forward; he wore no sword, and
  like Lambert, had stood aloof throughout this brief scene of turbulent yet
  futile resistance, sullen, silent, and burning with a desire for revenge
  against the man who had turned the current of his luck, and brought him back
  to that abyss of despair, whence he now knew there could be no release.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; he said firmly, &ldquo;though I wear no sword I am
  at one with all these gentlemen, and I accept my release on parole. To-morrow
  I will answer for my offense of playing cards, which apparently, is an illicit
  pastime. I am one of the pigeons who have been plucked in this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By that gentleman?&rdquo; queried Gunning with a grim smile and nodding
  over his shoulder in the direction where Endicott was being led away by a
  couple of armed men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! not by him!&rdquo; replied Segrave boldly.</p>
  <p>With a somewhat theatrical gesture he pointed to Lambert, who, more of a
  spectator than a participant in the scene, had been standing mutely by outside
  the defiant group, absorbed in his own misery, wondering what effect the
  present unforeseen juncture would have on his future chances of rehabilitating
  himself.</p>
  <p>He was also vaguely wondering what had become of Sir Marmaduke and Mistress
  de Chavasse.</p>
  <p>But now Segrave&rsquo;s voice was raised, and once more Lambert found himself
  the cynosure of a number of hostile glances.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There stands the man who has robbed us all,&rdquo; said Segrave wildly, &ldquo;and
  now he has heaped disgrace upon us, upon me and mine.... Curse him! ... curse
  him, I say!&rdquo; he continued, whilst all the pent-up fury, forcibly kept
  in check all this while by the advent of the police, now once more found
  vent in loud vituperation and almost maniacal expressions of rage. &ldquo;Liar
  ... cheat! ... Look at him, Captain! there stands the man who must bear the
  full brunt of the punishment, for he is the decoy, he is the thief! ... The
  pillory for him ... the pillory ... the lash ... the brand! ... Curse him!
  ... Curse him! ... the thief! ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was surrounded and forcibly silenced. The foam had risen to his lips,
  impotent fury and agonized despair had momentarily clouded his brain. Lambert
  tried to speak, but the Captain, unwilling to prolong a conflict over which
  he was powerless to arbitrate, gave a sign to Bradden and anon the two young
  men were led away in the wake of Endicott.</p>
  <p>The others on giving their word that they would appear before the Court
  on the morrow, and answer to the charge preferred against them, were presently
  allowed to walk out of the room in single file between a double row of soldiers
  whose musketoons were still unpleasantly conspicuous.</p>
  <p>Thus they passed out one by one, across the passage and down the dark staircase.
  The door below they found was also guarded; as well as the passage and the
  archway giving on the street.</p>
  <p>Here they were permitted to collect or disperse at will. The ladies, however,
  had not been allowed to participate in the order for release. Gunning knew
  most of them by sight,&mdash;they were worthy neither of consideration nor
  respect,&mdash;paid satellites of Mistress Endicott&rsquo;s, employed to
  keep up the good spirits of that lady&rsquo;s client&egrave;le.</p>
  <p>The soldiers drove them all together before them, in a compact, shrinking
  and screaming group. Then the word of command was given. The soldiers stood
  at attention, turned and finally marched out of the room with their prisoners,
  Gunning being the last to leave.</p>
  <p>He locked the door behind him and in the wake of his men presently wended
  his way down the tortuous staircase.</p>
  <p>Once more the measured tramp was heard reverberating through the house,
  the cry of &ldquo;Attention!&rdquo; of &ldquo;Quick march!&rdquo; echoed
  beneath the passage and the tumble-down archway, and anon the last of these
  ominous sounds died away down the dismal street in the direction of the river.</p>
  <p>And in one of the attics at the top of the now silent and lonely house in
  Bath Street&mdash;lately the scene of so much gayety and joy, of such turmoil
  of passions and intensity of despair&mdash;two figures, a man and a woman,
  crouched together in a dark corner, listening for the last dying echo of
  that measured tramp.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
  In The Meanwhile</b></h2>
  <p>The news of the police raid on a secret gambling club in London, together
  with the fracas which it entailed, had of necessity reached even as far as
  sea-girt Thanet. Squire Boatfield had been the first to hear of it; he spread
  the news as fast as he could, for he was overfond of gossip, and Dame Harrison
  over at St. Lawrence had lent him able assistance.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke had, of course, the fullest details concerning the affair,
  for he himself owned to having been present in the very house where the disturbance
  had occurred. He was not averse to his neighbors knowing that he was a frequenter
  of those exclusive and smart gambling clubs, which were avowedly the resort
  of the most elegant cavaliers of the day, and his account of some of the
  events of that memorable night had been as entertaining as it was highly-colored.</p>
  <p>He avowed, however, that, disgusted at Richard Lambert&rsquo;s shameful
  conduct, he had quitted the place early, some little while before my Lord
  Protector&rsquo;s police had made a descent upon the gamblers. As for Mistress
  de Chavasse, her name was never mentioned in connection with the affair.
  She had been in London at the time certainly, staying with a friend, who
  was helping her in the choice of a new gown for the coming autumn.</p>
  <p>She returned to Acol Court with her brother-in-law, apparently as horrified
  as he was at the disgrace which she vowed Richard Lambert had heaped upon
  them all.</p>
  <p>The story of the young man being caught in the very act of cheating at cards
  lost nothing in the telling. He had been convicted before Judge Parry of
  obtaining money by lying and other illicit means, had been condemned to fine
  and imprisonment and as he refused to pay the former&mdash;most obstinately
  declaring that he was penniless&mdash;he was made to stand for two hours
  in the pillory, and was finally dragged through the streets in a rickety
  cart in full sight of a jeering crowd, sitting with his back to the nag in
  company of the public hangman, and attired in shameful and humiliating clothes.</p>
  <p>What happened to him after undergoing this wonderfully lenient sentence&mdash;for
  many there were who thought he should have been publicly whipped and branded
  as a cheat&mdash;nobody knew or cared.</p>
  <p>They kept him in prison for over ten weeks, it seems, but Sir Marmaduke
  did not know what had become of him since then.</p>
  <p>The other gentlemen got off fairly lightly with fines and brief periods
  of imprisonment. Young Segrave, so &rsquo;twas said, had been shipped to
  New England by his father, but Master and Mistress Endicott had gone beyond
  the seas at the expense of the State, and not for their own pleasure or advancement.
  It appears that my Lord Protector&rsquo;s vigilance patrol had kept a very
  sharp eye on these two people, who had more than once had to answer for illicit
  acts before the Courts. They tried in a most shameful manner it appears,
  to implicate Sir Marmaduke and Mistress de Chavasse in their disgrace, but
  as the former very pertinently remarked, &ldquo;How could he, a simple Kentish
  squire have aught to do with a smart London club? and people of such evil
  repute as the Endicotts could of a truth never be believed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All these rumors and accounts had, of course, also reached Sue&rsquo;s ears.
  At first she took up an attitude of aggressive incredulity when her former
  friend was accused: nothing but the plain facts as set forth in the <i>Public
  Advertiser</i> of August the 5th would convince her that Richard Lambert
  could be so base and mean as Sir Marmaduke had averred.</p>
  <p>Even then, in her innermost heart, a vague and indefinable instinct called
  out to her in Lambert&rsquo;s name, not to believe all that was said of him.
  She could not think of him as lying, and cheating at a game of cards, when
  common sense itself told her that he was not sufficiently conversant with
  its rules to turn them to his own advantage. Her hot-headed partisanship
  of him gave way of necessity as the weeks sped by, to a more passive disapproval
  of his condemnation, and this in its turn to a kindly charity for what she
  thought must have been his ignorance rather than his sin.</p>
  <p>What worried her most was that he was not nigh her, now that her sentimental
  romance was reaching its super-acute crisis. During her guardian&rsquo;s
  temporary absence from Acol she had made earnest and resolute efforts to
  see her mysterious lover. She thought that he must know that Sir Marmaduke
  and Mistress de Chavasse were away and that she herself was free momentarily
  from watchful eyes.</p>
  <p>Yet though with pathetic persistence she haunted the park and the woodlands
  around the Court, she never even once caught sight of the broad-brimmed hat
  and drooping plume of her romantic prince. It seemed as if the earth had
  swallowed him up.</p>
  <p>Upset and vaguely terrified, she had on one occasion thrown prudence to
  the winds and sought out the old Quakeress and Adam Lambert with whom he
  lodged. But the old Quakeress was very deaf, and explanations with her were
  laborious and unsatisfactory, whilst Adam seemed to entertain a sullen and
  irresponsible dislike for the foreigner.</p>
  <p>All she gathered from these two was that there was nothing unusual in this
  sudden disappearance of their lodger. He came and went most erratically,
  went no one knew whither, returned at most unexpected moments, never slept
  more than an hour or two in his bed which he quitted at amazingly early hours,
  strolling out of the cottage when all decent folk were just beginning their
  night&rsquo;s rest, and wandering off unseen, unheard, only to return as
  he had gone.</p>
  <p>He paid his money for his room regularly, however, and this was vastly acceptable
  these hard times.</p>
  <p>But to Sue it was passing strange that her prince should be out of her reach,
  just when Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s and Mistress de Chavasse&rsquo;s absence
  had made their meetings more easy and pleasant.</p>
  <p>Yet with it all, she was equally conscious of an unaccountable feeling of
  relief, and every evening, when at about eight o&rsquo;clock she returned
  homewards after having vainly awaited the prince, there was nothing of the
  sadness and disappointment in her heart which a maiden should feel when she
  has failed to see her lover.</p>
  <p>She was just as much in love with him as ever!&mdash;oh! of that she felt
  quite sure! she still thrilled at thought of his heroic martyrdom for the
  cause which he had at heart, she still was conscious of a wonderful feeling
  of elation when she was with him, and of pride when she saw this remarkable
  hero, this selfless patriot at her feet, and heard his impassioned declarations
  of love, even when these were alloyed with frantic outbursts of jealousy.
  She still yearned for him when she did not see him, even though she dreaded
  his ill-humor when he was nigh.</p>
  <p>She had promised to be his wife, soon and in secret, for he had vowed that
  she did not love him if she condemned him to three long months of infinite
  torture from jealousy and suspense.</p>
  <p>This promise she had given him freely and whole-heartedly more than a fortnight
  ago. Since that memorable evening when she had thus plighted her troth to
  him, when she had without a shadow of fear or a tremor of compunction entrusted
  her entire future, her heart and soul to his keeping, since then she had
  not seen him.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke had gone to London, also Mistress de Chavasse, and she had
  not even caught sight of the weird silhouette of her French prince. Lambert,
  too, had gone, put out of her way temporarily&mdash;or mayhap, forever&mdash;through
  the irresistible force of a terrible disgrace. There was no one to spy on
  her movements, no one to dog her footsteps, yet she had not seen him.</p>
  <p>When her guardian returned, he seemed so engrossed with Lambert&rsquo;s
  misdeeds that he gave little thought to his ward. He and Mistress de Chavasse
  were closeted together for hours in the small withdrawing-room, whilst she
  was left to roam about the house and grounds unchallenged.</p>
  <p>Then at last one evening&mdash;it was late August then&mdash;when despair
  had begun to grip her heart, and she herself had become the prey of vague
  fears, of terrors for his welfare, his life mayhap, on which he had oft told
  her that the vengeful King of France had set a price&mdash;one evening he
  came to greet her walking through the woods, treading the soft carpet of
  moss with a light elastic step.</p>
  <p>Oh! that had been a rapturous evening! one which she oft strove to recall,
  now that sadness had once more overwhelmed her. He had been all tenderness,
  all love, all passion! He vowed that he adored her as an idolater would worship
  his divinity. Jealous? oh, yes! madly, insanely jealous! for she was fair
  above all women and sweet and pure and tempting to all men like some ripe
  and juicy fruit ready to fall into a yearning hand.</p>
  <p>But his jealousy took on a note of melancholy and of humility. He worshiped
  her so and wished to feel her all his own. She listened entranced, forgetting
  her terrors, her disappointments, the vague ennui which had assailed her
  of late. She yielded herself to the delights of his caresses, to the joy
  of this hour of solitude and rapture. The night was close and stormy; from
  afar, muffled peals of thunder echoed through the gigantic elms, whilst vivid
  flashes of lightning weirdly lit up at times the mysterious figure of this
  romantic lover, with his face forever in shadow, one eye forever hidden behind
  a black band, his voice forever muffled.</p>
  <p>But it was a tempestuous wooing, a renewal of that happy evening in the
  spring&mdash;oh! so long ago it seemed now!&mdash;when first he had poured
  in her ear the wild torrents of his love. The girl&mdash;so young, so inexperienced,
  so romantic&mdash;was literally swept off her feet; she listened to his wild
  words, yielded her lips to his kiss, and whilst she half feared the impetuosity
  of his mood, she delighted in the very terrors it evoked.</p>
  <p>A secret marriage? Why, of course! since he suffered so terribly through
  not feeling her all his own. Soon!&mdash;at once!&mdash;at Dover before the
  clergyman at All Souls, with whom he&mdash;her prince&mdash;had already spoken.</p>
  <p>Yes! it would have to be at Dover, for the neighboring villages might prove
  too dangerous. Sir Marmaduke might hear of it, mayhap. It would rest with
  her to free herself for one day.</p>
  <p>Then came that delicious period of scheming, of stage-managing everything
  for the all-important day. He would arrange about a chaise, and she should
  walk up to the Canterbury Road to meet it. He would await her in the church
  at Dover, for &rsquo;twas best that they should not be seen together until
  after the happy knot was tied, when he declared that he would be ready to
  defy the universe.</p>
  <p>It had been a long interview, despite the tempest that raged above and around
  them. The great branches of the elms groaned and cracked under fury of the
  wind, the thunder pealed overhead and then died away with slow majesty out
  towards the sea. From afar could be heard the angry billows dashing themselves
  against the cliffs.</p>
  <p>They had to seek shelter under the colonnaded porch of the summerhouse,
  and Sue had much ado to keep the heavy drops of rain from reaching her shoes
  and the bottom of her kirtle.</p>
  <p>But she was attune with the storm, she loved to hear the weird sh-sh-sh
  of the leaves, the monotonous drip of the rain on the roof of the summer
  house, and in the intervals of intense blackness to catch sight of her lover&rsquo;s
  face, pale of hue, with one large eye glancing cyclops-like into hers, as
  a vivid flash of lightning momentarily tore the darkness asunder and revealed
  him still crouching at her feet.</p>
  <p>Intense lassitude followed the wild mental turmoil of that night. She had
  arranged to meet him again two days hence in order to repeat to him what
  she had heard the while of Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s movements, and when she
  was like to be free to go to Dover. During those intervening two days she
  tried hard to probe her own thoughts; her mind, her feelings: but what she
  found buried in the innermost recesses of her heart frightened her so, that
  she gave up thinking.</p>
  <p>She lay awake most of the night, telling herself how much she loved her
  prince; she spent half a day in the perusal of a strange book called <i>The
  Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet</i> by one William Shakespeare who had lived
  not so long ago: and found herself pondering as to whether her own sentiments
  with regard to her prince were akin to those so exquisitely expressed by
  those two young people who had died because they loved one another so dearly.</p>
  <p>Then she heard that towards the end of the week Sir Marmaduke and Mistress
  de Chavasse would be journeying together to Canterbury in order to confer
  with Master Skyffington the lawyer, anent her own fortune, which was to be
  handed to her in its entirety in less than three months, when she would be
  of age.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
  Breaking The News</b></h2>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke talked openly of this plan of going to Canterbury with Editha
  de Chavasse, mentioning the following Friday as the most likely date for
  his voyage.</p>
  <p>Full of joy she brought the welcome news to her lover that same evening;
  nor had she cause to regret then her ready acquiescence to his wishes. He
  was full of tenderness then, of gentle discretion in his caresses, showing
  the utmost respect to his future princess. He talked less of his passion
  and more of his plans, in which now she would have her full share. He confided
  some of his schemes to her: they were somewhat vague and not easy to understand,
  but the manner in which he put them before her, made them seem wonderfully
  noble and selfless.</p>
  <p>In a measure this evening&mdash;so calm and peaceful in contrast to the
  turbulence of the other night&mdash;marked one of the great crises in the
  history of her love. Even when she heard that Fate itself was conspiring
  to help on the clandestine marriage by causing Sir Marmaduke and Mistress
  de Chavasse to absent themselves at a most opportune moment, she had resolved
  to break the news to her lover of her own immense wealth.</p>
  <p>Of this he was still in total ignorance. One or two innocent remarks which
  he had let fall at different times convinced her of that. Nor was this ignorance
  of his to be wondered at: he saw no one in or about the village except the
  old Quakeress and Adam Lambert with whom he lodged. The woman was deaf and
  uncommunicative, whilst there seemed to be some sort of tacit enmity against
  the foreigner, latent in the mind of the blacksmith. It was, therefore, quite
  natural that he should suppose her no whit less poor than Sir Marmaduke de
  Chavasse or the other neighboring Kentish squires whose impecuniousness was
  too blatant a fact to be unknown even to a stranger in the land.</p>
  <p>Sue, therefore, was eagerly looking forward to the happy moment when she
  would explain to her prince that her share in the wonderful enterprise which
  he always vaguely spoke of as his &ldquo;great work&rdquo; would not merely
  be one of impassiveness. Where he could give the benefit of his personality,
  his eloquence, his knowledge of men and things, she could add the weight
  of her wealth.</p>
  <p>Of course she was very, very young, but already from him she had realized
  that it is impossible even to regenerate mankind and give it political and
  religious freedom without the help of money.</p>
  <p>Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans himself was passing rich:
  the fact that he chose to hide in a lonely English village and to live as
  a poor man would live, was only a part of his schemes. For the moment, too,
  owing to that ever-present vengefulness of the King of France, his estates
  and revenues were under sequestration. All this Sue understood full well,
  and it added quite considerably to her joy to think that soon she could relieve
  the patriot and hero from penury, and that the news that she could do so
  would be a glad surprise for him.</p>
  <p>Nor must Lady Sue Aldmarshe on this account be condemned for an ignorant
  or a vain fool. Though she was close on twenty-one years of age, she had
  had absolutely no experience of the world or of mankind: all she knew of
  either had been conceived in the imaginings of her own romantic brain.</p>
  <p>Her entire childhood, her youth and maidenhood had gone by in silent and
  fanciful dreamings, whilst one of the greatest conflicts the world had ever
  known was raging between men of the same kith and the same blood. The education
  of women&mdash;even of those of rank and wealth&mdash;was avowedly upon a
  very simple plan. Most of the noble ladies of that time knew not how to spell&mdash;most
  of them were content to let the world go by them, without giving it thought
  or care, others had accomplished prodigies of valor, of heroism, aye! and
  of determination to help their brothers, husbands, fathers during the worst
  periods of the civil war.</p>
  <p>But Sue had been too young when these same prodigies were being accomplished,
  and her father died before she had reached the age when she could take an
  active part in the great questions of the day. A mother she had never known,
  she had no brothers and sisters. A brief time under the care of an old aunt
  and a duenna in a remote Surrey village, and her stay at Pegwell Court under
  Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s guardianship, was all that she had ever seen of life.</p>
  <p>Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans was the embodiment of
  all her dreams&mdash;or nearly so! The real hero of her dreams had been handsomer,
  and also more gentle and more trusting, but on the whole, he had not been
  one whit more romantic in his personality and his doings.</p>
  <p>The manner in which he received the news that unbeknown to him, he had been
  wooing one of the richest brides in the land, was characteristic of him.
  He seemed boundlessly disappointed.</p>
  <p>It was a beautiful clear night and she could see his face quite distinctly,
  and could note how its former happy expression was marred suddenly by a look
  of sorrow. He owned to being disappointed. He had loved the idea, so he explained,
  of taking her to him, just as she was, beautiful beyond compare, but penniless&mdash;having
  only her exquisite self to give.</p>
  <p>Oh! the joy after that of coaxing him back to smiles! the pride of proving
  herself his Egeria for the nonce, teaching him how to look upon wealth merely
  as a means for attaining his great ends, for continuing his great work.</p>
  <p>It had been perhaps the happiest evening in her short life of love.</p>
  <p>For that day at Dover now only seemed a dream. The hurried tramp to the
  main road in a torrent of pouring rain: the long drive in the stuffy chaise,
  the arrival just in time for the brief&mdash;very brief&mdash;ceremony in
  the dark church, with the clergyman in a plain black gown muttering unintelligible
  words, and the local verger and the church cleaner acting as the witnesses
  to her marriage.</p>
  <p>Her marriage!</p>
  <p>How differently had she conceived that great, that wonderful day, the turning
  point of a maiden&rsquo;s life. Music, flowers, beautiful gowns and sweet
  scents filling the air! the sunlight peeping gold, red, purple or blue through
  the glass windows of some exquisite cathedral! The bridegroom arrayed in
  white, full of joy and pride, she the bride with a veil of filmy lace falling
  over her face to hide the happy blushes!</p>
  <p>It was a beautiful dream, and the reality was so very, very different.</p>
  <p>A dark little country church, with the plaster peeling off the walls! the
  drone of a bewhiskered, bald-headed parson being the sole music which greeted
  her ears. The rain beating against the broken window-panes, through which
  icy cold draughts of damp air reached her shoulders and caused her to shiver
  beneath her kerchief. She wore her pretty dove-colored gown, but it was not
  new nor had she a veil over her face, only a straw hat such as countrywomen
  wore, for though she was an heiress and passing rich, her guardian did but
  ill provide her with smart clothing.</p>
  <p>And the bridegroom?</p>
  <p>He had been waiting for her inside the church, and seemed impatient when
  she arrived. No one had helped her to alight from the rickety chaise, and
  she had to run in the pouring rain, through the miserable and deserted churchyard.</p>
  <p>His face seemed to scowl as she finally stood up beside him, in front of
  that black-gowned man, who was to tie between them the sacred and irrevocable
  knot of matrimony. His hand had perceptibly trembled when he slipped the
  ring on her finger, whilst she felt that her own was irresponsive and icy
  cold.</p>
  <p>She tried to speak the fateful &ldquo;I will!&rdquo; buoyantly and firmly,
  but somehow&mdash;owing to the cold, mayhap&mdash;the two little words almost
  died down in her throat.</p>
  <p>Aye! it had all been very gloomy, and inexpressibly sad. The ceremony&mdash;the
  dear, sweet, sacred ceremony which was to give her wholly to him, him unreservedly
  to her&mdash;was mumbled and hurried through in less than ten minutes.</p>
  <p>Her bridegroom said not a word. Together they went into the tiny vestry
  and she was told to sign her name in a big book, which the bald-headed parson
  held open before her.</p>
  <p>The prince also signed his name, and then kissed her on the forehead.</p>
  <p>The clergyman also shook hands and it was all over.</p>
  <p>She understood that she had been married by a special license, and that
  she was now legally and irretrievably the wife of Am&eacute;d&eacute; Henri,
  Prince d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans, de Bourgogne and several other places and
  dependencies abroad.</p>
  <p>She also understood from what the bald-headed clergyman had spoken when
  he stood before them in the church and read the marriage service that she
  as the wife owed obedience to her husband in all things, for she had solemnly
  sworn so to do. She herself, body and soul and mind, her goods and chattels,
  her wealth and all belongings were from henceforth the property of her husband.</p>
  <p>Yes, she had sworn to all that, willingly, and there was no going back on
  that, now or ever!</p>
  <p>But, oh! how she wished it had been different!</p>
  <p>Afterwards, when in the privacy of her own little room at Acol Court, she
  thought over the whole of that long and dismal day, she oft found herself
  wondering what it was through it all that had seemed so terrifying to her,
  so strange, so unreal.</p>
  <p>Something had struck her as weird: something which she could not then define;
  but she was quite sure that it was not merely the unusual chilliness of that
  rainy summer&rsquo;s day, which had caused her to tremble so, when&mdash;in
  the vestry&mdash;her husband had taken her hand and kissed her.</p>
  <p>She had then looked into his face, which&mdash;though the vestry was but
  ill lighted by a tiny very dusty window&mdash;she had never seen quite so
  clearly before, and then it was that that amazing sense of something awful
  and unreal had descended upon her like a clammy shroud.</p>
  <p>He had very swiftly averted his own gaze from her, but she had seen something
  in his face which she did not understand, over which she had pondered ever
  since without coming to any solution of this terrible riddle.</p>
  <p>She had pondered over it during that interminable journey back from Dover
  to Acol. Her husband had not even suggested accompanying her on her homeward
  way, nor did she ask him to do so. She did not even think it strange that
  he gave her no explanation of the reason why he should not return to his
  lodgings at Acol. She felt like a somnambulist, and wondered how soon she
  would wake and find herself in her small and uncomfortable bed at the Court.</p>
  <p>The next day that feeling of unreality was still there; that sensation of
  mystery, of something supernatural which persistently haunted her.</p>
  <p>One thing was quite sure; that all joy had gone out of her life. It was
  possible that love was still there&mdash;she did not know&mdash;she was too
  young to understand the complex sensations which suddenly had made a woman
  of her ... but it was a joyless love now: and all that she knew of a certainty
  about her own feelings at the present was that she hoped she would never
  have to gaze into her lover&rsquo;s face again ... and ... Heaven help her!
  ... that he might never touch her again with his lips.</p>
  <p>Obedient to his behests&mdash;hurriedly spoken as she stepped into the chaise
  at Dover after the marriage ceremony&mdash;she had wandered out every evening
  beyond the ha-ha into the park, on the chance of meeting him.</p>
  <p>The evenings now were soft and balmy after the rain: the air carried a pungent
  smell of dahlias and of oak-leaved geraniums to her nostrils, which helped
  her to throw off that miserable feeling of mental lassitude which had weighed
  her down ever since that fateful day at Dover. She walked slowly along, treading
  the young tendrils of the moss, watching with wistful eyes the fleecy clouds,
  as they appeared through the branches of the elms, scurrying swiftly out
  towards the sea ... out towards freedom.</p>
  <p>But evening after evening passed away, and she saw no sign of him. She felt
  the futility, the humiliating uselessness of these nightly peregrinations
  in search of a man who seemed to have a hundred more desirable occupations
  than that of meeting his wife. But she had not the power to drift out towards
  freedom now. She obeyed mechanically because she must. She had sworn to obey
  and he had bidden her come and wait for him.</p>
  <p>August yielded to September, the oak-leaved geraniums withered whilst from
  tangled bosquets the melancholy eyes of the Michaelmas daisies peeped out
  questioningly upon the coming autumn.</p>
  <p>Then one evening his voice suddenly sounded close to her ear, causing her
  to utter a quickly-smothered cry. It had been the one dull day throughout
  this past glorious month, the night was dark and a warm drizzle had soaked
  through to her shoulders and wetted the bottom of her kirtle so that it hung
  heavy and dank round her ankles. He had come to her as usual from out the
  gloom, just as she was about to cross the little bridge which spanned the
  sunk fence.</p>
  <p>She realized then, with one of those sudden quivers of her sensibilities,
  to which, alas! she had become so accustomed of late, that he had always
  met her thus in the gloom&mdash;always chosen nights when she could scarce
  see him distinctly, and this recollection still further enhanced that eerie
  feeling of terror which had assailed her since that fateful moment in the
  vestry.</p>
  <p>But she tried to be natural and even gay with him, though at the first words
  of tender reproach with which she gently chided him for his prolonged absence,
  he broke into one of those passionate accesses of fury which had always frightened
  her, but now left her strangely cold and unresponsive.</p>
  <p>Was the subtle change in him as well as in her? She could not say. Certain
  it is that, though his hands had sought hers in the darkness, and pressed
  them vehemently, when first they met he had not attempted to kiss her.</p>
  <p>For this she was immeasurably grateful.</p>
  <p>He was obviously constrained, and so was she, and when she opposed a cold
  silence to his outburst of passion, he immediately, and seemingly without
  any effort, changed his tone and talked more reasonably, even glibly of his
  work, which he said was awaiting him now in France.</p>
  <p>Everything was ready there, he explained, for the great political propaganda
  which he had planned and which could be commenced immediately.</p>
  <p>All that was needed now was the money. In what manner it would be needed
  and for what definite purpose he did not condescend to explain, nor did she
  care to ask. But she told him that she would be sole mistress of her fortune
  on the 2d of November, the date of her twenty-first birthday.</p>
  <p>After that he spoke no more of money, but promised to meet her at regular
  intervals during the six weeks which would intervene until the great day
  when she would be free to proclaim her marriage and place herself unreservedly
  in the hands of her husband.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
  The Absent Friend</b></h2>
  <p>The prince kept his word, and she was fairly free to see him at least once
  a week, somewhere within the leafy thicknesses of the park or in the woods,
  usually at the hour when dusk finally yields to the overwhelming embrace
  of night.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke was away. In London or Canterbury, she could not say, but
  she had scarcely seen him since that terrible time, when he came back from
  town having left Richard Lambert languishing in disgrace and in prison.</p>
  <p>Oh! how she missed the silent and thoughtful friend who in those days of
  pride and of joy had angered her so, because he seemed to stand for conscience
  and for prudence, when she only thought of happiness and of love.</p>
  <p>There was an almost humiliating isolation about her now. Nobody seemed to
  care whither she went, nor when she came home. Mistress de Chavasse talked
  from time to time about Sue&rsquo;s infatuation for the mysterious foreign
  adventurer, but always as if this were a thing of the past, and from which
  Sue herself had long since recovered.</p>
  <p>Thus there was no one to say her nay, when she went out into the garden
  after evening repast, and stayed there until the shades of night had long
  since wrapped the old trees in gloom.</p>
  <p>And strangely enough this sense of freedom struck her with a chill sense
  of loneliness. She would have loved to suddenly catch sight of Lambert&rsquo;s
  watchful figure, and to hear his somewhat harsh voice, warning her against
  the foreigner.</p>
  <p>This had been wont to irritate her twelve weeks ago. How mysteriously everything
  had altered round her!</p>
  <p>And yearning for her friend, she wondered what had become of him. The last
  she had heard was toward the middle of October when Sir Marmaduke, home from
  one of his frequent journeyings, one day said that Lambert had been released
  after ten weeks spent in prison, but that he could not say whither he had
  gone since then.</p>
  <p>All Sue&rsquo;s questionings anent the young man only brought forth violent
  vituperations from Sir Marmaduke, and cold words of condemnation from Mistress
  de Chavasse; therefore, she soon desisted, storing up in her heart pathetic
  memories of the one true friend she had in the world.</p>
  <p>She saw without much excitement, and certainly without tremor, the rapid
  advance of that date early in November when she would perforce have to leave
  Acol Court in order to follow her husband whithersoever he chose to command
  her.</p>
  <p>The last time that they had met there had been a good deal of talk between
  them, about her fortune and its future disposal. He declared himself ready
  to administer it all himself, as he professed a distrust of those who had
  watched over it so far&mdash;Master Skyffington, the lawyer, and Sir Marmaduke
  de Chavasse, both under the control of the Court of Chancery.</p>
  <p>She explained to him that the bulk of her wealth consisted of obligations
  and shares in the Levant and Russian Companies, her mother having been the
  only daughter and heiress of Peter Ford the great Levantine and Oriental
  merchant; her marriage with the proud Earl of Dover having caused no small
  measure of comment in Court circles in those days.</p>
  <p>There were also deeds of property owned in Holland, grants of monopolies
  for trading given by Ivan the Terrible to her grandfather, and receipts for
  moneys deposited in the great banks of Amsterdam and Vienna. Master Skyffington
  had charge of all those papers now: they represented nearly five hundred
  thousand pounds of money and she told her husband that they would all be
  placed in her own keeping, the day she was of age.</p>
  <p>He appeared to lend an inattentive ear to all these explanations, which
  she gave in those timid tones, which had lately become habitual to her, but
  once&mdash;when she made a slip, and talked about a share which she possessed
  in the Russian Company being worth &pound;50,000, he corrected her and said
  it was a good deal more, and gave her some explanations as to the real distribution
  of her capital, which astonished her by their lucidity and left her vaguely
  wondering how it happened that he knew. She had finally to promise to come
  to him at the cottage in Acol on the 2d of November&mdash;her twenty-first
  birthday&mdash;directly after her interview with the lawyer and with her
  guardian, and having obtained possession of all the share papers, the obligations,
  the grants of monopolies and the receipts from the Amsterdam and Vienna banks,
  to forthwith bring them over to the cottage and place them unreservedly in
  her husband&rsquo;s hands.</p>
  <p>And she would in her simplicity and ignorance gladly have given every scrap
  of paper&mdash;now in Master Skyffington&rsquo;s charge&mdash;in exchange
  for a return of those happy illusions which had surrounded the early history
  of her love with a halo of romance. She would have given this mysterious
  prince, now her husband, all the money that he wanted for this wonderful &ldquo;great
  work&rdquo; of his, if he would but give her back some of that enthusiastic
  belief in him which had so mysteriously been killed within her, that fateful
  moment in the vestry at Dover.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
  November The 2d</b></h2>
  <p>A dreary day, with a leaden sky overhead and the monotonous patter of incessant
  rain against the window panes.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse had just come downstairs, and opening the door
  which lead from the hall to the small withdrawing-room on the right, he saw
  Mistress de Chavasse, half-sitting, half-crouching in one of the stiff-backed
  chairs, which she had drawn close to the fire.</p>
  <p>There was a cheerful blaze on the hearth, and the room itself&mdash;being
  small&mdash;always looked cozier than any other at Acol Court.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, Editha&rsquo;s face was pallid and drawn, and she stared into
  the fire with eyes which seemed aglow with anxiety and even with fear. Her
  cloak was tied loosely about her shoulders, and at sight of Sir Marmaduke
  she started, then rising hurriedly, she put her hood over her head, and went
  towards the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! my dear Editha!&rdquo; quoth her brother-in-law, lightly greeting
  her, &ldquo;up betimes like the lark I see.... Are you going without?&rdquo; he
  added as she made a rapid movement to brush past him and once more made for
  the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she replied dully, &ldquo;I must fain move about ...
  tire myself out if I can ... I am consumed with anxiety.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; he retorted blandly, &ldquo;why should you be anxious?
  Everything is going splendidly ... and to-night at the latest a fortune of
  nigh on &pound;500,000 will be placed in my hands by a fond and adoring woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He caught the glitter in her eyes, that suggestion of power and of unspoken
  threats which she had adopted since the episode in the Bath Street house.
  For an instant an ugly frown further disfigured his sour face: but this frown
  was only momentary, it soon gave way to a suave smile. He took her hand and
  lightly touched it with his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After which, my dear Editha,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall be able
  to fulfill those obligations, which my heart originally dictated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She seemed satisfied at this assurance, for she now spoke in less aggressive
  tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you so sure of the girl, Marmaduke?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; he replied, his thoughts reverting to a day spent
  at Dover nearly three months ago, when a knot was tied of which fair Editha
  was not aware, but which rendered Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse very sure of
  a fortune.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet you have oft told me that Sue&rsquo;s love for her mysterious
  prince had vastly cooled of late!&rdquo; urged Editha still anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why yes! forsooth!&rdquo; he retorted grimly, &ldquo;Sue&rsquo;s
  sentimental fancy for the romantic exile hath gone the way of all such unreasoning
  attachments; but she has ventured too far to draw back.... And she will not
  draw back,&rdquo; he concluded significantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have a care, Marmaduke! ... the girl is more willful than ye wot
  of.... You may strain at a cord until it snap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; he said, with a shrug of his wide shoulders, &ldquo;you
  are suffering from vapors, my dear Editha ... or you would grant me more
  knowledge of how to conduct mine own affairs.... Do you remember, perchance,
  that the bulk of Sue&rsquo;s fortune will be handed over to her this day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! I remember!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Begad, then to-night I&rsquo;ll have that bulk out of her hands.
  You may take an oath on that!&rdquo; he declared savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And afterwards?&rdquo; she asked simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes ... afterwards? ... when Sue has discovered how she has been
  tricked? ... Are you not afraid of what she might do? ... Even though her
  money may pass into your hands ... even though you may inveigle her into
  a clandestine marriage ... she is still the daughter of the late Earl of
  Dover ... she has landed estates, wealth, rich and powerful relations....
  There must be an &lsquo;afterwards,&rsquo; remember! ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His ironical laugh grated on her nerves, as he replied lightly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw! my dear Editha! of a truth you are not your own calm self
  to-day, else you had understood that forsooth! in the love affairs of Prince
  Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans and Lady Susannah Aldmarshe there
  must and can be no &lsquo;afterwards.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet, &rsquo;tis simple enough. Sue is my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your wife! ...&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush! An you want to scream, I pray you question me not, for what
  I say is bound to startle you. Sue is my wife. I married her, having obtained
  a special license to do so in the name of Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; Henri
  d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans, and all the rest of the romantic paraphernalia. She
  is my wife, and therefore, her money and fortune are mine, every penny of
  it, without question or demur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She will appeal to the Court to have the marriage annulled ... she&rsquo;ll
  rouse public indignation against you to such a pitch that you&rsquo;ll not
  be able to look one of your kith and kin in the face.... The whole shameful
  story of the mysterious French prince ... your tricks to win the hand of
  your ward by lying, cheating and willful deceit will resound from one end
  of the country to the other.... What is the use of a mint of money if you
  have to herd with outcasts, and not an honest man will shake you by the hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None, my dear Editha, none,&rdquo; he replied quietly, &ldquo;and &rsquo;tis
  of still less use for you to rack your nerves in order to place before me
  a gruesome picture of the miserable social pariah which I should become,
  if the story of my impersonation of a romantic exile for the purpose of capturing
  the hand of my ward came to the ears of those in authority.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whither it doubtless would come!&rdquo; she affirmed hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whither it doubtless would come,&rdquo; he assented, &ldquo;and therefore,
  my dear Editha, once the money is safely in my hands I will leave her Royal
  Highness the Princesse d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans in full possession, not only
  of her landed estates but of the freedom conferred on her by widowhood, for
  Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute;, her husband, will vanish like the beautiful dream
  which he always was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how? ... how?&rdquo; she reiterated, puzzled, anxious, scenting
  some nefarious scheme more unavowable even than the last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! time will show! ... But he will vanish, my dear Editha, take
  my word on it. Shall we say that he will fly up into the clouds and her Highness
  the Princess will know him no more?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why have married her?&rdquo; she exclaimed: some womanly instinct
  within her crying out against this outrage. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas cruel and
  unnecessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cruel perhaps! ... But surely no more than necessary. I doubt if
  she would have entrusted her fortune to anyone but her husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had she ceased to trust her romantic prince then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps. At any rate, I chose to make sure of the prize.... I have
  worked hard to get it and would not fail for lack of a simple ceremony ...
  moreover ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Moreover?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Moreover, my dear Editha, there is always the possibility ... remote,
  no doubt ... but nevertheless tangible ... that at some time or other ...
  soon or late&mdash;who knows?&mdash;the little deception practiced on Lady
  Sue may come to the light of day.... In that case, even if the marriage be
  annulled on the ground of fraud ... which methinks is more than doubtful
  ... no one could deny my right as the heiress&rsquo;s ... hem ... shall we
  say?&mdash;temporary husband&mdash;to dispose of her wealth as I thought
  fit. If I am to become a pariah and an outcast, as you so eloquently suggested
  just now ... I much prefer being a rich one.... With half a million in the
  pocket of my doublet the whole world is open to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was so much cool calculation, such callous contempt for the feelings
  and thoughts of the unfortunate girl whom he had so terribly wronged, in
  this expos&eacute; of the situation, that Mistress de Chavasse herself was
  conscious of a sense of repulsion from the man whom she had aided hitherto.</p>
  <p>She believed that she held him sufficiently in her power, through her knowledge
  of his schemes and through the help which she was rendering him, to extract
  a promise from him that he would share his ill-gotten spoils in equal portions
  with her. At one time after the fracas in Bath Street, he had even given
  her a vague promise of marriage; therefore, he had kept secret from her the
  relation of that day spent at Dover. Now she felt that even if he were free,
  she would never consent to link her future irretrievably with his.</p>
  <p>But her share of the money she meant to have. She was tired of poverty,
  tired of planning and scheming, of debt and humiliation. She was tired of
  her life of dependence at Acol Court, and felt a sufficiency of youth and
  buoyancy in herself yet, to enjoy a final decade of luxury and amusement
  in London.</p>
  <p>Therefore, she closed her ears to every call of conscience, she shut her
  heart against the lonely young girl who so sadly needed the counsels and
  protection of a good woman, and she was quite ready to lend a helping hand
  to Sir Marmaduke, at least until a goodly share of Lady Sue&rsquo;s fortune
  was safely within her grasp.</p>
  <p>One point occurred to her now, which caused her to ask anxiously:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you not made your reckonings without Richard Lambert, Marmaduke?
  He is back in these parts, you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he ejaculated, with a quick scowl of impatience. &ldquo;He
  has returned?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! Charity was my informant. He looks very ill, so the wench says:
  he has been down with fever, it appears, all the while that he was in prison,
  and was only discharged because they feared that he would die. He contrived
  to work or beg his way back here, and now he is staying in the village....
  I thought you would have heard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! I never speak to the old woman ... and Adam Lambert avoids me
  as he would the plague.... I see as little of them as I can.... I had to
  be prudent these last, final days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heaven grant he may do nothing fatal to-day!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! my dear Editha,&rdquo; he retorted with a harsh laugh, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
  scarcely Heaven&rsquo;s business to look after our schemes. But Lambert can
  do us very little harm now! For his own sake, he will keep out of Sue&rsquo;s
  way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At what hour does Master Skyffington arrive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as he saw that she was putting into effect her former resolve of going
  out, despite the rain, and was once more readjusting her hood for that purpose,
  he opened the door for her, and whispered as he followed her out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An you will allow me, my dear Editha, I&rsquo;ll accompany you on
  your walk ... we might push on down the Canterbury Road, and perchance meet
  Master Skyffington.... I understand that Sue has been asking for me, and
  I would prefer to meet her as seldom as possible just now.... This is my
  last day,&rdquo; he concluded with a laugh, &ldquo;and I must be doubly careful.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
  An Interlude</b></h2>
  <p>Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy was vastly perturbed. Try how he might, he had
  been unable to make any discovery with regard to the mysterious events, which
  he felt sure were occurring all round him, a discovery which&mdash;had he
  but made it&mdash;would have enabled him to apply with more chance of success,
  for one of the posts in my Lord Protector&rsquo;s secret service, and moreover,
  would have covered his name with glory.</p>
  <p>This last contingency was always uppermost in his mind. Not from any feeling
  of personal pride, for of a truth vanity is a mortal sin, but because Mistress
  Charity had of late cast uncommonly kind eyes on that cringing worm, Master
  Courage Toogood, and the latter, emboldened by the minx&rsquo;s favors, had
  been more than usually insolent to his betters.</p>
  <p>To have the right to administer serious physical punishment to the youth,
  and moral reproof to the wench, was part of Master Busy&rsquo;s comprehensive
  scheme for his own advancement and the confusion of all the miscreants who
  dwelt in Acol Court. For this he had glued both eye and ear to draughty keyholes,
  had lain for hours under cover of prickly thistles in the sunk fence which
  surrounded the flower garden. For this he now emerged, on that morning of
  November 2, accompanied by a terrific clatter and a volley of soot from out
  the depth of the monumental chimney in the hall of Acol Court.</p>
  <p>As soon as he had recovered sufficient breath, and shaken off some of the
  soot from his hair and face, he looked solemnly about him, and was confronted
  by two pairs of eyes round with astonishment and two mouths agape with surprise
  and with fear.</p>
  <p>Mistress Charity and Master Courage Toogood&mdash;interrupted in the midst
  of their animated conversation&mdash;were now speechless with terror, at
  sight of this black apparition, which, literally, had descended on them from
  the skies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lud love ye, Master Busy!&rdquo; ejaculated Mistress Charity, who
  was the first to recognize in the sooty wraith the manly form of her betrothed, &ldquo;where
  have ye come from, pray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you been scouring the chimney, good master?&rdquo; queried Master
  Courage, with some diffidence, for the saintly man looked somewhat out of
  humor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied Hymn-of-Praise solemnly, &ldquo;I have not. But
  I tell ye both that my hour hath come. I knew that something was happening
  in this house, and I climbed up that chimney in order to find out what it
  was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pardonable curiosity caused Mistress Charity to venture a little nearer
  to the soot-covered figure of her adorer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And did you hear anything, Master Busy?&rdquo; she asked eagerly. &ldquo;I
  did see Sir Marmaduke and the mistress in close conversation here this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So they thought,&rdquo; said Master Hymn-of-Praise with weird significance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well? ... And what happened, good master?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou beest in too mighty an hurry, mistress,&rdquo; he retorted with
  quiet dignity. &ldquo;I am under no obligation to report matters to thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! but Master Busy,&rdquo; she rejoined coyly, &ldquo;methought
  I was to be your ... hem ... thy partner in life ... and so ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My partner? My partner, didst thou say, sweet Charity? ... Nay, then,
  an thou&rsquo;lt permit me to salute thee with a kiss, I&rsquo;ll tell thee
  all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And in asking for that chaste salute we may assume that Master Hymn-of-Praise
  was actuated with at least an equal desire to please Mistress Charity, to
  gratify his own wishes, and to effectually annoy Master Courage.</p>
  <p>But Mistress Charity was actuated by curiosity alone, and without thought
  of her betrothed&rsquo;s grimy appearance, she presented her cheek to him
  for the kiss.</p>
  <p>The result caused Master Courage an uncontrollable fit of hilarity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, mistress,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the black imprint left
  on her face by her lover&rsquo;s kiss, &ldquo;you should gaze into a mirror
  now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But already Mistress Charity had guessed what had occurred, her good humor
  vanished, and she began scouring her cheek with her pinner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forgive you, master,&rdquo; she said crossly. &ldquo;You
  had no right to ... hem ... with your face in that condition.... And you
  have not yet told us what happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! you promised to tell me if I allowed you to kiss me. &rsquo;Tis
  done....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I well nigh broke my back,&rdquo; said Master Busy sententiously. &ldquo;I
  hurt my knee ... that is what happened.... I am well-nigh choked with soot....
  Ugh! ... that is what happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lud love you, Master Busy,&rdquo; she retorted with a saucy toss
  of her head, &ldquo;I trust your life&rsquo;s partner will not need to hide
  herself in chimneys.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen, wench, and I&rsquo;ll tell thee. No kind of servant of my
  Lord Protector&rsquo;s should ever be called upon to hide in chimneys. They
  are not comfortable and they are not clean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless the man!&rdquo; she cried angrily, &ldquo;are you ever going
  to tell us what did happen whilst you were there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was about to come to that point,&rdquo; he said imperturbably, &ldquo;hadst
  thou not interrupted me. What with holding on so as not to fall, and the
  soot falling in my ears....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! aye! ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard nothing,&rdquo; he concluded solemnly. &ldquo;Master Courage,&rdquo; he
  added with becoming severity, seeing that the youth was on the verge of making
  a ribald remark, which of necessity had to be checked betimes, &ldquo;come
  into my room with me and help me to clean the traces of my difficult task
  from off my person. Come!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with ominous significance, he approached the young scoffer, his hand
  on an exact level with the latter&rsquo;s ear, his right foot raised to indicate
  a possible means of enforcing obedience to his commands.</p>
  <p>On the whole, Master Courage thought it wise to repress both his hilarity
  and his pertinent remarks, and to follow the pompous, if begrimed, butler
  to the latter&rsquo;s room upstairs.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
  The Outcast</b></h2>
  <p>It took Mistress Charity some little time to recover her breath.</p>
  <p>She had thrown herself into a chair, with her pinner over her face, in an
  uncontrollable fit of laughter.</p>
  <p>When this outburst of hilarity had subsided, she sat up, and looked round
  her with eyes still streaming with merry tears.</p>
  <p>But the laughter suddenly died on her lips and the merriment out of her
  eyes. A dull, tired voice had just said feebly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse within?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Charity jumped up from the chair and stared stupidly at the speaker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Lord love you, Master Richard Lambert,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I
  thought you were your ghost!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgive me, mistress, if I have frightened you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
  is mine own self, I give you assurance of that, and I, fain would have speech
  with Sir Marmaduke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mistress Charity was visibly embarrassed. She began mechanically to rub
  the black stain on her cheek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir Marmaduke is without just at present, Master Lambert,&rdquo; she
  stammered shyly, &ldquo;... and ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes? ... and? ...&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what is it, wench? ...
  speak out? ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir Marmaduke gave orders, Master Lambert,&rdquo; she began with
  obvious reluctance, &ldquo;that ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused, and he concluded the sentence for her:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I was not to be allowed inside his house.... Was that it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas! yes, good master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, girl,&rdquo; he rejoined as he deliberately crossed the
  hall and sat down in the chair which she had just vacated. &ldquo;You have
  done your duty: but you could not help admitting me, could you? since I walked
  in of mine own accord ... and now that I am here I will remain until I have
  seen Sir Marmaduke....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! of a truth, good master,&rdquo; she said with a smile, for &rsquo;twas
  but natural that her feminine sympathies should be on the side of a young
  and good-looking man, somewhat in her own sphere of life, as against the
  ill-humored, parsimonious master whom she served, &ldquo;an you sit there
  so determinedly, I cannot prevent you, can I? ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as she perceived the look of misery on the young man&rsquo;s face,
  his pale cheeks, his otherwise vigorous frame obviously attenuated by fear,
  the motherly instinct present in every good woman&rsquo;s heart caused her
  to go up to him and to address him timidly, offering such humble solace as
  her simple heart could dictate:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lud preserve you, good master, I pray you do not take on so.... You
  know Master Courage and I, now, never believed all those stories about ye.
  Of a truth Master Busy, he had his own views, but then ... you see, good
  master, he and I do not always agree, even though I own that he is vastly
  clever with his discoveries and his clews; but Master Courage now ... Master
  Courage is a wonderful lad ... and he thinks that you are a persecuted hero!
  ... and I am bound to say that I, too, hold that view....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you! ... thank you, kind mistress,&rdquo; said Lambert, smiling
  despite his dejection, at the girl&rsquo;s impulsive efforts at consolation.</p>
  <p>His head had sunk down on his breast, and he sat there in the high-backed
  chair, one hand resting on each leather-covered arm, his pale face showing
  almost ghostlike against the dark background, and with the faint November
  light illumining the dark-circled eyes, the bloodless lips, and deeply frowning
  brow.</p>
  <p>Mistress Charity gazed down on him with mute and kindly compassion.</p>
  <p>Then suddenly a slight rustling noise as of a kirtle sweeping the polished
  oak of the stairs caused the girl to look up, then to pause a brief while,
  as if what she had now seen had brought forth a new train of thought; finally,
  she tiptoed silently out through the door of the dining-hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Charity! Mistress Charity, I want you! ...&rdquo; called Lady Sue
  from above.</p>
  <p>We must presume, however, that the wench had closed the heavy door behind
  her, for certainly she did not come in answer to the call. On the other hand,
  Richard Lambert had heard it; he sprang to his feet and saw Sue descending
  the stairs.</p>
  <p>She saw him, too, and it seemed as if at sight of him she had turned and
  meant to fly. But a word from him detained her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sue!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Only once had he thus called her by her name before, that long ago night
  in the woods, but now the cry came from out his heart, brought forth by his
  misery and his sorrow, his sense of terrible injustice and of an irretrievable
  wrong.</p>
  <p>It never occurred to her to resent the familiarity. At sound of her name
  thus spoken by him she had looked down from the stairs and seen his pallid
  face turned up to her in such heartrending appeal for sympathy, that all
  her womanly instincts of tenderness and pity were aroused, all her old feeling
  of trustful friendship for him.</p>
  <p>She, too, felt much of that loneliness which his yearning eyes expressed
  so pathetically; she, too, was conscious of grave injustice and of an irretrievable
  wrong, and her heart went out to him immediately in kindness and in love.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, for pity&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; he added entreatingly,
  for he thought that she meant to turn away from him; &ldquo;surely you will
  not begrudge me a few words of kindness. I have gone through a great deal
  since I saw you....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She descended a few steps, her delicate hand still resting on the banisters,
  her silken kirtle making a soft swishing noise against the polished oak of
  the stairs. It was a solace to him, even to watch her now. The sight of his
  adored mistress was balm to his aching eyes. Yet he was quick to note&mdash;with
  that sharp intuition peculiar to Love&mdash;that her dear face had lost much
  of its brightness, of its youth, of its joy of living. She was as exquisite
  to look on as ever, but she seemed older, more gentle, and, alas! a trifle
  sad.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard you had been ill,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;I was very
  sorry, believe me, but ... Oh! do you not think,&rdquo; she added with sudden
  inexplicable pathos, whilst she felt hot tears rising to her eyes and causing
  her voice to quiver, &ldquo;do you not think that an interview between us
  now can only be painful to us both?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He mistook the intention of her words, as was only natural, and whilst she
  mistrusted her own feelings for him, fearing to betray that yearning for
  his friendship and his consolation, which had so suddenly overwhelmed her
  at sight of him, he thought that she feared the interview because of her
  condemnation of him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you believed me guilty?&rdquo; he said sadly. &ldquo;They told
  you this hideous tale of me, and you believed them, without giving the absent
  one, who alas! could not speak in his own defense, the benefit of the doubt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For one of those subtle reasons of which women alone possess the secret,
  and which will forever remain inexplicable to the more logical sex, she steeled
  her heart against him, even when her entire sensibilities went out to him
  in passionate sympathy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I could not help but believe, good master,&rdquo; she said a little
  coldly. &ldquo;Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, who, with all his faults of temper,
  is a man of honor, confirmed that horrible story which appeared in the newspaper
  and of which everyone in Thanet hath been talking these weeks past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And am <i>I</i> not a man of honor?&rdquo; he retorted hotly. &ldquo;Because
  I am poor and must work in order to live, am <i>I</i> to be condemned unheard?
  Is a whole life&rsquo;s record of self-education and honest labor to be thus
  obliterated by the word of my most bitter enemy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your bitter enemy? ...&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Sir Marmaduke? ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse. It seems passing strange, does it
  not?&rdquo; he rejoined bitterly. &ldquo;Yet somehow in my heart, I feel
  that Sir Marmaduke hates me, with a violent and passionate hatred. Nay! I
  know it, though I can explain neither its cause nor its ultimate aim....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He drew nearer to the stairs whereon she still stood, her graceful figure
  slightly leaning towards him; he now stood close to her, his head just below
  the level of her own; his hand had he dared to raise it, could have rested
  on hers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sue! my beautiful and worshiped lady,&rdquo; he cried impassionedly, &ldquo;I
  entreat you to look into my eyes! ... Can you see in them the reflex of those
  shameful deeds which have been imputed to me? Do I look like a liar and a
  cheat? In the name of pity and of justice, for the sweet sake of our first
  days of friendship, I beg of you not to condemn me unheard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He lowered his head, and rested his aching brow against her cool, white
  hand. She did not withdraw it, for a great joy had suddenly filled her heart,
  mingling with its sadness, a sense of security and of bitter, yet real, happiness
  pervaded her whole being: a happiness which she could not&mdash;wished not&mdash;to
  explain, but which prompted her to stoop yet further towards him, and to
  touch his hair with her lips.</p>
  <p>Hot tears which he tried vainly to repress fell upon her fingers. He had
  felt the kiss descending on him almost like a benediction. The exquisite
  fragrance of her person filled his soul with a great delight which was almost
  pain. Never had he loved her so ardently, so passionately, as at this moment,
  when he felt that she too loved him, and yet was lost to him irrevocably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! but I will hear you, good master,&rdquo; she murmured with infinite
  gentleness, &ldquo;for the sake of that friendship, and because now that
  I have seen you again I no longer believe any evil of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God bless my dear lady,&rdquo; he replied fervently. &ldquo;Heaven
  is my witness that I am innocent of those abominable crimes imputed to me.
  Sir Marmaduke took me to that house of evil, and a cruel plot was there concocted
  to make me appear before all men as a liar and a cheat, and to disgrace me
  before the world and before you. That the object of this plot was to part
  me from you,&rdquo; added Richard Lambert more calmly and firmly, &ldquo;I
  am absolutely confident; what its deeper motive was I dare not even think.
  It was known that I ... loved you, Sue ... that I would give my life to save
  you from trouble ... I was your slave, your watch-dog.... I was forcibly
  removed, torn from you, my name disgraced, my health broken down.... But
  my life was not for them ... it belongs to my lady alone.... Heaven would
  not allow it to be sacrificed to their villainous schemes. I fought against
  sickness and death with all the energy of despair.... It was a hand-to-hand
  fight, for discouragement, and anon despair, ranged themselves among my foes....
  And now I have come back,&rdquo; he said with proud energy, &ldquo;broken
  mayhap, yet still standing ... a snapped oak yet full of vigor, yet ... I
  have come back, and with God&rsquo;s help will be even with them yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had straightened his young figure, and his strong, somewhat harsh voice
  echoed through the oak-paneled hall. He cared not if all the world heard
  him, if his enemies lurked about striving to spy upon him. His profession
  of love and of service to his lady was the sole remaining pride of his life,
  and now that he knew that she believed and trusted him, he longed for every
  man to hear what he had to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! what you say, kind Richard, fills me with dread,&rdquo; said
  Sue after a little pause. &ldquo;I am glad ... glad that you have come back....
  For some weeks, nay, months past, I have had the presentiment of some coming
  evil.... I have ... I have felt lonely and....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not unhappy?&rdquo; he asked with his usual earnestness. &ldquo;I
  would not have my lady unhappy for all the treasures of this world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she replied meditatively, striving to be conscious of
  her own feelings, &ldquo;I do not think that I am unhappy ... only anxious
  ... and ... a little lonely: that is all.... Sir Marmaduke is oft away: when
  he is at home, I scarce ever see him, and he but rarely speaks to me ...
  and methinks there is but scant sympathy &rsquo;twixt Mistress de Chavasse
  and me, though she is kind at times in her way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she turned her eyes, bright with unshed tears, down again to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But all seems right again!&rdquo; she said with a sweet, sad smile, &ldquo;now
  that you have come back, my dear ... dear friend!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God bless you for these words!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I grieved terribly when I heard ... about you ... at first ...&rdquo; she
  said almost gaily now, &ldquo;yet somehow I could not believe it all ...
  and now....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes? ... and now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now I believe in you,&rdquo; she replied simply. &ldquo;I believe
  that you care for me, and that you are my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your friend, indeed, for I would give my life for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more he stooped, but now he kissed her hand. He was her friend, and
  had the right to do this. He had gradually mastered his emotion, his sense
  of wrong, and with that exquisite selflessness which real love alone can
  kindle in a human heart, he had succeeded in putting aside all thought of
  his own great misery, his helplessness and the hopelessness of his position,
  and remembered only that she looked fragile, a little older, sadder, and
  had need of his help.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now, sweet lady,&rdquo; he said, forcing himself to speak calmly
  of that which always set his heart and senses into a turmoil of passionate
  jealousy, &ldquo;will you tell me something about him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The prince....&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
  <p>But she shook her head resolutely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, kind Richard,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;I will not speak
  to you of the prince. I know that you do not think well of him.... I wish
  to look upon you as my friend, and I could not do that if you spoke ill of
  him, because ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused, for what she now had to tell him was very hard to say, and she
  knew what a terrible blow she would be dealing to his heart, from the wild
  beating of her own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Because? ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because he is my husband,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>Her head fell forward on her breast. She would not trust herself to look
  at him now, for she knew that the sight of his grief was more than she could
  bear. She was conscious that at her words he had drawn his hand away from
  hers, but he spoke no word, nor did the faintest exclamation escape his lips.</p>
  <p>Thus they remained for a few moments longer side by side: she slightly above
  him, with head bent, with hot tears falling slowly from her downcast eyes,
  her heart well-nigh breaking with the consciousness of the irreparable; he
  somewhat below, silent too, and rigid, all passion, all emotion, love even,
  numbed momentarily by the violence, the suddenness of this terrible blow.</p>
  <p>Then without a word, without a sigh or look, he turned, and she heard his
  footsteps echoing across the hall, then dying away on the threshold of the
  door beyond. Anon the door itself closed to with a dull bang which seemed
  to find an echo in her heart like the tolling of a passing bell.</p>
  <p>Then only did she raise her head, and look about her. The hall was deserted
  and seemed infinitely lonely, silent, and grim. The young girl-wife, who
  had just found a friend only to lose him again, called out in mute appeal
  to this old house, the oak-covered walls, the very stones themselves, for
  sympathy.</p>
  <p>She was so infinitely, so immeasurably lonely, with that awful, irretrievable
  day at Dover behind her, with all its dreariness, its silent solemnity, its
  weird finish in the vestry, the ring upon her finger, her troth plighted
  to a man whom she feared and no longer loved.</p>
  <p>Oh! the pity of it all! the broken young life! the vanished dreams!</p>
  <p>Sue bent her head down upon her hands, her lips touched her own fingers
  there where her friend&rsquo;s had rested in gratitude and love, and she
  cried, cried like a broken-hearted woman, cried for her lost illusions, and
  the end of her brief romance!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter27"></a>Chapter 27<br>
  Lady Sue&rsquo;s Fortune</b></h2>
  <p>Less than an hour later four people were assembled in the small withdrawing-room
  of Acol Court.</p>
  <p>Master Skyffington sat behind a central table, a little pompous of manner,
  clad in sober black with well-starched linen cuffs and collar, his scanty
  hair closely cropped, his thin hands fingering with assurance and perfect
  calm the various documents laid out before him. Near him Sir Marmaduke de
  Chavasse, sitting with his back to the dim November light, which vainly strove
  to penetrate the tiny glass panes of the casement windows.</p>
  <p>In a more remote corner of the room sat Editha de Chavasse, vainly trying
  to conceal the agitation which her trembling hands, her quivering face and
  restless eyes persistently betrayed. And beside the central table, near Master
  Skyffington and facing Sir Marmaduke, was Lady Susannah Aldmarshe, only daughter
  and heiress of the late Earl of Dover, this day aged twenty-one years, and
  about to receive from the hands of her legal guardians the vast fortune which
  her father had bequeathed to her, and which was to become absolutely hers
  this day to dispose of as she list.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now, my dear child,&rdquo; said Master Skyffington with due solemnity,
  when he had disposed a number of documents and papers in methodical order
  upon the table, &ldquo;let me briefly explain to you the object ... hem ...
  of this momentous meeting here to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am all attention, master,&rdquo; said Sue vaguely, and her eyes
  wide-open, obviously absent, she gazed fixedly on the silhouette of Sir Marmaduke,
  grimly outlined against the grayish window-panes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must tell you, my dear child,&rdquo; resumed Master Skyffington
  after a slight pause, during which he had studied with vague puzzledom the
  inscrutable face of the young girl, &ldquo;I must tell you that your late
  father, the noble Earl of Dover, had married the heiress of Peter Ford, the
  wealthiest merchant this country hath ever known. She was your own lamented
  mother, and the whole of her fortune, passing through her husband&rsquo;s
  hands, hath now devolved upon you. My much-esteemed patron&mdash;I may venture
  to say friend&mdash;Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, having been appointed your
  legal guardian by the Court of Chancery, and I myself being thereupon named
  the repository of your securities, these have been administered by me up
  to now.... You are listening to me, are you not, my dear young lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The question was indeed necessary, for even to Master Skyffington&rsquo;s
  unobservant mind it was apparent that Sue&rsquo;s eyes had a look of aloofness
  in them, of detachment from her surroundings, which was altogether inexplicable
  to the worthy attorney&rsquo;s practical sense of the due fitness of things.</p>
  <p>At his query she made a sudden effort to bring her thoughts back from the
  past to the present, to drag her heart and her aching brain away from that
  half-hour spent in the hall, from that conversation with her friend, from
  the recollection of that terribly cruel blow which she had been forced to
  deal to the man who loved her best in all the world.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, kind master,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am listening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And she fixed her eyes resolutely on the attorney&rsquo;s solemn face, forcing
  her mind to grasp what he was about to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the terms of your noble father&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; continued
  Master Skyffington, as soon as he had satisfied himself that he at last held
  the heiress&rsquo;s attention, &ldquo;the securities, receipts and all other
  moneys are to be given over absolutely and unconditionally into your own
  hands on your twenty-first birthday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which is to-day,&rdquo; said Sue simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which is to-day,&rdquo; assented the lawyer. &ldquo;The securities,
  receipts and other bonds, grants of monopolies and so forth lie before you
  on this table.... They represent in value over half a million of English
  money.... A very large sum indeed for so young a girl to have full control
  of.... Nevertheless, it is yours absolutely and unconditionally, according
  to the wishes of your late noble father ... and Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse,
  your late guardian, and I myself, have met you here this day for the express
  purpose of handing these securities, grants and receipts over to you, and
  to obtain in exchange your own properly attested signature in full discharge
  of any further obligation on our part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Master Skyffington was earnestly gazing into the young girl&rsquo;s face,
  whilst he thus literally dangled before her the golden treasures of wealth,
  which were about to become absolutely her own. He thought, not unnaturally,
  that a girl of her tender years, brought up in the loneliness and seclusion
  of a not too luxurious home, would feel in a measure dazzled and certainly
  overjoyed at the brilliant prospect which such independent and enormous wealth
  opened out before her.</p>
  <p>But the amiable attorney was vastly disappointed to see neither pleasure,
  nor even interest, expressed in Lady Sue&rsquo;s face, which on this joyous
  and momentous occasion looked unnaturally calm and pallid. Even now when
  he paused expectant and eager, waiting for some comment or exclamation of
  approval or joy from her, she was silent for a while, and then said in a
  stolidly inquiring tone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then after to-day ... I shall have full control of my money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absolute control, my dear young lady,&rdquo; he rejoined, feeling
  strangely perturbed at this absence of emotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And no one ... after to-day ... will have the right to inquire as
  to the use I make of these securities, grants or whatever you, Master Skyffington,
  have called them?&rdquo; she continued with the same placidity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one, of a surety, my dear Sue,&rdquo; here interposed Sir Marmaduke,
  speaking in his usual harsh and dictatorial way, &ldquo;but this is a strange
  and somewhat peremptory question for a young maid to put at this juncture.
  Master Skyffington and I myself had hoped that you would listen to counsels
  of prudence, and would allow him, who hath already administered your fortune
  in a vastly able manner, to continue so to do, for a while at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That question we can discuss later on, Sir Marmaduke,&rdquo; said
  Sue now, with sudden hauteur. &ldquo;Shall we proceed with our business,
  master?&rdquo; she added, turning deliberately to the lawyer, ignoring with
  calm disdain the very presence of her late guardian.</p>
  <p>The studied contempt of his ward&rsquo;s manner, however, seemed not to
  disturb the serenity of Sir Marmaduke to any appreciable extent. Casting
  a quick, inquisitorial glance at Sue, he shrugged his shoulders in token
  of indifference and said no more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly,&rdquo; responded Master Skyffington, somewhat
  embarrassed, &ldquo;my dear young lady ... hem ... as ... er ... as you wish
  ... but ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he turned deliberately to Sir Marmaduke, once more bringing him into
  the proceedings, and tacitly condemning her ladyship&rsquo;s extraordinary
  attitude towards his distinguished patron.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Having now explained to Lady Sue Aldmarshe the terms of her noble
  father&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;methinks that she is ready to
  receive the moneys from our hands, good Sir Marmaduke, and thereupon to give
  us the proper receipt prescribed by law, for the same ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He checked himself for a moment, and then made a respectful, if pointed,
  suggestion:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mistress de Chavasse?&rdquo; he said inquiringly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mistress de Chavasse is a member of the family,&rdquo; replied Sir
  Marmaduke, &ldquo;the business can be transacted in her presence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing therefore remains to be said, my dear young lady,&rdquo; rejoined
  Master Skyffington, once more speaking directly to Sue and placing his lean
  hands with fingers outstretched, over the bundles of papers lying before
  him. &ldquo;Here are your securities, your grants, moneys and receipts, worth &pound;500,000
  of the present currency of this realm.... These I, in mine own name and that
  of my honored friend and patron, Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, do hereby hand
  over to you. You will, I pray, verify and sign the receipt in proper and
  due form.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He began sorting and overlooking the papers, muttering half audibly the
  while, as he transferred each bundle from his own side of the table to that
  beside which Lady Sue was sitting:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The deeds of property in Holland ... hem.... Receipt of moneys deposited
  at the bank of Amsterdam.... The same from the Bank of Vienna.... Grant of
  monopoly for the hemp trade in Russia.... hem ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus he mumbled for some time, as these papers, representing a fortune,
  passed out of his keeping into those of a young maid but recently out of
  her teens. Sue watched him silently and placidly, just as she had done throughout
  this momentous interview, which was, of a truth, the starting point of her
  independent life.</p>
  <p>Her face expressed neither joy nor excitement of any kind. She knew that
  all the wealth which now lay before her, would only pass briefly through
  her hands. She knew that the prince&mdash;her husband&mdash;was waiting for
  it even now. Doubtless, he was counting the hours when his young wife&rsquo;s
  vast fortune would come to him as the realization of all his dreams.</p>
  <p>In spite of her present disbelief in his love, in spite of the bitter knowledge
  that her own had waned, Sue had no misgivings as yet as to the honor, the
  truth, the loyalty of the man whose name she now bore. Her illusions were
  gone, her romance had become dull reality, but to one thought she clung with
  all the tenacity of despair, and that was to the illusion that Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans
  was the selfless patriot, the regenerator of downtrodden France, which he
  represented himself to be.</p>
  <p>Because of that belief she welcomed the wealth, which she would this day
  be able to place in his hands. Her own girlish dreams had vanished, but her
  temperament was far too romantic and too poetic not to recreate illusions,
  even when the old ones had been so ruthlessly shattered.</p>
  <p>But this recreation would occur anon&mdash;not just now, not at the very
  moment when her heart ached with an intolerable pain at thought of the sorrow
  which she had caused to her one friend. Presently, no doubt, when she met
  her husband, when his usual grandiloquent phrases had once more succeeded
  in arousing her enthusiasm for the cause which he pleaded, she would once
  more feel serene and happy at thought of the help which she, with her great
  wealth, would be giving him; for the nonce the whole transaction grated on
  her sense of romance; money passing from hand to hand, a man waiting somewhere
  in the dark to receive wealth from a woman&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>Master Skyffington desired her to look over the papers, ere she signed the
  formal receipt for them, but she waved them gently aside:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite unnecessary, kind master,&rdquo; she said decisively, &ldquo;since
  I receive them at your hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She bent over the document which the lawyer now placed before her, and took
  the pen from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where shall I sign?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke and Editha de Chavasse watched her keenly, as with a bold
  stroke of the pen she wrote her name across the receipt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now the papers, please, master,&rdquo; said Lady Sue peremptorily.</p>
  <p>But the prudent lawyer had still a word of protest to enter here.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; he said tentatively, awed in spite of
  himself by the self-possessed behavior of a maid whom up to now he had regarded
  as a mere child, &ldquo;let me, as a man of vast experience in such matters,
  repeat to you the well-meant advice which Sir Marmaduke ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she checked him decisively, though kindly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You said, Master Skyffington, did you not,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that
  after to-day no one had the slightest control over my actions or over my
  fortune?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is so, certainly,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;but ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, kind master, I pray you,&rdquo; she said authoritatively, &ldquo;to
  hand me over all those securities, grants and moneys, for which I have just
  signed a receipt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was naught to do for a punctilious lawyer, as was Master Skyffington,
  but to obey forthwith. This he did, without another word, collecting the
  various bundles of paper and placing them one by one in the brown leather
  wallet which he had brought for the purpose. Sue watched him quietly, and
  when the last of the important documents had been deposited in the wallet,
  she held out her hand for it.</p>
  <p>With a grave bow, and an unconsciously pompous gesture, Master Skyffington,
  attorney-at-law, handed over that wallet which now contained a fortune to
  Lady Susannah Aldmarshe.</p>
  <p>She took it, and graciously bowed her head to him in acknowledgment. Then,
  after a slight, distinctly haughty nod to Sir Marmaduke and to Editha, she
  turned and walked silently out of the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter28"></a>Chapter 28<br>
  Husband And Wife</b></h2>
  <p>Mistress Martha Lambert was a dignified old woman, on whose wrinkled face
  stern virtues, sedulously practiced, had left their lasting imprint. Among
  these virtues which she had thus somewhat ruthlessly exercised throughout
  her long life, cleanliness and orderliness stood out pre-eminently. They
  undoubtedly had brought some of the deepest furrows round her eyes and mouth,
  as indeed they had done round those of Adam Lambert, who having lived with
  her all his life, had had to suffer from her passion of scrubbing and tidying
  more than anyone else.</p>
  <p>But her cottage was resplendent: her chief virtues being apparent in every
  nook and corner of the orderly little rooms which formed her home and that
  of the two lads whom a dying friend had entrusted to her care.</p>
  <p>The parlor below, with its highly polished bits of furniture, its spotless
  wooden floor and whitewashed walls, was a miracle of cleanliness. The table
  in the center was laid with a snowy white cloth, on it the pewter candlesticks
  shone like antique silver. Two straight-backed mahogany chairs were drawn
  cozily near to the hearth, wherein burned a bright fire made up of ash logs.
  There was a quaint circular mirror in a gilt frame over the hearth, a relic
  of former, somewhat more prosperous times.</p>
  <p>In one of the chairs lolled the mysterious lodger, whom a strange Fate in
  a perverse mood seemed to have wafted to this isolated little cottage on
  the outskirts of the loneliest village in Thanet.</p>
  <p>Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans was puffing at that strange
  weed which of late had taken such marked hold of most men, tending to idleness
  in them, for it caused them to sit staring at the smoke which they drew from
  pipes made of clay; surely the Lord had never intended such strange doings,
  and Mistress Martha would willingly have protested against the unpleasant
  odor thus created by her lodger when he was puffing away, only that she stood
  somewhat in awe of his ill-humor and of his violent language, especially
  when Adam himself was from home.</p>
  <p>On these occasions&mdash;such, for instance, as the present one&mdash;she
  had, perforce, to be content with additional efforts at cleanliness, and,
  as she was convinced that so much smoke must be conducive to soot and dirt,
  she plied her dusting-cloth with redoubled vigor and energy. Whilst the prince
  lolled and pulled at his clay pipe, she busied herself all round the tiny
  room, polishing the backs of the old elm chairs, and the brass handles of
  the chest of drawers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How much longer are you going to fuss about, my good woman?&rdquo; quoth
  Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans impatiently after a while. &ldquo;This
  shuffling round me irritates my nerves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mistress Martha, however, suffered from deafness. She could see from the
  quick, angry turn of the head that her lodger was addressing her, but did
  not catch his words. She drew a little nearer, bending her ear to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh? ... what?&rdquo; she queried in that high-pitched voice peculiar
  to the deaf. &ldquo;I am somewhat hard of hearing just now. I did not hear
  thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But he pushed her roughly aside with a jerk of his elbow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; he said impatiently. &ldquo;Do not worry me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! the little pigs?&rdquo; she rejoined blithely. &ldquo;I thank
  thee ... they be doing nicely, thank the Lord ... six of them and ... eh?
  what? ... I&rsquo;m a bit hard of hearing these times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had some difficulty in keeping up even a semblance of calm. The placidity
  of the old Quakeress irritated him beyond endurance. He dreaded the return
  of Adam Lambert from his work, and worse still, he feared the arrival of
  Richard. Fortunately he had gathered from Martha that the young man had come
  home early in the day in a state of high nervous tension, bordering on acute
  fever. He had neither eaten nor drunk, but after tidying his clothes and
  reassuring her as to his future movements, he had sallied out into the woods
  and had not returned since then.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke had quickly arrived at the conclusion that Richard Lambert
  had seen and spoken to Lady Sue and had learned from her that she was now
  irrevocably married to him, whom she always called her prince. Doubtless,
  the young man was frenzied with grief, and in his weak state of health after
  the terrible happenings of the past few weeks, would mayhap, either go raving
  mad, or end his miserable existence over the cliffs. Either eventuality would
  suit Sir Marmaduke admirably, and he sighed with satisfaction at the thought
  that the knot between the heiress and himself was indeed tied sufficiently
  firm now to ensure her obedience to his will.</p>
  <p>There was to be one more scene in the brief and cruel drama which he had
  devised for the hoodwinking and final spoliation of a young and inexperienced
  girl. She had earlier in the day been placed in possession of all the negotiable
  part of her fortune. This, though by no means representing the whole of her
  wealth, which also lay in landed estates, was nevertheless of such magnitude
  that the thought of its possession caused every fiber in Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s
  body to thrill with the delight of expectancy.</p>
  <p>One more brief scene in the drama: the handing over of that vast fortune,
  by the young girl-wife&mdash;blindly and obediently&mdash;to the man whom
  she believed to be her husband. Once that scene enacted, the curtain would
  fall on the love episode &rsquo;twixt a romantic and ignorant maid and the
  most daring scoundrel that had ever committed crime to obtain a fortune.</p>
  <p>In anticipation of that last and magnificent <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>, Sir
  Marmaduke had once more donned the disguise of the exiled Orl&eacute;ans
  prince: the elaborate clothes, the thick perruque, the black silk shade over
  the left eye, which gave him such a sinister expression.</p>
  <p>Now he was literally devoured with the burning desire to see Sue arriving
  with that wallet in her hand, which contained securities and grants to the
  value of &pound;500,000. A brief interlude with her, a few words of perfunctory
  affection, a few assurances of good faith, and he&mdash;as her princely husband&mdash;would
  vanish from her ken forever.</p>
  <p>He meant to go abroad immediately&mdash;this very night, if possible. Prudence
  and caution could easily be thrown to the winds, once the negotiable securities
  were actually in his hands. What he could convert into money, he would do
  immediately, going to Amsterdam first, to withdraw the sum standing at the
  bank there on deposit, and for which anon, he would possess the receipt;
  after that the sale of the grant of monopolies should be easy of accomplishment.
  Sir Marmaduke had boundless faith in his own ability to carry through his
  own business. He might stand to lose some of the money perhaps; prudence
  and caution might necessitate the relinquishing of certain advantages, but
  even then he would be rich and passing rich, and he knew that he ran but
  little risk of detection. The girl was young, inexperienced and singularly
  friendless: Sir Marmaduke felt convinced that none of the foreign transactions
  could ever be directly traced to himself.</p>
  <p>He would be prudent and Europe was wide, and he meant to leave English grants
  and securities severely alone.</p>
  <p>He had mused and pondered on his plans all day. The evening found him half-exhausted
  with nerve-strain, febrile and almost sick with the agony of waiting.</p>
  <p>He had calculated that Sue would be free towards seven o&rsquo;clock, as
  he had given Editha strict injunctions to keep discreetly out of the way,
  whilst at a previous meeting in the park, it had been arranged that the young
  girl should come to the cottage with the money, on the evening of her twenty-first
  birthday and there hand her fortune over to her rightful lord.</p>
  <p>Now Sir Marmaduke cursed himself and his folly for having made this arrangement.
  He had not known&mdash;when he made it&mdash;that Richard would be back at
  Acol then. Adam the smith, never came home before eight o&rsquo;clock and
  the old Quakeress herself would not have been much in the way.</p>
  <p>Even now she had shuffled back into her kitchen, leaving her ill-humored
  lodger to puff away at the malodorous weed as he chose. But Richard might
  return at any moment, and then ...</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke had never thought of that possible contingency. If Richard
  Lambert came face to face with him, he would of a surety pierce the disguise
  of the prince, and recognize the man who had so deeply wronged poor, unsuspecting
  Lady Sue. If only a kindly Fate had kept the young man away another twenty-four
  hours! or better still, if it led the despairing lover&rsquo;s footsteps
  to the extremest edge of the cliffs!</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke now paced the narrow room up and down in an agony of impatience.
  Nine o&rsquo;clock had struck long ago, but Sue had not yet come. The wildest
  imaginings run riot in the schemer&rsquo;s brain: every hour, nay! every
  minute spent within was fraught with danger. He sought his broad-brimmed
  hat, determined now to meet Sue in the park, to sally forth at risk of missing
  her, at risk of her arriving here at the cottage when he was absent, and
  of her meeting Richard Lambert perhaps, before the irrevocable deed of gift
  had been accomplished.</p>
  <p>But the suspense was intolerable.</p>
  <p>With a violent oath Sir Marmaduke pressed the hat over his head, and strode
  to the door.</p>
  <p>His hand was on the latch, when he heard a faint sound from without: a girl&rsquo;s
  footsteps, timorous yet swift, along the narrow flagged path which led down
  the tiny garden gate.</p>
  <p>The next moment he had thrown open the door and Sue stood before him.</p>
  <p>Anyone but a bold and unscrupulous schemer would have been struck by the
  pathos of the solitary figure which now appeared in the tiny doorway. The
  penetrating November drizzle had soaked through the dark cloak and hood which
  now hung heavy and dank round the young girl&rsquo;s shoulders. Framed by
  the hood, her face appeared preternaturally pale, her lips were quivering
  and her eyes, large and dilated, had almost a hunted look in them.</p>
  <p>Oh! the pity and sadness of it all! For in her small and trembling hands
  she was clutching with pathetic tenacity a small, brown wallet which contained
  a fortune worthy of a princess.</p>
  <p>She looked eagerly into her husband&rsquo;s face, dreading the scowl, the
  outburst of anger or jealousy mayhap with which of late, alas! he had so
  oft greeted her arrival. But as was his wont, he stood with his back to the
  lighted room, and she could not read the expression of that one cyclops-like
  eye, which to-night appeared more sinister than ever beneath the thick perruque
  and broad-brimmed hat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry to be so late,&rdquo; she said timidly, &ldquo;the evening
  repast at the Court was interminable and Mistress de Chavasse full of gossip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;am I not used to seeing
  that your social duties oft make you forget your husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are unjust, Am&eacute;d&eacute;,&rdquo; she rejoined.</p>
  <p>She entered the little parlor and stood beside the table, making no movement
  to divest herself of her dripping cloak, or to sit down, nor indeed did her
  husband show the slightest inclination to ask her to do either. He had closed
  the door behind her, and followed her to the center of the room. Was it by
  accident or design that as he reached the table he threw his broad-brimmed
  hat, down with such an unnecessary flourish of the arm that he knocked over
  one of the heavy pewter candlesticks, so that it rolled down upon the floor,
  causing the tallow candle to sputter and die out with a weird and hissing
  sound?</p>
  <p>Only one dim yellow light now illumined the room, it shone full into the
  pallid face of the young wife standing some three paces from the table, whilst
  Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans&rsquo; face between her
  and the light, was once more in deep shadow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are unjust,&rdquo; she repeated firmly. &ldquo;Have I not run
  the gravest possible risks for your sake, and those without murmur or complaint,
  for the past six months? Did I not compromise my reputation for you by meeting
  you alone ... of nights? ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was laboring under the idea, my wench, that you were doing all
  that because you cared for me,&rdquo; he retorted with almost brutal curtness, &ldquo;and
  because you had the desire to become the Princess d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans;
  that desire is now gratified and ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had not really meant to be unkind. There was of a truth no object to
  be gained by being brutal to her now. But that wallet, which she held so
  tightly clutched, acted as an irritant to his nerves. Never of very equable
  temperament and holding all women in lofty scorn, he chafed against all parleyings
  with his wife, now that the goal of his ambition was so close at hand.</p>
  <p>She winced at the insult, and the tears which she fain would have hidden
  from him, rose involuntarily to her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;if you only knew how little I care
  for that title of princess! ... Did you perchance think that I cared? ...
  Nay! how gladly would I give up all thought of ever bearing that proud appellation,
  in exchange for a few more happy illusions such as I possessed three months
  ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Illusions are all very well for a school-girl, my dear Suzanne,&rdquo; he
  remarked with a cool shrug of his massive shoulders. &ldquo;Reality should
  be more attractive to you now....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked her up and down, realizing perhaps for the first time that she
  was exquisitely beautiful; beautiful always, but more so now in the pathos
  of her helplessness. Somewhat perfunctorily, because in his ignorance of
  women he thought that it would please her, and also because vaguely something
  human and elemental had suddenly roused his pulses, he relinquished his nonchalant
  attitude, and came a step nearer to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are very beautiful, my Suzanne,&rdquo; he said half-ironically,
  and with marked emphasis on the possessive.</p>
  <p>Again he drew nearer, not choosing to note the instinctive stiffening of
  her figure, the shrinking look in her eyes. He caught her arm and drew her
  to him, laughing a low mocking laugh as he did so, for she had turned her
  face away from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said lightly, &ldquo;will you not kiss me, my beautiful
  Suzanne? ... my wife, my princess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was silent, impassive, indifferent so he thought, although the arm which
  he held trembled within his grip.</p>
  <p>He stretched out his other hand, and taking her chin between his fingers,
  he forcibly turned her face towards him. Something in her face, in her attitude,
  now roused a certain rough passion in him. Mayhap the weary wailing during
  the day, the agonizing impatience, or the golden argosy so near to port,
  had strung up his nerves to fever pitch.</p>
  <p>Irritation against her impassiveness, in such glaring contrast to her glowing
  ardor of but a few weeks ago, mingled with that essentially male desire to
  subdue and to conquer that which is inclined to resist, sent the blood coursing
  wildly through his veins.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said with a sigh half of desire, half of satisfaction,
  as he looked into her upturned face, &ldquo;the chaste blush of the bride
  is vastly becoming to you, my Suzanne! ... it acts as fuel to the flames
  of my love ... since I can well remember the passionate kisses you gave me
  so willingly awhile ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The thought of that happy past, gave her sudden strength. Catching him unawares
  she wrenched herself free from his hold.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is a mockery, prince,&rdquo; she said with vehemence, and meeting
  his half-mocking glance with one of scorn. &ldquo;Do you think that I have
  been blind these last few weeks? ... Your love for me hath changed, if indeed
  it ever existed, whilst I ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whilst you, my beautiful Suzanne,&rdquo; he rejoined lightly, &ldquo;are
  mine ... irrevocably, irretrievably mine ... mine because I love you, and
  because you are my wife ... and owe me that obedience which you vowed to
  Heaven that you would give me.... That is so, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence in the tiny cottage parlor now, whilst
  he&mdash;gauging the full value of his words, knowing by instinct that he
  had struck the right cord in that vibrating girlish heart, watched the subtle
  change in her face from defiance and wrath to submission and appeal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Am&eacute;d&eacute;,&rdquo; she murmured after a while, &ldquo;I
  owe you obedience, honor and love, and you need not fear that I will fail
  in either. But you,&rdquo; she added with pathetic anxiety, &ldquo;you do
  care for me still? do you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I care for you,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I worship you....
  There! ... will that satisfy you? ... And now?&rdquo; he added peremptorily, &ldquo;have
  you brought the money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The short interlude of passion was over. His eye had accidentally rested
  for one second on the leather wallet, which she still held tightly clutched,
  and all thoughts of her beauty, of his power or his desires, had flown out
  to the winds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied meekly, &ldquo;it is all here, in the wallet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She laid it down upon the table, feeling neither anxiety nor remorse. He
  was her husband and had a right to her fortune, as he had to her person and
  to her thoughts and heart an he wished. Nor did she care about the money,
  as to the value of which she was, of course, ignorant.</p>
  <p>Her wealth, up to now, had only had a meaning for her, as part of some noble
  scheme for the regeneration of mankind. Now she hoped vaguely, as she put
  that wallet down on the table, then pushed it towards her husband, that she
  was purchasing her freedom with her wealth.</p>
  <p>Certainly she realized that his thoughts had very quickly been diverted
  from her beauty to the contents of the wallet. The mocking laugh died down
  on his lips, giving place to a sigh of deep satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were very prudent, my dear Suzanne, to place this portion of
  your wealth in my charge,&rdquo; he said as he slipped the bulky papers into
  the lining of his doublet. &ldquo;Of course it is all yours, and I&mdash;your
  husband&mdash;am but the repository and guardian of your fortune. And now
  methinks &rsquo;twere prudent for you to return to the Court. Sir Marmaduke
  de Chavasse will be missing you....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It did not seem to strike her as strange that he should dismiss her thus
  abruptly, and make no attempt to explain what his future plans might be,
  nor indeed what his intentions were with regard to herself.</p>
  <p>The intensity of her disappointment, the utter loneliness and helplessness
  of her position had caused a veritable numbing of her faculties and of her
  spirit and for the moment she was perhaps primarily conscious of a sense
  of relief at her dismissal.</p>
  <p>Like her wedding in the dismal little church, this day of her birthday,
  of her independence, of her handing over her fortune to her husband for the
  glorious purposes of his selfless schemes had been so very, very different
  to what she had pictured to herself in her girlish and romantic dreams.</p>
  <p>The sordidness of it all had ruthlessly struck her; for the first time in
  her intercourse with this man, she doubted the genuineness of his motives.
  With the passing of her fortune from her hands to his, the last vestige of
  belief in him died down with appalling suddenness.</p>
  <p>It could not have been because of the expression in his eyes, as he fingered
  the wallet, for this she could not see, since his face was still in shadow.
  It must have been just instinct&mdash;that, and the mockery of his attempt
  to make love to her. Had he ever loved her, he could not have mocked ...
  not now, that she was helpless and entirely at his mercy.</p>
  <p>Love once felt, is sacred to him who feels: mockery even of the ashes of
  love is an impossible desecration, one beyond the power of any man. Then,
  if he had never loved her, why had he pretended? Why have deceived her with
  a semblance of passion?</p>
  <p>And the icy whisper of reason blew into her mental ear, the ugly word: &ldquo;Money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He opened the door for her, and without another word, she passed out into
  the dark night. Only when she reached the tiny gate at the end of the flagged
  path, did she realize that he was walking with her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can find my way alone through the woods,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;I
  came alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was earlier then,&rdquo; he rejoined blandly, &ldquo;and I prefer
  to see you safely as far as the park.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And they walked on side by side in silence. Overhead the melancholy drip
  of moisture falling from leaf to leaf, and from leaf to the ground, was the
  only sound that accompanied their footsteps. Sue shivered beneath her damp
  cloak; but she walked as far away from him as the width of the woodland path
  allowed. He seemed absorbed in his own thoughts and not to notice how she
  shrank from the slightest contact with him.</p>
  <p>At the park gate he paused, having opened it for her to pass through.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must bid you good-night here, Suzanne,&rdquo; he said lightly, &ldquo;there
  may be footpads about and I must place your securities away under lock and
  key. I may be absent a few days for that purpose.... London, you know,&rdquo; he
  added vaguely.</p>
  <p>Then as she made no comment:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will arrange for our next meeting,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;anon,
  there will be no necessity to keep our marriage a secret, but until I give
  you permission to speak of it, &rsquo;twere better that you remained silent
  on that score.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She contrived to murmur:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And presently, as he made no movement towards her, she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This time he had not even desired to kiss her.</p>
  <p>The next moment she had disappeared in the gloom. She fled as fast as she
  dared in the inky blackness of this November night. She could have run for
  miles, or for hours, away! away from all this sordidness, this avarice, this
  deceit and cruelty! Away! away from him!!</p>
  <p>How glad she was that darkness enveloped her, for now she felt horribly
  ashamed. Instinct, too, is cruel at times! Instinct had been silent so long
  during the most critical juncture of her own folly. Now it spoke loudly,
  warningly; now that it was too late.</p>
  <p>Ashamed of her own stupidity and blindness! her vanity mayhap had alone
  led her to believe the passionate protestations of a liar.</p>
  <p>A liar! a mean, cowardly schemer, but her husband for all that! She owed
  him love, honor and obedience; if he commanded, she must obey; if he called
  she must fain go to him.</p>
  <p>Oh! please God! that she had succeeded in purchasing her freedom from him
  by placing &pound;500,000 in his hands.</p>
  <p>Shame! shame that this should be! that she should have mistaken vile schemes
  for love, that a liar&rsquo;s kisses should have polluted her soul! that
  she should be the wife, the bondswoman of a cheat!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter29"></a>Chapter 29<br>
  Good-Bye</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Sue!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cry rang out in the night close to her, and arrested her fleeing footsteps.
  She was close to the ha-ha, having run on blindly, madly, guided by that
  unaccountable instinct which makes for the shelter of home.</p>
  <p>In a moment she had recognized the voice. In a moment she was beside her
  friend. Her passionate mood passed away, leaving her calm and almost at peace.
  Shame still caused her cheeks to burn, but the night was dark and doubtless
  he would not see.</p>
  <p>But she could feel that he was near her, therefore, there was no fear in
  her. What had guided her footsteps hither she did not know. Of course he
  had guessed that she had been to meet her husband.</p>
  <p>There were no exclamations or protestations between them. She merely said
  quite simply:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am glad that you came to say &lsquo;good-bye!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>The park was open here. The nearest trees were some fifty paces away, and
  in the ghostly darkness they could just perceive one another&rsquo;s silhouettes.
  The mist enveloped them as with a shroud, the damp cold air caused them to
  shiver as under the embrace of death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is good-bye,&rdquo; he rejoined calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayhap that I shall go abroad soon,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With that man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cry broke out from the bitterness of his heart, but a cold little hand
  was placed restrainingly on his.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I go ... if I go,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I shall do so
  with my husband.... You see, my friend, do you not, that there is naught
  else to say but &lsquo;good-bye&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you will be happy, Sue?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope so!&rdquo; she sighed wistfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will always remember, will you not, my dear lady, that wherever
  you may be, there is always someone in remote Thanet, who is ready at any
  time to give his life for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! I will remember,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you must promise me,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;promise me now,
  Sue, that if ... which Heaven forbid ... you are in any trouble or sorrow,
  and I can do aught for you, that you will let me know and send for me ...
  and I will come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Richard, I promise.... Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And she was gone. The mist, the gloom hid her completely from view. He waited
  by the little bridge, for the night was still and he would have heard if
  she called.</p>
  <p>He heard her light footsteps on the gravel, then on the flagged walk. Anon
  came the sound of the opening and shutting of a door. After that, silence:
  the silence of a winter&rsquo;s night, when not a breath of wind stirs the
  dead branches of the trees, when woodland and field and park are wrapped
  in the shroud of the mist.</p>
  <p>Richard Lambert turned back towards the village.</p>
  <p>Sue&mdash;married to another man&mdash;had passed out of his life forever.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter30"></a>Chapter 30<br>
  All Because Of The Tinder-Box</b></h2>
  <p>How oft it is in life that Fate, leading a traveler in easy gradients upwards
  along a road of triumph, suddenly assumes a madcap mood and with wanton hand
  throws a tiny obstacle in his way; an obstacle at times infinitesimal, scarce
  visible on that way towards success, yet powerful enough to trip the unwary
  traveler and bring him down to earth with sudden and woeful vigor.</p>
  <p>With Sir Marmaduke so far everything had prospered according to his wish.
  He had inveigled the heiress into a marriage which bound her to his will,
  yet left him personally free; she had placed her fortune unreservedly and
  unconditionally in his hands, and had, so far as he knew, not even suspected
  the treachery practiced upon her by her guardian.</p>
  <p>Not a soul had pierced his disguise, and the identity of Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans
  was unknown even to his girl-wife.</p>
  <p>With the disappearance of that mysterious personage, Sir Marmaduke having
  realized Lady Sue&rsquo;s fortune, could resume life as an independent gentleman,
  with this difference, that henceforth he would be passing rich, able to gratify
  his ambition, to cut a figure in the world as he chose.</p>
  <p>Fortune which had been his idol all his life, now was indeed his slave.
  He had it, he possessed it. It lay snug and safe in a leather wallet inside
  the lining of his doublet.</p>
  <p>Sue had gone out of his sight, desirous apparently of turning her back on
  him forever. He was free and rich. The game had been risky, daring beyond
  belief, yet he had won in the end. He could afford to laugh now at all the
  dangers, the subterfuges, the machinations which had all gone to the making
  of that tragic comedy in which he had been the principal actor.</p>
  <p>The last scene in the drama had been successfully enacted. The curtain had
  been finally lowered; and Sir Marmaduke swore that there should be no epilogue
  to the play.</p>
  <p>Then it was that Fate&mdash;so well-named the wanton jade&mdash;shook herself
  from out the torpor in which she had wandered for so long beside this Kentish
  squire. A spirit of mischief seized upon her and whispered that she had held
  this man quite long enough by the hand and that it would be far more amusing
  now to see him measure his length on the ground.</p>
  <p>And all that Fate did, in order to satisfy this spirit of mischief, was
  to cause Sir Marmaduke to forget his tinder-box in the front parlor of Mistress
  Martha Lambert&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
  <p>A tinder-box is a small matter! an object of infinitesimal importance when
  the broad light of day illumines the interior of houses or the bosquets of
  a park, but it becomes an object of paramount importance, when the night
  is pitch dark, and when it is necessary to effect an exchange of clothing
  within the four walls of a pavilion.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke had walked to the park gates with his wife, not so much because
  he was anxious for her safety, but chiefly because he meant to retire within
  the pavilion, there to cast aside forever the costume and appurtenances of
  Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans and to reassume the sable-colored
  doublet and breeches of the Roundhead squire, which proceeding he had for
  the past six months invariably accomplished in the lonely little building
  on the outskirts of his own park.</p>
  <p>As soon, therefore, as he realized that Sue had gone, he turned his steps
  towards the pavilion. The night seemed additionally dark here under the elms,
  and Sir Marmaduke searched in his pocket for his tinder-box.</p>
  <p>It was not there. He had left it at the cottage, and quickly recollected
  seeing it lying on the table at the very moment that Sue pushed the leather
  wallet towards him.</p>
  <p>He had mounted the few stone steps which led up to the building, but even
  whilst he groped for the latch with an impatient hand, he realized how impossible
  it would be for him anon, to change his clothes, in the dark; not only to
  undress and dress again, but to collect the belongings of the Prince d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans
  subsequently, for the purpose of destroying them at an early opportunity.</p>
  <p>Groping about in inky blackness might mean the forgetting of some article
  of apparel, which, if found later on, might lead to suspicion or even detection
  of the fraud. Sir Marmaduke dared not risk it.</p>
  <p>Light he needed, and light he ought to have. The tinder-box had become of
  paramount importance, and it was sheer wantonness on the part of Fate that
  she should have allowed that little article to rest forgotten on the table
  in Mistress Lambert&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke remained pondering&mdash;in the darkness and the mist&mdash;for
  a while. His own doublet and breeches, shoes and stockings were in the pavilion:
  would he ever be able to get at them without a light? No, certainly not!
  nor could he venture to go home to the Court in his present disguise, and
  leave his usual clothes in this remote building.</p>
  <p>Prying, suspicious eyes&mdash;such as those of Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy,
  for instance, might prove exceedingly uncomfortable and even dangerous.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, would it not be ten thousand times more dangerous to
  go back to the cottage now and risk meeting Richard Lambert face to face?</p>
  <p>And it was Richard whom Sir Marmaduke feared.</p>
  <p>He had, therefore, almost decided to try his luck at dressing in the dark,
  and was once more fumbling with the latch of the pavilion door, when through
  the absolute silence of the air, there came to his ear through the mist the
  sound of a young voice calling the name of &ldquo;Sue!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The voice was that of Richard Lambert.</p>
  <p>The coast would be clear then. Richard had met Sue in the park: no doubt
  he would hold her a few moments in conversation. The schemer cared not what
  the two young people would or would not say to one another; all that interested
  him now was the fact that Richard was not at the cottage, and that, therefore,
  it would be safe to run back and fetch the tinder-box.</p>
  <p>All this was a part of Fate&rsquo;s mischievous prank. Sir Marmaduke was
  not afraid of meeting the old Quakeress, nor yet the surly smith; Richard
  being out of the way, he had no misgivings in his mind when he retraced his
  steps towards the cottage.</p>
  <p>It was close on eight o&rsquo;clock then, in fact the tiny bell in Acol
  church struck the hour even as Sir Marmaduke lifted the latch of the little
  garden gate.</p>
  <p>The old woman was in the parlor, busy as usual with her dusting-cloth. Without
  heeding her, Sir Marmaduke strode up to the table and pushing the crockery,
  which now littered it, aside, he searched for his tinder-box.</p>
  <p>It was not there. With an impatient oath, he turned to Mistress Martha,
  and roughly demanded if she had seen it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh? ... What?&rdquo; she queried, shuffling a little nearer to him, &ldquo;I
  am somewhat hard of hearing ... as thou knowest....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you seen my tinder-box?&rdquo; he repeated with ever-growing
  irritation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yea, the fog!&rdquo; she said blandly, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis damp
  too, of a truth, and ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold your confounded tongue!&rdquo; he shouted wrathfully, &ldquo;and
  try and hear me. My tinder-box....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thy what? I am a bit ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse you for an old fool,&rdquo; swore Sir Marmaduke, who by now
  was in a towering passion.</p>
  <p>With a violent gesture he pushed the old woman aside and turning on her
  in an uncontrolled access of fury, with both arms upraised, he shouted:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t hear me now, I&rsquo;ll break every bone in your
  ugly body.... Where is my ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It had all happened in a very few seconds: his entrance, his search for
  the missing box, the growing irritation in him which had caused him to lose
  control of his temper. And now, even before the threatening words were well
  out of his mouth, he suddenly felt a vigorous onslaught from the rear, and
  his own throat clutched by strong and sinewy fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll break every bone in thy accursed body!&rdquo; shouted
  a hoarse voice close to his ear, &ldquo;if thou darest so much as lay a finger
  on the old woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The struggle was violent and brief. Sir Marmaduke already felt himself overmastered.
  Adam Lambert had taken him unawares. He was rough and very powerful. Sir
  Marmaduke was no weakling, yet encumbered by his fantastic clothes he was
  no match for the smith. Adam turned him about in his nervy hands like a puppet.</p>
  <p>Now he was in front and above him, glaring down at the man he hated with
  eyes which would have searched the very depths of his enemy&rsquo;s soul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou damned foreigner!&rdquo; he growled between clenched teeth, &ldquo;thou
  vermin! ... Thou toad! Thou ... on thy knees! ... on thy knees, I say ...
  beg her pardon for thy foul language ... now at once ... dost hear? ... ere
  I squeeze the breath out of thee....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke felt his knees giving way under him, the smith&rsquo;s grasp
  on his throat had in no way relaxed. Mistress Martha vainly tried to interpose.
  She was all for peace, and knew that the Lord liked not a fiery temper. But
  the look in Adam&rsquo;s face frightened her, and she had always been in
  terror of the foreigner. Without thought, and imagining that &rsquo;twas
  her presence which irritated the lodger, she beat a hasty retreat to her
  room upstairs, even as Adam Lambert finally succeeded in forcing Sir Marmaduke
  down on his knees, not ceasing to repeat the while:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her pardon ... beg her pardon, my fine prince ... lick the dust in
  an English cottage, thou foreign devil ... or, by God, I will kill thee!
  ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; gasped Sir Marmaduke, whom the icy fear of imminent
  discovery gripped more effectually even than did the village blacksmith&rsquo;s
  muscular fingers, &ldquo;let me go ... damn you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not before I have made thee lick the dust,&rdquo; said Adam grimly,
  bringing one huge palm down on the elaborate perruque, and forcing Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s
  head down, down towards the ground, &ldquo;lick it ... lick it ... Prince
  of Orl&eacute;ans....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He burst out laughing in the midst of his fury, at sight of this disdainful
  gentleman, with the proud title, about to come in violent contact with a
  cottage floor. But Sir Marmaduke struggled violently still. He had been wiser
  no doubt, to take the humiliation quietly, to lick the dust and to pacify
  the smith: but what man is there who would submit to brute force without
  using his own to protect himself?</p>
  <p>Then Fate at last worked her wanton will.</p>
  <p>In the struggle the fantastic perruque and heavy mustache of Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans
  remained in the smith&rsquo;s hand whilst it was the round head and clean-shaven
  face of Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse which came in contact with the floor.</p>
  <p>In an instant, stricken at first dumb with surprise and horror, but quickly
  recovering the power of speech, Adam Lambert murmured:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You? ... You? ... Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse! ... Oh! my God! ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His grip on his enemy had, of course, relaxed. Sir Marmaduke was able to
  struggle to his feet. Fate had dealt him a blow as unexpected as it was violent.
  But he had not been the daring schemer that he was, if throughout the past
  six months, the possibility of such a moment as this had not lurked at the
  back of his mind.</p>
  <p>The blow, therefore, did not find him quite unprepared. It had been stunning
  but not absolutely crushing. Even whilst Adam Lambert was staring with almost
  senseless amazement alternately at him and at the bundle of false hair which
  he was still clutching, Sir Marmaduke had struggled to his feet.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter31"></a>Chapter 31<br>
  The Assignation</b></h2>
  <p>He had recovered his outward composure at any rate, and the next moment
  was busy re-adjusting his doublet and bands before the mirror over the hearth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! my violent friend!&rdquo; he said coolly, speaking over his
  shoulder, &ldquo;of a truth it is mine own self! Your landlord you see, to
  whom that worthy woman upstairs owes this nice cottage which she has had
  rent free for over ten years ... not the foreign vermin, you see,&rdquo; he
  added with a pleasant laugh, &ldquo;which maketh your actions of just now,
  somewhat unpleasant to explain. Is that not so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! but by the Lord!&rdquo; quoth Adam Lambert, still somewhat dazed,
  vaguely frightened himself now at the magnitude, the importance of what he
  had done, &ldquo;meseems that &rsquo;tis thine actions, friend, which will
  be unpleasant to explain. Thou didst not put on these play-actor&rsquo;s
  robes for a good purpose, I&rsquo;ll warrant! ... I cannot guess what is
  thy game, but methinks her young ladyship would wish to know something of
  its rules ... or mayhap, my brother Richard who is no friend of thine, forsooth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gradually his voice had become steadier, his manner more assured. A glimmer
  of light on the Squire&rsquo;s strange doings had begun to penetrate his
  simple, dull brain. Vaguely he guessed the purport of the disguise and of
  the lies, and the mention of Lady Sue&rsquo;s name was not an arrow shot
  thoughtlessly into the air. At the same time he had not perceived the slightest
  quiver of fear or even of anxiety on Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>The latter had in the meanwhile put his crumpled toilet in order and now
  turned with an urbane smile to his glowering antagonist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will not deny, kind master,&rdquo; he said pleasantly, &ldquo;that
  you might cause me a vast amount of unpleasantness just now ... although
  of a truth, I do not perceive that you would benefit yourself overmuch thereby.
  On the contrary, you would vastly lose. Your worthy aunt, Mistress Lambert,
  would lose a pleasant home, and you would never know what you and your brother
  Richard have vainly striven to find out these past ten years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What may that be, pray?&rdquo; queried the smith sullenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who you both are,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Marmaduke blandly, as he calmly
  sat down in one of the stiff-backed elm chairs beside the hearth, &ldquo;and
  why worthy Mistress Lambert never speaks to you of your parentage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who we both are?&rdquo; retorted Lambert with obvious bitterness, &ldquo;two
  poor castaways, who, but for the old woman would have been left to starve,
  and who have tried, therefore, to be a bit grateful to her, and to earn an
  honest livelihood. That is what we are, Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse; and now
  prithee tell me, who the devil art thou?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are overfond of swearing, worthy master,&rdquo; quoth Sir Marmaduke
  lightly, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis sinful so I&rsquo;m told, for one of your creed.
  But that is no matter to me. You are, believe me, somewhat more interesting
  than you imagine. Though I doubt if to a Quaker, being heir to title and
  vast estates hath more than a fleeting interest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the smith had shrugged his broad shoulders and uttered an exclamation
  of contempt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Title and vast estates?&rdquo; he said with an ironical laugh. &ldquo;Nay!
  Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, the bait is passing clumsy. An you wish me to
  hold my tongue about you and your affairs, you&rsquo;ll have to be vastly
  sharper than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mistake me, friend smith, I am not endeavoring to purchase your
  silence. I hold certain information relating to your parentage. This I would
  be willing to impart to a friend, yet loath to do so to an enemy. A man doth
  not like to see his enemy in possession of fifteen thousand pounds a year.
  Does he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Sir Marmaduke appeared absorbed in the contemplation of his left shoe,
  whilst Adam Lambert repeated stupidly and vaguely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifteen thousand pounds a year? I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even you, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was said so simply, and with such conviction-carrying certainty&mdash;that
  in spite of himself Lambert&rsquo;s sulkiness vanished. He drew nearer to
  Sir Marmaduke, looked down on him silently for a second or two, then muttered
  through his teeth:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have the proofs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They will be at your service, my choleric friend,&rdquo; replied
  the other suavely, &ldquo;in exchange for your silence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Adam Lambert drew a chair close to his whilom enemy, sat down opposite to
  him, with elbows resting on his knee, his clenched fists supporting his chin,
  and his eyes&mdash;anxious, eager, glowing, fixed resolutely on de Chavasse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold my tongue, never fear,&rdquo; he said curtly. &ldquo;Show
  me the proofs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke gave a pleasant little laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not so fast, my friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do not carry such
  important papers about in my breeches&rsquo; pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And he rose from his chair, picked up the perruque and false mustache which
  the other man had dropped upon the floor, and adjusting these on his head
  and face he once more presented the appearance of the exiled Orl&eacute;ans
  prince.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But thou&rsquo;lt show them to me to-night,&rdquo; insisted the smith
  roughly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can I, mine impatient friend?&rdquo; quoth de Chavasse lightly, &ldquo;the
  hour is late already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! what matter the lateness of the hour? I am oft abroad at night,
  early and late, and thou, methinks, hast oft had the midnight hour for company.
  When and where wilt meet me?&rdquo; added Lambert peremptorily, &ldquo;I
  must see those proofs to-night, before many hours are over, lest the blood
  in my veins burn my body to ashes with impatience. When wilt meet me? Eleven?
  ... Midnight? ... or the small hours of the morn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He spoke quickly, jerking out his words through closed teeth, his eyes burning
  with inward fever, his fists closing and unclosing with rapid febrile movements
  of the fingers.</p>
  <p>The pent-up disappointment and rebellion of a whole lifetime against Fate,
  was expressed in the man&rsquo;s attitude, the agonizing eagerness which
  indeed seemed to be consuming him.</p>
  <p>De Chavasse, on the other hand, had become singularly calm. The black shade
  as usual hid one of his eyes, masking and distorting the expression of his
  face; the false mustache, too, concealed the movements of his lips, and the
  more his opponent&rsquo;s eyes tried to search the schemer&rsquo;s face,
  the more inscrutable and bland did the latter become.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, my friend,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I do not know that
  the thought of a midnight excursion with you appeals to my sense of personal
  security. I ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But with a violent oath, Adam had jumped to his feet, and kicked the chair
  away from under him so that it fell backwards with a loud clatter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;lt meet me to-night,&rdquo; he said loudly and threateningly
  now, &ldquo;thou&rsquo;lt meet me on the path near the cliffs of Epple Bay
  half an hour before midnight, and if thou hast lied to me, I&rsquo;ll throw
  thee over and Thanet then will be rid of thee ... but if thou dost not come,
  I&rsquo;ll to my brother Richard even before the church clock of Acol hath
  sounded the hour of midnight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>De Chavasse watched him silently for the space of three seconds, realizing,
  of course, that he was completely in that man&rsquo;s power, and also that
  the smith meant every word that he said. The discovery of the monstrous fraud
  by Richard Lambert within the next few hours was a contingency which he could
  not even contemplate without shuddering. He certainly would much prefer to
  give up to this uncouth laborer the proofs of his parentage which eventually
  might mean an earldom and a fortune to a village blacksmith.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke had reflected on all this, of course, before broaching the
  subject to Adam Lambert at all. Now he was prepared to go through with the
  scheme to the end if need be. His uncle, the Earl of Northallerton, might
  live another twenty years, whilst he himself&mdash;if pursued for fraud,
  might have to spend those years in jail.</p>
  <p>On the whole it was simpler to purchase the smith&rsquo;s silence ... this
  way or another. Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s reflections at this moment would have
  delighted those evil spirits who are supposed to revel in the misdoings of
  mankind.</p>
  <p>The thought of the lonely path near the cliffs of Epple Bay tickled his
  fancy in a manner for which perhaps at this moment he himself could not have
  accounted. He certainly did not fear Adam Lambert and now said decisively:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, my friend, an you wish it, I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Half an hour before midnight,&rdquo; insisted Lambert, &ldquo;on
  the cliffs at Epple Bay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Half an hour before midnight: on the cliffs of Epple Bay,&rdquo; assented
  the other.</p>
  <p>He picked up his hat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where art going?&rdquo; queried the smith suspiciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To change my clothing,&rdquo; replied Sir Marmaduke, who was fingering
  that fateful tinder-box which alone had brought about the present crisis, &ldquo;and
  to fetch those proofs which you are so anxious to see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;lt not fail me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely not,&rdquo; quoth de Chavasse, as he finally went out of the
  room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter32"></a>Chapter 32<br>
  The Path Near The Cliffs</b></h2>
  <p>The mist had not lifted. Over the sea it hung heavy and dank like a huge
  sheet of gray thrown over things secret and unavowable. It was thickest down
  in the bay lurking in the crevices of the chalk, in the great caverns and
  mighty architecture carved by the patient toil of the billows in the solid
  mass of the cliffs.</p>
  <p>Up above it was slightly less dense: allowing distinct peeps of the rough
  carpet of coarse grass, of the downtrodden path winding towards Acol, of
  the edge of the cliff, abrupt, precipitous, with a drop of some ninety feet
  into that gray pall of mist to the sands below.</p>
  <p>And higher up still, above the mist itself, a deep blue sky dotted with
  stars, and a full moon, pale and circled with luminous vapors. A gentle breeze
  had risen about half an hour ago and was blowing the mist hither and thither,
  striving to disperse it, but not yet succeeding in mastering it, for it only
  shifted restlessly to and fro, like the giant garments of titanic ghosts,
  revealing now a distant peep of sea, anon the interior of a colonnaded cavern,
  abode of mysterious ghouls, or again a nest of gulls in a deep crevice of
  the chalk: revealing and hiding again:&mdash;a shroud dragged listlessly
  over monstrous dead things.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse had some difficulty in keeping to the footpath
  which leads from the woods of Acol straight toward the cliffs. Unlike Adam
  Lambert, his eyes were unaccustomed to pierce the moist pall which hid the
  distance from his view.</p>
  <p>Strangely enough he had not cast aside the fantastic accouterments of the
  French prince, and though these must have been as singularly uncomfortable,
  as they were inappropriate, for a midnight walk, nevertheless, he still wore
  the heavy perruque, the dark mustache, broad-brimmed hat, and black shade
  which were so characteristic of the mysterious personage.</p>
  <p>He had heard the church clock at Acol village strike half an hour after
  eleven and knew that the smith would already be waiting for him.</p>
  <p>The acrid smell of seaweed struck forcibly now upon his nostrils. The grass
  beneath his feet had become more sparse and more coarse. The moisture which
  clung to his face had a taste of salt in it. Obviously he was quite close
  to the edge of the cliffs.</p>
  <p>The next moment and without any warning a black outline appeared in the
  moon-illumined density. It was Adam Lambert pacing up and down with the impatience
  of an imprisoned beast of prey.</p>
  <p>A second or two later the febrile hand of the smith had gripped Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s
  shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have brought those proofs?&rdquo; he queried hoarsely.</p>
  <p>His face was wet with the mist, and he had apparently oft wiped it with
  his hand or sleeve, for great streaks of dirt marked his cheeks and forehead,
  giving him a curious satanic expression, whilst his short lank hair obviously
  roughed up by impatient fingers, bristled above his square-built head like
  the coat of a shaggy dog.</p>
  <p>In absolute contrast to him, Sir Marmaduke looked wonderfully calm and tidy.
  In answer to the other man&rsquo;s eager look of inquiry, he made pretense
  of fumbling in his pockets, as he said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! all of them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As if idly musing, he continued to walk along the path, whilst the smith
  first stooped to pick up a small lantern which he had obviously brought with
  him in order to examine the papers by its light, and then strode in the wake
  of Sir Marmaduke.</p>
  <p>The breeze was getting a bother hold on the mist, and was tossing it about
  from sea to cliff and upwards with more persistence and more vigor.</p>
  <p>The pale, cold moon glistened visibly on the moist atmosphere, and far below
  and far beyond weird streaks of shimmering silver edged the surface of the
  sea. The breeze itself had scarcely stirred the water; or,&mdash;the soft
  sound of tiny billows lapping the outstanding boulders was wafted upwards
  as the tide drew in.</p>
  <p>The two men had reached the edge of the cliff. With a slight laugh, indicative
  of nervousness, Sir Marmaduke had quickly stepped back a pace or two.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have brought the proofs,&rdquo; he said, as if wishing to conciliate
  a dangerous enemy, &ldquo;we need not stand so near the edge, need we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Adam Lambert shrugged his shoulders in token of contempt at the other&rsquo;s
  cowardice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not harm thee,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an thou hast not
  lied to me....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He deposited his lantern by the side of a heap of white chalk, which had,
  no doubt, been collected at some time or other by idle or childish hands,
  and stood close to the edge of the cliff. Sir Marmaduke now took his stand
  beside it, one foot placed higher than the other. Close to him Adam in a
  frenzy of restlessness had thrown himself down on the heap; below them a
  drop of ninety feet to the seaweed covered beach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me see the papers,&rdquo; quoth Adam impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gently, gently, kind sir,&rdquo; said de Chavasse lightly. &ldquo;Did
  you think that you could dictate your own terms quite so easily?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What dost <i>thou</i> mean?&rdquo; queried the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean that I am about to place in your hands the proof that you
  are heir to a title and fifteen thousand pounds a year, but at the same time
  I wish to assure myself that you will be pleasant over certain matters which
  concern me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have I not said that I would hold my tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of a truth you did say so my friend, and therefore, I am convinced
  that you will not refuse to give me a written promise to that effect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot write,&rdquo; said Adam moodily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! just your signature!&rdquo; said de Chavasse pleasantly. &ldquo;You
  can write your name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The initials A. and L. They would satisfy me,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why dost thou want written promises,&rdquo; objected the smith, looking
  up with sullen wrath at Sir Marmaduke. &ldquo;Is not the word of an honest
  man sufficient for thee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite sufficient,&rdquo; rejoined de Chavasse blandly, &ldquo;those
  initials are a mere matter of form. You cannot object if your intentions
  are honest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not object. Hast brought ink or paper?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and the form to which you only need to affix your initials.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke now drew a packet of papers from the inner lining of his doublet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These are the proofs of your parentage,&rdquo; he said lightly.</p>
  <p>Then he took out another single sheet of paper from his pocket, unfolded
  it and handed it to Lambert. &ldquo;Can you read it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>He stooped and picked up the lantern, whilst handing the paper to Adam.
  The smith took the document from him, and Sir Marmaduke held the lantern
  so that he might read.</p>
  <p>Adam Lambert was no scholar. The reading of printed matter was oft a difficulty
  to him, written characters were a vast deal more trouble, but suspicion lurked
  in the smith&rsquo;s mind, and though his very sinews ached with the desire
  to handle the proofs, he would not put his initials to any writing which
  he did not fully comprehend.</p>
  <p>It was all done in a moment. Adam was absorbed in deciphering the contents
  of the paper. De Chavasse held the lantern up with one hand, but at such
  an angle that Lambert was obliged to step back in order to get its full light.</p>
  <p>Then with the other hand, the right, Sir Marmaduke drew a double-edged Italian
  knife from his girdle, and with a rapid and vigorous gesture, drove it straight
  between the smith&rsquo;s shoulder blades.</p>
  <p>Adam uttered a groan:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God ... I am ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he staggered and fell.</p>
  <p>Fell backwards down the edge of the cliff into the mist-enveloped abyss
  below.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke had fallen on one knee and his trembling fingers clutched
  at the thick short grass, sharp as the blade of a knife, to stop himself
  from swooning&mdash;from falling backwards in the wake of Adam the smith.</p>
  <p>A gust of wind wafted the mist upwards, covering him with its humid embrace.
  But he remained quite still, crouching on his stomach now, his hands clutching
  the grass for support, whilst great drops of perspiration mingled with the
  moisture of the mist on his face.</p>
  <p>Anon he raised his head a little and turned to look at the edge of the cliff.
  On hands and knees, like a gigantic reptile, he crawled, then lay flat on
  the ground, on the extreme edge, his eyes peering down into those depths
  wherein floating vapors lolled and stirred, with subtle movements like spirits
  in unrest.</p>
  <p>As far as the murderer&rsquo;s eye could reach and could penetrate the density
  of the fog, white crag succeeded white crag, with innumerable projections
  which should have helped to toss a falling and inert mass as easily as if
  it had been an air bubble.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke tried to penetrate the secrets which the gray and shifting
  veil still hid from his view. Beside him lay the Italian knife, its steely
  surface shimmering in the vaporous light, there where a dull and ruddy stain
  had not dimmed its brilliant polish. The murderer gazed at his tool and shuddered
  feebly. But he picked up the knife and mechanically wiped it in the grass,
  before he restored it to his belt.</p>
  <p>Then he gazed downwards again, straining his eyes to pierce the mist, his
  ears to hear a sound.</p>
  <p>But nothing came upwards from that mighty abyss save the now more distinct
  lapping of the billows round the boulders, for the tide was rapidly setting
  in.</p>
  <p>Down the white sides of the cliff the projections seemed ready to afford
  a foothold bearing somewhat toward the right, the descent was not so abrupt
  as it was immediately in front. The chalk of a truth looked slimy and green,
  and might cause the unwary to trip, but there was that to see down below
  and that to do, which would make any danger of a fall well worth the risking.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse slowly rose to his feet. His knees were still
  shaking under him, and there was a nervous tremor in his jaw and in his wrists
  which he tried vainly to conquer.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless he managed to readjust his clothes, his perruque, his broad-brimmed
  hat. The papers he slipped back into his pocket together with the black silk
  shade and false mustache, then, with the lantern in his left hand he took
  the first steps towards the perilous descent.</p>
  <p>There was something down below that he must see, something that he wished
  to do.</p>
  <p>He walked sidewise at times, bent nearly double, looking like some gigantic
  and unwieldy crab, as the feeble rays of the mist-hidden moon caught his
  rounded back in its cloth doublet of a dull reddish hue. At other times he
  was forced to sit, and to work his way downwards with his hands and heels,
  tearing his clothes, bruising his elbows and his shoulders against the projections
  of the titanic masonry. Lumps of chalk detached themselves from beneath and
  around him and slipped down the precipitous sides in advance of him, with
  a dull reverberating sound which seemed to rouse the echoes of this silent
  night.</p>
  <p>The descent seemed interminable. His flesh ached, his sinews creaked, his
  senses reeled with the pain, the mind-agony, the horror of it all.</p>
  <p>At last he caught a glimmer of the wet sand, less than ten feet below. He
  had just landed on a bit of white tableland wantonly carved in the naked
  cliff. The rough gradients which up to now had guided him in his descent
  ceased abruptly. Behind him the cliff rose upwards, in front and, to his
  right, and left a concave wall, straight down to the beach.</p>
  <p>Exhausted and half-paralyzed, de Chavasse perforce had to throw himself
  down these last ten feet, hardly pausing to think whether his head would
  or would not come in violent contact with one of the chalk boulders which
  stand out here and there in the flat sandy beach.</p>
  <p>He threw down the lantern first, which was extinguished as it fell. Then
  he took the final jump, and soon lay half-unconscious, numbed and aching
  in every limb in the wet sand.</p>
  <p>Anon he tried to move. His limbs were painful, his shoulders ached, and
  he had some difficulty in struggling to his feet. An unusually large boulder
  close by afforded a resting place. He reached it and sat down. His head was
  still swimming but his limbs were apparently sound. He sat quietly for a
  while, recouping his strength, gathering his wandering senses. The lantern
  lay close to his feet, extinguished but not broken.</p>
  <p>He groped for his tinder-box, and having found it, proceeded to relight
  the tiny tallow dip. It was a difficult proceeding for the tinder was damp,
  and the breeze, though very slight in this hollow portion of the cliffs,
  nevertheless was an enemy to a trembling little flame.</p>
  <p>But Sir Marmaduke noted with satisfaction that his nerves were already under
  his control. He succeeded in relighting the lantern, which he could not have
  done if his hands had been as unsteady as they were awhile ago.</p>
  <p>He rose once more to his feet, stamped them against the boulders, stretched
  out his arms, giving his elbows and shoulders full play. Mayhap he had spent
  a quarter of an hour thus resting since that final jump, mayhap it had been
  an hour or two; he could not say for time had ceased to be.</p>
  <p>But the mist had penetrated to his very bones and he did not remember ever
  having felt quite so cold.</p>
  <p>Now he seized his lantern and began his search, trying to ascertain the
  exact position of the portion of the cliff&rsquo;s edge where he and Lambert
  the smith had been standing a while ago.</p>
  <p>It was not a difficult matter, nor was the search a long one. Soon he saw
  a huddled mass lying in the sand.</p>
  <p>He went up to it and placed the lantern down upon a boulder.</p>
  <p>Horror had entirely left him. The crisis of terror at his own fell deed
  had been terrible but brief. His was not a nature to shrink from unpleasant
  sights, nor at such times do men have cause to recoil from contact with the
  dead.</p>
  <p>In the murderer&rsquo;s heart there was no real remorse for the crime which
  he had committed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah! why did the fool get in my way?&rdquo; was the first mental
  comment which he made when he caught sight of Lambert&rsquo;s body.</p>
  <p>Then with a final shrug of the shoulders he dismissed pity, horror or remorse,
  entirely from his thoughts.</p>
  <p>What he now did was to raise the smith&rsquo;s body from the ground and
  to strip it of its clothing. &rsquo;Twas a grim task, on which his chroniclers
  have never cared to dwell. His purpose was fixed. He had planned and thought
  it all out minutely, and he was surely not the man to flinch at the execution
  of a project once he had conceived it.</p>
  <p>The death of Adam Lambert should serve a double purpose: the silencing of
  an avowed enemy and the wiping out of the personality of Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans.</p>
  <p>The latter was as important as the first. It would facilitate the realizing
  of the fortune and, above all, clear the way for Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s future
  life.</p>
  <p>Therefore, however gruesome the task, which was necessary in order to attain
  that great goal, the schemer accomplished it, with set teeth and an unwavering
  hand.</p>
  <p>What he did do on that lonely fog-ridden beach and in the silence of that
  dank and misty night, was to dress up the body of Adam Lambert, the smith,
  in the fantastic clothing of Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans:
  the red cloth doublet, the lace collars and cuffs, the bunches of ribbon
  at knee and waist, and the black silk shade over the left eye. All he omitted
  were the perruque and the false mustache.</p>
  <p>Having accomplished this work, he himself donned the clothes of Adam Lambert.</p>
  <p>This part of his task being done, he had to rest for a while. &rsquo;Tis
  no easy matter to undress and redress an inert mass.</p>
  <p>The smith, dressed in the elaborate accouterments of the mysterious French
  prince, now lay face upwards on the sand.</p>
  <p>The tide was rapidly setting in. In less than half an hour it would reach
  this portion of the beach.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, however, had not yet accomplished all that he
  meant to do. He knew that the sea-waves had a habit of returning that which
  they took away. Therefore, his purpose was not fully accomplished when he
  had dressed the dead smith in the clothes of the Orl&eacute;ans prince. Else
  had he wished it, he could have consigned his victim to the tide.</p>
  <p>But Adam&mdash;dead&mdash;had now to play a part in the grim comedy which
  Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse had designed for his own safety, and the more assured
  success of all his frauds and plans.</p>
  <p>Therefore, after a brief rest, the murderer set to work again. A more grim
  task yet! one from which of a truth more than one evil-doer would recoil.</p>
  <p>Not so this bold schemer, this mad worshiper of money and of self. Everything!
  anything for the safety of Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, for the peaceful possession
  of &pound;500,000.</p>
  <p>Everything! Even the desecration of the dead!</p>
  <p>The murderer was powerful, and there is a strength which madness gives.
  Heavy boulders pushed by vigorous arms had to help in the monstrous deed!</p>
  <p>Heavy boulders thrown and rolled over the face of the dead, so as to obliterate
  all identity!</p>
  <p>Nay! had a sound now disturbed the silence of this awesome night, surely
  it had been the laughter of demons aghast at such a deed!</p>
  <p>The moon indeed hid her face, retreating once more behind the veils of mist.
  The breeze itself was lulled and the fog gathered itself together and wrapped
  the unavowable horrors of the night in a gray and ghoul-like shroud.</p>
  <p>Madness lurked in the eyes of the sacrilegious murderer. Madness which helped
  him not only to carry his grim task to the end, but, having accomplished
  it, to see that it was well done.</p>
  <p>And his hand did not tremble, as he raised the lantern and looked down on <i>that</i> which
  had once been Adam Lambert, the smith.</p>
  <p>Nay, had those laughing demons looked on it, they would have veiled their
  faces in awe!</p>
  <p>The gentle wavelets of the torpid tide were creeping round that thing in
  red doublet and breeches, in high top boots, lace cuffs and collar.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke looked down calmly upon his work, and did not even shudder
  with horror.</p>
  <p>Madness had been upon him and had numbed his brain.</p>
  <p>But the elemental instinct of self-preservation whispered to him that his
  work was well done.</p>
  <p>When the sea gave up the dead, only the clothes, the doublet, the ribands,
  the lace, the black shade, mayhap, would reveal his identity, as the mysterious
  French prince who for a brief while had lodged in a cottage at Acol.</p>
  <p>But the face was unrecognizable.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter33"></a>Chapter 33<br>
  The Day After</b></h2>
  <p>The feeling which prevailed in Thanet with regard to the murder of the mysterious
  foreigner on the sands of Epple Bay was chiefly one of sullen resentment.</p>
  <p>Here was a man who had come from goodness knows where, whose strange wanderings
  and secret appearances in the neighborhood had oft roused the anger of the
  village folk, just as his fantastic clothes, his silken doublet and befrilled
  shirt had excited their scorn; here was a man, I say, who came from nowhere,
  and now he chose&mdash;the yokels of the neighborhood declared it that he
  chose&mdash;to make his exit from the world in as weird a manner as he had
  effected his entrance into this remote and law-abiding little island.</p>
  <p>The farmhands and laborers who dwelt in the cottages dotted about around
  St. Nicholas-at-Wade, Epple or Acol were really angry with the stranger for
  allowing himself to be murdered on their shores. Thanet itself had up to
  now enjoyed a fair reputation for orderliness and temperance, and that one
  of her inhabitants should have been tempted to do away with that interloping
  foreigner in such a violent manner was obviously the fault of that foreigner
  himself.</p>
  <p>The watches had found him on the sands at low tide. One of them walking
  along the brow of the cliff had seen the dark object lying prone amongst
  the boulders, a black mass in the midst of the whiteness of the chalk.</p>
  <p>The whole thing was shocking, no doubt, gruesome in the extreme, but the
  mystery which surrounded this strange death had roused ire rather than horror.</p>
  <p>Of course the news had traveled slowly from cottage to cottage, although
  Petty Constable Pyot, who resided at St. Nicholas, had immediately apprised
  Squire Boatfield and Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse of the awesome discovery made
  by the watches on the sands of Epple Bay.</p>
  <p>Squire Boatfield was major-general of the district and rode over from Sarre
  directly he heard the news. The body in the meanwhile had been placed under
  the shelter of one of the titanic caves which giant hands have carved in
  the acclivities of the chalk. Squire Boatfield ordered it to be removed.
  It was not fitting that birds of prey should be allowed to peck at the dead,
  nor that some unusually high tide should once more carry him out to sea,
  ere his murderer had been brought to justice.</p>
  <p>Therefore, the foreigner with the high-sounding name was conveyed by the
  watches at the squire&rsquo;s bidding to the cottage of the Lamberts over
  at Acol, the only place in Thanet which he had ever called his home.</p>
  <p>The old Quakeress, wrathful and sullen, had scarce understood what the whole
  pother was about. She was hard of hearing, and Petty Constable Pyot was at
  great pains to explain to her that by the major-general&rsquo;s orders the
  body of the murdered man should be laid decently under shelter, until such
  time as proper burial could be arranged for it.</p>
  <p>Fortunately before the small cort&egrave;ge bearing the gruesome burden
  had arrived at the cottage, young Richard Lambert had succeeded in making
  the old woman understand what was expected of her.</p>
  <p>Even then she flatly and obstinately refused to have the stranger brought
  into her house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was a heathen,&rdquo; she declared emphatically, &ldquo;his soul
  hath mayhap gone to hell. His thoughts were evil, and God had him not in
  His keeping. &rsquo;Tis not fit that the mortal hulk of a damned soul should
  pollute the saintliness of mine own abode.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pyot thought that the old woman was raving, but Master Lambert very peremptorily
  forbade him to interfere with her. The young man, though quite calm, looked
  dangerous&mdash;so thought the petty constable&mdash;and between them, the
  old Quakeress and the young student defied the constables and the watches
  and barred the cottage to the entrance of the dead.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, the smith was from home. Pyot thought that the latter had
  been more reasonable, that he would have understood the weight of authority,
  and also of seemliness, which was of equally grave importance.</p>
  <p>There was a good deal of parleying before it was finally decided to place
  the body in the forge, which was a wooden lean-to, resting against the north
  wall of the cottage. There was no direct access from the cottage to the forge,
  and old Mistress Lambert seemed satisfied that the foreigner should rest
  there, at any rate until the smith came home, when, mayhap, he would decide
  otherwise.</p>
  <p>At the instance of the petty constable she even brought out a sheet, which
  smelt sweetly of lavender, and gave it to the watchmen, so that they might
  decently cover up the dead; she also gave them three elm chairs on which
  to lay him down.</p>
  <p>Across those three chairs the body now lay, covered over with the lavender-scented
  sheet, in the corner of the blacksmith&rsquo;s forge, over by the furnace.
  A watchman stayed beside it, to ward off sacrilege: anyone who desired could
  come, and could&mdash;if his nerves were strong enough&mdash;view the body
  and state if, indeed, it was that of the foreigner who all through last summer
  had haunted the woods and park of Acol.</p>
  <p>Of a truth there was no doubt at all as to the identity of the dead. His
  fantastic clothes were unmistakable. Many there were who had seen him wandering
  in the woods of nights, and several could swear to the black silk shade and
  the broad-brimmed hat which the watchmen had found&mdash;high and dry&mdash;on
  a chalk boulder close to where the body lay.</p>
  <p>Mistress Lambert had refused to look on the dead. &rsquo;Twas, of course,
  no fit sight for females, and the constable had not insisted thereon: but
  she knew the black silk shade again, and young Master Lambert had caught
  sight of the murdered man&rsquo;s legs and feet, and had thereupon recognized
  the breeches and the quaint boots with their overwide tops filled with frills
  of lace.</p>
  <p>Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy, too, though unwilling to see a corpse, thought
  it his duty to help the law in investigating this mysterious crime. He had
  oft seen the foreigner of nights in the park, and never doubted for a moment
  that the body which lay across the elm chairs in the smith&rsquo;s forge
  was indeed that of the stranger.</p>
  <p>Squire Boatfield was now quite satisfied that the identity of the victim
  was firmly established, and anon he did his best&mdash;being a humane man&mdash;to
  obtain Christian burial for the stranger. After some demur, the parson at
  Minster declared himself willing to do the pious deed.</p>
  <p>Heathen or not, &rsquo;twas not for Christian folk to pass judgment on him
  who no longer now could give an explanation of his own mysterious doings,
  and had of a truth carried his secrets with him in silence to the grave.</p>
  <p>Was it not strange that anyone should have risked the gallows for the sake
  of putting out of the way a man who of a surety was not worth powder or shot?</p>
  <p>And the nerve and strength which the murderer had shown! ... displacing
  great boulders with which to batter in his victim&rsquo;s face so that not
  even his own kith and kin could recognize that now!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter34"></a>Chapter 34<br>
  Afterwards</b></h2>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse cursed the weather and cursed himself for being
  a fool.</p>
  <p>He had started from Acol Court on horseback, riding an old nag, for the
  roads were heavy with mud, and the short cut through the woods quite impassable.</p>
  <p>The icy downpour beat against his face and lashed the poor mare&rsquo;s
  ears and mane until she tossed her head about blindly and impatiently, scarce
  heeding where she placed her feet. The rider&rsquo;s cloak was already soaked
  through, and soon even his shirt clung dank and cold to his aching back;
  the bridle was slippery with the wet, and his numbed fingers could hardly
  feel its resistance as the mare went stumbling on her way.</p>
  <p>Beside horse and rider, Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy and Master Courage Toogood
  walked ankle-deep in mud&mdash;one on each side of the mare, and lantern
  in hand, for the shades of evening would have drawn in ere the return journey
  could be undertaken. The two men had taken off their shoes and stockings
  and had slung them over their shoulders, for &rsquo;twas better to walk barefoot
  than to feel the icy moisture soaking through leather and worsted.</p>
  <p>It was then close on two o&rsquo;clock of an unusually bleak November afternoon.
  The winds of Heaven, which of a truth do oft use the isle of Thanet as a
  meeting place, wherein to discuss the mischief which they severally intend
  to accomplish in sundry quarters later on, had been exceptionally active
  this day. The southwesterly hurricane had brought, a deluge of rain with
  it a couple of hours ago, then&mdash;satisfied with this prowess&mdash;had
  handed the downpour over to his brother of the northeast, who breathing on
  it with his icy breath, had soon converted it into sleet: whereupon he turned
  his back on the mainland altogether, and wandered out towards the ocean,
  determined to worry the deep-sea fishermen who were out with their nets:
  but not before he had deputed his brother of the northeast to marshal his
  army of snow-laden cloud on the firmament.</p>
  <p>This the northeast, was over-ready to do, and in answer to his whim a leaden,
  inky pall now lay over Thanet, whilst the gale continued its mighty, wanton
  frolic, lashing the sleet against the tiny window-panes of the cottage, or
  sending it down the chimneys, upon the burning logs below, causing them to
  splutter and to hiss ere they changed their glow to black and smoking embers.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twere impossible to imagine a more discomforting atmosphere in which
  to be abroad: yet Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse was trudging through the mire,
  and getting wet to the skin, even when he might just as well be sitting beside
  the fire in the withdrawing-room at the Court.</p>
  <p>He was on his way to the smith&rsquo;s forge at Acol and had ordered his
  serving-men to accompany him thither: and of a truth neither of them were
  loath to go. They cared naught about the weather, and the excitement which
  centered round the Quakeress&rsquo;s cottage at Acol more than counterbalanced
  the discomfort of a tramp through the mud.</p>
  <p>A rumor had reached the Court that the funeral of the murdered man would,
  mayhap, take place this day, and Master Busy would not have missed such an
  event for the world, not though the roads lay thick with snow and the drifts
  rendered progress impossible to all save to the keenest enthusiast. He for
  one was glad enough that his master had seemed so unaccountably anxious for
  the company of his own serving men. Sir Marmaduke had ever been overfond
  of wandering about the lonely woods of Thanet alone.</p>
  <p>But since that gruesome murder on the beach forty-eight hours ago and more,
  both the quality and the yokels preferred to venture abroad in company.</p>
  <p>At the same time neither Master Busy nor young Courage Toogood could imagine
  why Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse should endure such amazing discomfort in order
  to attend the funeral of an obscure adventurer, who of a truth was as naught
  to him.</p>
  <p>Nor, if the truth were known, could Sir Marmaduke himself have accounted
  for his presence here on this lonely road, and on one of the most dismal,
  bleak and unpleasant afternoons that had ever been experienced in Thanet
  of late.</p>
  <p>He should at this moment have been on the other side of the North Sea. The
  most elemental prudence should indeed have counseled an immediate journey
  to Amsterdam and a prompt negotiation of all marketable securities which
  Lady Sue Aldmarshe had placed in his hands.</p>
  <p>Yet twice twenty-four hours had gone by since that awful night, when, having
  finally relinquished his victim to the embrace of the tide, he had picked
  his way up the chalk cliffs and through the terror-haunted woods to his own
  room in Acol Court.</p>
  <p>He should have left for abroad the next day, ere the news of the discovery
  of a mysterious murder had reached the precincts of his own park. But he
  had remained in England. Something seemed to have rooted him to the spot,
  something to be holding him back whenever he was ready to flee.</p>
  <p>At first it had been a mere desire to know. On the morning following his
  crime he made a vigorous effort to rally his scattered senses, to walk, to
  move, and to breathe as if nothing had happened, as if nothing lay out there
  on the sands of Epple, high and dry now, for the tide would have gone out.</p>
  <p>Whether he had slept or not since the moment when he had crept stealthily
  into his own house, silently as the bird of prey when returning to its nest&mdash;he
  could not have said. Undoubtedly he had stripped off the dead man&rsquo;s
  clothes, the rough shirt and cord breeches which had belonged to Lambert,
  the smith. Undoubtedly, too, he had made a bundle of these things, hiding
  them in a dark recess at the bottom of an old oak cupboard which stood in
  his room. With these clothes he had placed the leather wallet which contained
  securities worth half a million of solid money.</p>
  <p>All this he had done, preparatory to destroying the clothes by fire, and
  to converting the securities into money abroad. After that he had thrown
  himself on the bed, without thought, without sensations save those of bodily
  ache and of numbing fatigue.</p>
  <p>Vaguely, as the morning roused him to consciousness, he realized that he
  must leave for Dover as soon as may be and cross over to France by the first
  packet available, or, better still, by boat specially chartered. And yet,
  when anon he rose and dressed, he felt at once that he would not go just
  yet; that he could not go until certain queries which had formed in his brain
  had been answered by events.</p>
  <p>How soon would the watches find the body? Having found it, what would they
  do? Would the body be immediately identified by the clothes upon it? or would
  doubt on that score arise in the minds of the neighboring folk? Would the
  disappearance of Adam Lambert be known at once and commented upon in connection
  with the crime?</p>
  <p>Curiosity soon became an obsession; he wandered down into the hall where
  the serving-wench was plying her duster. He searched her face, wondering
  if she had heard the news.</p>
  <p>The mist of the night had yielded to an icy drizzle, but Sir Marmaduke could
  not remain within. His footsteps guided him in the direction of Acol, on
  towards Epple Bay. On the path which leads to the edge of the cliffs he met
  the watches who were tramping on towards the beach.</p>
  <p>The men saluted him and went on their way, but he turned and fled as quickly
  as he dared.</p>
  <p>In the afternoon Master Busy brought the news down from Prospect Inn. The
  body of the man who had called himself a French prince had been found murdered
  and shockingly mutilated on the sands at Epple. Sir Marmaduke was vastly
  interested. He, usually so reserved and ill-humored with his servants, had
  kept Hymn-of-Praise in close converse for nigh upon an hour, asking many
  questions about the crime, about the petty constables&rsquo; action in the
  matter and the comments made by the village folk.</p>
  <p>At the same time he gave strict injunctions to Master Busy not to breathe
  a word of the gruesome subject to the ladies, nor yet to the serving-wench; &rsquo;twas
  not a matter fit for women&rsquo;s ears.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke then bade his butler push on as far as Acol, to glean further
  information about the mysterious event.</p>
  <p>That evening he collected all the clothes which had belonged to Lambert,
  the smith, and wrapping up the leather wallet with them which contained the
  securities, he carried this bundle to the lonely pavilion on the outskirts
  of the park.</p>
  <p>He was not yet ready to go abroad.</p>
  <p>Master Busy returned from his visit to Acol full of what he had seen. He
  had been allowed to view the body, and to swear before Squire Boatfield that
  he recognized the clothes as being those usually worn by the mysterious foreigner
  who used to haunt the woods and park of Acol all last summer.</p>
  <p>Hymn-of-Praise had his full meed of pleasure that evening, and the next
  day, too, for Sir Marmaduke seemed never tired of hearing him recount all
  the gossip which obtained at Acol and at St. Nicholas: the surmises as to
  the motive of the horrible crime, the talk about the stranger and his doings,
  the resentment caused by his weird demise, and the conjectures as to what
  could have led a miscreant to do away with so insignificant a personage.</p>
  <p>All that day&mdash;the second since the crime&mdash;Sir Marmaduke still
  lingered in Thanet. Prudence whispered urgent counsels that he should go,
  and yet he stayed, watching the progress of events with that same morbid
  and tenacious curiosity.</p>
  <p>And now it was the thought of what folk would say when they heard that Adam
  Lambert had disappeared, and was, of a truth, not returning home, which kept
  Sir Marmaduke still lingering in England.</p>
  <p>That and the inexplicable enigma which ever confronts the searcher of human
  motives: the overwhelming desire of the murderer to look once again upon
  his victim.</p>
  <p>Master Busy had on that second morning brought home the news from Acol,
  that Squire Boatfield had caused a rough deal coffin to be made by the village
  carpenter at the expense of the county, and that mayhap the stranger would
  be laid therein this very afternoon and conveyed down to Minster, where he
  would be accorded Christian burial.</p>
  <p>Then Sir Marmaduke realized that it would be impossible for him to leave
  England until after he had gazed once more on the dead body of the smith.</p>
  <p>After that he would go. He would shake the sand of Thanet from his heels
  forever.</p>
  <p>When he had learned all that he wished to know he would be free from the
  present feeling of terrible obsession which paralyzed his movements to the
  extent of endangering his own safely.</p>
  <p>He was bound to look upon his victim once again: an inexplicable and titanic
  force compelled him to that. Mayhap, that same force would enable him to
  keep his nerves under control when, presently, he should be face to face
  with the dead.</p>
  <p>Face to face? ... Good God! ...</p>
  <p>Yet neither fear nor remorse haunted him. It was only curosity, and, at
  one thought, a nameless horror! ... Not at the thought of murder ... there
  he had no compunction, but at that of the terrible deed which from instinct
  of self-protection had perforce to succeed the graver crime.</p>
  <p>The weight of those chalk boulders seemed still to weigh against the muscles
  of his back. He felt that Sisyphus-like he was forever rolling, rolling a
  gigantic stone which, failing of its purpose&mdash;recoiled on him, rolling
  back down a precipitous incline, and crushing him beneath its weight ...
  only to release him again ... to leave him free to endure the same torture
  over and over again ... and yet again ... forever the same weight ... forever
  the self-same, intolerable agony....</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter35"></a>Chapter 35<br>
  The Smith&rsquo;s Forge</b></h2>
  <p>Up to the hour of his departure from Acol Court, Sir Marmaduke had been
  convinced that neither his sister-in-law nor Lady Sue had heard of the news
  which had set the whole of Thanet in commotion. Acol Court lies very isolated,
  well off the main Canterbury Road, and just for two days and a half Master
  Hymn-of-Praise Busy had contrived to hold his tongue.</p>
  <p>Most of the village gossips, too, met at the local public bars, and had
  had up to now no time to wander as far as the Court, nor any reason to do
  so, seeing that Master Busy was always to be found at Prospect Inn and always
  ready to discuss the mystery in all its bearings, with anyone who would share
  a pint of ale with him.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke had taken jealous care only to meet the ladies at meal-time,
  and under penalty of immediate dismissal had forbidden Hymn-of-Praise to
  speak to the serving-wench of the all-absorbing topic.</p>
  <p>So far Master Busy had obeyed, but at the last moment, just before starting
  for Acol village, Sir Marmaduke had caught sight of Mistress Charity talking
  to the stableman in the yard. Something in the wench&rsquo;s eyes told him&mdash;with
  absolute certainty that she had just heard of the murder.</p>
  <p>That morbid and tenacious curiosity once more got hold of him. He would
  have given all he possessed at this moment&mdash;the entire fruits of his
  crime perhaps&mdash;to know what that ignorant girl thought of it all, and
  it caused him acute, almost physical pain, to refrain from questioning her.</p>
  <p>There was enough of the sense of self-protection in him, however, to check
  himself from betraying such extraordinary interest in the matter: but he
  turned on his heel and went quickly back to the house. He wanted to catch
  sight of Editha&rsquo;s face, if only for a moment; he wanted to see for
  himself, then and there, if she had also heard the news.</p>
  <p>As he entered the hall, she was coming down the stairs. She had on her cloak
  and hood as if preparing to go out. Their eyes met and he saw that she knew.</p>
  <p>Knew what? He broke into a loud and fierce laugh as he met her wildly questioning
  gaze. There was a look almost of madness in the hopeless puzzlement of her
  expression.</p>
  <p>Of course Editha must be hopelessly puzzled. The very thought of her vague
  conjecturings had caused him to laugh as maniacs laugh at times.</p>
  <p>The mysterious French prince had been found on the sands murdered and mutilated....
  But then ...</p>
  <p>Still laughing, Sir Marmaduke once more turned, running away from the house
  now and never pausing until his foot had touched the stirrup and his fingers
  were entangled in the damp mane of the mare. Even whilst he settled himself
  into the saddle as comfortably as he could, the grim humor of Editha&rsquo;s
  bewilderment caused him to laugh, within himself.</p>
  <p>The nag stepped slowly along in the mud at first, then broke into a short
  trot. The two serving-men had started on ahead with their lanterns; they
  would, of course, be walking all the way.</p>
  <p>The icy rain mingled with tiny flakes of snow was insufferably cutting and
  paralyzing: yet Sir Marmaduke scarcely heeded it, until the mare became unpleasantly
  uncertain in her gait. Once she stumbled and nearly pitched her rider forward
  into the mud: whereupon, lashing into her, he paid more heed to her doings.</p>
  <p>Once just past the crossroad toward St. Nicholas, he all but turned his
  horse&rsquo;s head back towards Acol Court. It seemed as if he must find
  out now at once whether Editha had spoken to Lady Sue and what the young
  girl had done and said when she heard, in effect, that her husband had been
  murdered.</p>
  <p>Nothing but the fear of missing the last look at the body of Adam Lambert
  ere the lid of the coffin was nailed down stopped him from returning homewards.</p>
  <p>Anon he came upon Busy and Toogood painfully trudging in the mire, and singing
  lustily to keep themselves cheerful and warm.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke drew the mare in, so as to keep pace with his men. On the
  whole, the road had been more lonely than he liked and he was glad of company.</p>
  <p>Outside the Lamberts&rsquo; cottage a small crowd had collected. From the
  crest of the hill the tiny bell of Acol church struck the hour of two.</p>
  <p>Squire Boatfield had ridden over from Sarre, and Sir Marmaduke&mdash;as
  he dismounted&mdash;caught sight of the heels and crupper of the squire&rsquo;s
  well-known cob. The little crowd had gathered in the immediate neighborhood
  of the forge, and de Chavasse, from where he now stood, could not see the
  entrance of the lean-to, only the blank side wall of the shed, and the front
  of the Lamberts&rsquo; cottage, the doors and windows of which were hermetically
  closed.</p>
  <p>Up against the angle formed by the wall of the forge and that of the cottage,
  the enterprising landlord of the local inn had erected a small trestle table,
  from behind which he was dispensing spiced ale, and bottled Spanish wines.</p>
  <p>Squire Boatfield was standing beside that improvised bar, and at sight of
  Sir Marmaduke he put down the pewter mug which he was in the act of conveying
  to his lips, and came forward to greet his friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is the pother about this foreigner, eh, Boatfield?&rdquo; queried
  de Chavasse with gruff good-nature as he shook hands with the squire and
  allowed himself to be led towards that tempting array of bottles and mugs
  on the trestle table.</p>
  <p>The yokels who were assembled at the entrance of the forge turned to gaze
  with some curiosity at the squire of Acol. De Chavasse was not often seen
  even in this village: he seldom went beyond the boundary of his own park.</p>
  <p>All the men touched their forelocks with deferential respect. Master Jeremy
  Mounce humbly whispered a query as to what His Honor would condescend to
  take.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke desired a mug of buttered ale or of lamb&rsquo;s wool, which
  Master Mounce soon held ready for him. He emptied the mug at one draught.
  The spiced liquor went coursing through his body, and he felt better and
  more sure of himself. He desired a second mug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With more substance in it, Master Landlord,&rdquo; he said pleasantly. &ldquo;Nay,
  man! ye are not giving milk to children, but something warm to cheer a man&rsquo;s
  inside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have a half bottle of brandy here, good Sir Marmaduke,&rdquo; suggested
  Master Mounce with some diffidence, for brandy was an over-expensive commodity
  which not many Kentish squires cared to afford.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brandy, of course, good master!&rdquo; quoth de Chavasse lustily, &ldquo;brandy
  is the nectar of the gods. Here!&rdquo; he added, drawing a piece of gold
  from a tiny pocket concealed in the lining of his doublet, &ldquo;will this
  pay for thy half-bottle of nectar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Over well, good Sir Marmaduke,&rdquo; said Master Mounce, as he stooped
  to the ground. From underneath the table he now drew forth a glass and a
  bottle: the latter he uncorked with slow and deliberate care, and then filled
  the glass with its contents, whilst Sir Marmaduke watched him with impatient
  eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you join me, squire?&rdquo; asked de Chavasse, as he lifted
  the small tumbler and gazed with marked appreciation at the glistening and
  transparent liquid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, thanks,&rdquo; replied Boatfield with a laugh, &ldquo;I care
  naught for these foreign decoctions. Another mug, or even two, of buttered
  ale, good landlord,&rdquo; he added, turning to Master Mounce.</p>
  <p>In the meanwhile petty constable Pyot had stood respectfully at attention
  ready to relate for the hundredth time, mayhap, all that he knew and all
  that he meant to know about the mysterious crime.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke would of a surety ask many questions, for it was passing strange
  that he had taken but little outward interest in the matter up to now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Pyot,&rdquo; he now said, beckoning to the man to approach, &ldquo;tell
  us what you know. By Gad, &rsquo;tis not often we indulge in a genuine murder
  in Thanet! Where was it done? Not on my land, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The watches found the body on the beach, your Honor,&rdquo; replied
  Pyot, &ldquo;the head was mutilated past all recognition ... the heavy chalk
  boulders, your Honor ... and a determined maniac methinks, sir, who wanted
  revenge against a personal enemy.... Else how to account for such a brutal
  act? ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; quoth Sir Marmaduke lightly, as he sipped the brandy, &ldquo;that
  the identity of the man has been quite absolutely determined.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! aye! your Honor,&rdquo; rejoined Pyot gravely, &ldquo;the opinion
  of all those who have seen the body is that it is that of a foreigner ...
  Prince of Orleans he called himself, who has been lodging these past months
  at this place here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the petty constable gave a quick nod in the direction of the cottage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! I know but little about him,&rdquo; now said Sir Marmaduke, turning
  to speak to Squire Boatfield, &ldquo;although he lived here, on what is my
  own property, and haunted my park, too ... so I&rsquo;ve been told. There
  was a good deal of talk about him among the wenches in the village.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! I had heard all about that prince,&rdquo; said Squire Boatfield
  meditatively, &ldquo;lodging in this cottage ... &rsquo;twas passing strange.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was a curious sort of man, your Honor,&rdquo; here interposed
  Pyot. &ldquo;We got what information about him we could, seeing that the
  smith is from home, and that Mistress Lambert, his aunt, I think, is hard
  of hearing, and gave us many crooked answers. But she told us that the stranger
  paid for his lodging regularly, and would arrive at the cottage unawares
  of an evening and stay part of the night ... then he would go off again at
  cock-crow, and depart she knew not whither.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man paused in his narrative. Something apparently had caused Sir Marmaduke
  to turn giddy.</p>
  <p>He tugged at his neckbands and his hand fell heavily against the trestle-table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! &rsquo;tis nothing,&rdquo; he said with a harsh laugh as Master
  Mounce with an ejaculation of deep concern ran round to him with a chair,
  whilst Squire Boatfield quickly put out an arm as if he were afraid that
  his friend would fall. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis nothing,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;the
  tramp in the cold, then this heady draught.... I am well I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He drank half a glass of brandy at a draught, and now the hand which replaced
  the glass upon the table had not the slightest tremor in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis all vastly interesting,&rdquo; he remarked lightly. &ldquo;Have
  you seen the body, Boatfield?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! aye!&rdquo; quoth the squire, speaking with obvious reluctance,
  for he hated this gruesome subject. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no pleasant sight.
  And were I in your shoes, de Chavasse, I would not go in there,&rdquo; and
  he nodded significantly towards the forge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! &rsquo;tis my duty as a magistrate,&rdquo; said Sir Marmaduke
  airily.</p>
  <p>He had to steady himself against the table again for a moment or two, ere
  he turned his back on the hospitable board, and started to walk round towards
  the forge: no doubt the shaking of his knees was attributable to the strong
  liquor which he had consumed.</p>
  <p>The little crowd parted and dispersed at his approach. The lean-to wherein
  Adam Lambert was wont to do his work consisted of four walls, one of which
  was that of the cottage, whilst the other immediately facing it, had a wide
  opening which formed the only entrance to the shed. A man standing in that
  entrance would have the furnace on his left: and now in addition to that
  furnace also the three elm chairs, whereon rested a rough deal case, without
  a lid, but partly covered with a sheet.</p>
  <p>To anyone coming from the outside, this angle of the forge would always
  seem weird and even mysterious even when the furnace was blazing and the
  sparks flying from the anvil, beneath the smith&rsquo;s powerful blows, or
  when&mdash;as at present&mdash;the fires were extinguished and this part
  of the shed, innocent of windows, was in absolute darkness.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke paused a moment under the lintel which dominated the broad
  entrance. His eyes had some difficulty in penetrating the density which seemed
  drawn across the place on his left like some ink-smeared and opaque curtain.</p>
  <p>The men assembled outside, watched him from a distance with silent respect.
  In these days the fact of a gentleman drinking more liquor than was good
  for him was certes not to his discredit.</p>
  <p>The fact that Sir Marmaduke seemed to sway visibly on his legs, as he thus
  stood for a moment outlined against the dark interior beyond, roused no astonishment
  in the minds of those who saw him.</p>
  <p>Presently he turned deliberately to his left and the next moment his figure
  was merged in the gloom.</p>
  <p>Round the angle of the wall Squire Boatfield was still standing, sipping
  buttered ale.</p>
  <p>Less than two minutes later, Sir Marmaduke reappeared in the doorway. His
  face was a curious color, and there were beads of perspiration on his forehead,
  and as he came forward he would have fallen, had not one of the men stepped
  quickly up to him and offered a steadying arm. But there was nothing strange
  in that.</p>
  <p>The sight of that which lay in Adam Lambert&rsquo;s forge had unmanned a
  good many ere this.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am inclined to believe, my good Boatfield,&rdquo; quoth Sir Marmaduke,
  as he went back to the trestle-table, and poured himself out another half-glass
  full of brandy, &ldquo;I am inclined to believe that when you advised me
  not to go in there, you spoke words of wisdom which I had done well to follow.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter36"></a>Chapter 36<br>
  The Girl-Wife</b></h2>
  <p>But the effort of the past few moments had been almost more than Marmaduke
  de Chavasse could bear.</p>
  <p>Anon when the church bell over at Acol began a slow and monotonous toll
  he felt as if his every nerve must give way: as if he must laugh, laugh loudly
  and long at the idiocy, the ignorance of all these people who thought that
  they were confronted by an impenetrable mystery, whereas it was all so simple
  ... so very, very simple.</p>
  <p>He had a curious feeling as if he must grip every one of these men here
  by the throat and demand from each one separately an account of what he thought
  and felt, what he surmised and what he guessed when standing face to face
  with the weird enigma presented by that mutilated thing in its rough deal
  case. He would have given worlds to know what his friend Boatfield thought
  of it all, or what had been the petty constable&rsquo;s conjectures.</p>
  <p>A haunting and devilish desire seized him to break open the skulls of all
  these yokels and to look into their brains. Above all now the silence of
  the cottage close to him had become unendurable torment. That closed door,
  the tiny railing which surrounded the bit of front garden, that little gate
  the latch of which he himself so oft had lifted, all seemed to hold the key
  to some terrible mystery, the answer to some fearful riddle which he felt
  would drive him mad if he could not hit upon it now at once.</p>
  <p>The brandy had fired his veins: he no longer felt numb with the cold. A
  passion of rage was seething in him, and he longed to attack with fists and
  heels those curtained windows which now looked like eyes turned mutely and
  inquiringly upon him.</p>
  <p>But there was enough sanity in him yet to prevent his doing anything rash:
  an uncontrolled act might cause astonishment, suspicion mayhap, in the minds
  of those who witnessed it. He made a violent effort to steady himself even
  now, above all to steady his voice and to veil that excited glitter which
  he knew must be apparent in his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meseems that &rsquo;tis somewhat strange,&rdquo; he said quite calmly,
  even lightly, to Squire Boatfield who seemed to be preparing to go, &ldquo;that
  these people&mdash;the Lamberts&mdash;who alone knew the ... the murdered
  man intimately, should keep so persistently, so determinedly out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even while the words escaped his mouth&mdash;certes involuntarily&mdash;he
  knew that the most elementary prudence should have dictated silence on this
  score, and at this juncture. The man was about to be buried, the disappearance
  of the smith had passed off so far without comment. Peace, the eternal peace
  of the grave, would soon descend on the weird events which occupied everyone&rsquo;s
  mind for the present.</p>
  <p>What the old Quakeress thought and felt, what Richard&mdash;the brother&mdash;feared
  and conjectured was easy for Sir Marmaduke to guess: for him, but for no
  one else. To these others the silence of the cottage, the absence of the
  Lamberts from this gathering was simple enough of explanation, seeing that
  they themselves felt such bitter resentment against the dead man. They quite
  felt with the old woman&rsquo;s sullenness, her hatred of the foreigner who
  had disturbed the serenity of her life.</p>
  <p>Everyone else was willing to let her be, not to drag her and young Lambert
  into the unpleasant vortex of these proceedings. Their home was an abode
  of mourning: it was proper and seemly for them to remain concealed and silent
  within their cottage; seemly, too, to have curtained their windows and closed
  their doors.</p>
  <p>No one wished to disturb them; no one but Sir Marmaduke, and with him it
  was once again that morbid access of curiosity, the passionate, intense desire
  to know and to probe every tiny detail in connection with his own crime.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The old woman Lambert should be made to identify the body, before
  it is buried,&rdquo; he now repeated with angry emphasis, seeing that a look
  of disapproval had crossed Squire Boatfield&rsquo;s pleasant face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are satisfied as to the man&rsquo;s identity,&rdquo; rejoined
  the squire impatiently, &ldquo;and the sight is not fit for women&rsquo;s
  eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, then she should be shown the clothes and effects.... And, if
  I mistake not, there&rsquo;s Richard Lambert, my late secretary, has he laid
  sworn information about the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe so,&rdquo; said Boatfield with some hesitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Boatfield, an you are so reluctant to do your duty in this matter,
  I&rsquo;ll speak to these people myself.... You are chief constable of the
  district ... indeed, &rsquo;tis you should do it ... and in the meanwhile
  I pray you, at least to give orders that the coffin be not nailed down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The kindly squire would have entered a further protest. He did not see the
  necessity of confronting an old woman with the gruesome sight of a mutilated
  corpse, nor did he perceive justifiable cause for further formalities of
  identification.</p>
  <p>But Sir Marmaduke having spoken very peremptorily, had already turned on
  his heel without waiting for his friend&rsquo;s protest, and was striding
  across the patch of rough stubble, which bordered the railing round the front
  of the cottage. Squire Boatfield reluctantly followed him. The next moment
  de Chavasse had lifted the latch of the gate, crossed the short flagged path
  and now knocked loudly against the front door.</p>
  <p>Apparently there was no desire for secrecy or rebellion on the part of the
  dwellers of the cottage, for hardly had Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s imperious knock
  echoed against the timbered walls, than the door was opened from within by
  Richard Lambert who, seeing the two gentlemen standing on the threshold,
  stepped back immediately, allowing them to pass.</p>
  <p>The old Quakeress and Richard were seemingly not alone. Two ladies sat in
  those same straight-backed chairs, wherein, some fifty hours ago Adam Lambert
  and the French prince had agreed upon that fateful meeting on the brow of
  the cliff.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s restless eyes took in at a glance every detail of
  that little parlor, which he had known so intimately. The low lintel of the
  door, which had always forced him to stoop as he entered, the central table
  with the pewter candlesticks upon it, the elm chairs shining like mirrors
  in response to the Quakeress&rsquo; maddening passion for cleanliness.</p>
  <p>Everything was just as it had been those few hours ago, when last he had
  picked up his broad-brimmed hat from the table and walked out of the cottage
  into the night. Everything was the same as it had been when his young girl-wife
  pushed a leather wallet across the table to him: the wallet which contained
  the fortune that he had not yet dared to turn fully to his own account.</p>
  <p>Aye! it was all just the same: for even at this moment as he stood there
  in the room, Sue, pale and still, faced him from across the table. For a
  moment he was silent, nor did anybody speak. Squire Boatfield felt unaccountably
  embarrassed, certain that he was intruding, vaguely wondering why the atmosphere
  in the cottage was so heavy and oppressive.</p>
  <p>Behind him, Richard Lambert had quietly closed the front door; the old woman
  stood in the background; the dusting-cloth which she had been plying so vigorously
  had dropped out of her hand when the two gentlemen had appeared in her little
  parlor so unexpectedly.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke was the first to break the silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear Sue,&rdquo; he said curtly, &ldquo;this is a strange place
  indeed wherein to find your ladyship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He cast a sharp, inquiring glance at her, then at his sister-in-law, who
  was still sitting by the hearth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She insisted on coming,&rdquo; said Mistress de Chavasse with a shrug
  of the shoulders, &ldquo;and I had not the power to stop her; I thought it
  best, therefore, to accompany her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was wearing the cloak and hood which Sir Marmaduke had seen round her
  shoulders when awhile ago he had met her in the hall of the Court. Apparently
  she had started out with Sue in his immediate wake, and now he had a distinct
  recollection that while the mare was slowly ambling along, he had looked
  back once or twice and seen two dark figures walking some fifty yards behind
  him on the road which he himself had just traversed.</p>
  <p>At the moment he had imagined that they were some village folk, wending
  their way towards Acol: now he was conscious of nerve-racking irritation
  at the thought that if he had only turned the mare&rsquo;s head back toward
  the Court&mdash;as he had at one time intended to do&mdash;he could have
  averted this present meeting&mdash;it almost seemed like a confrontation&mdash;here,
  in this cottage on the self-same spot, where thought of murder had first
  struck upon his brain.</p>
  <p>There was something inexplicable, strangely puzzling now in Sue&rsquo;s
  attitude.</p>
  <p>When de Chavasse had entered, she had risen from her chair and, as if deliberately,
  had walked over to the spot where she had stood during that momentous interview,
  when she relinquished her fortune entirely and without protest, into the
  hands of the man whom she had married, and whom she believed to be her lord.</p>
  <p>Her gaze now&mdash;calm and fixed, and withal vaguely searching&mdash;rested
  on her guardian&rsquo;s face. The fixity of her look increased his nerve-tension.
  The others, too, were regarding him with varying feelings which were freely
  expressed in their eyes. Boatfield seemed upset and somewhat resentful, the
  old woman sullen, despite the deference in her attitude, Lambert defiant,
  wrathful, nay! full of an incipient desire to avenge past wrongs.</p>
  <p>And dominating all, there was Editha&rsquo;s look of bewilderment, of puzzledom
  in her face at a mystery whereat her senses were beginning to reel, that
  mute questioning of the eyes, which speaks of turbulent thoughts within.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke uttered an exclamation of impatience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must return to the Court and at once,&rdquo; he said, avoiding
  Sue&rsquo;s gaze and speaking directly to Editha, &ldquo;the men are outside,
  with lanterns. You&rsquo;ll have to walk quickly an you wish to reach home
  before twilight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But even while he spoke, Sue&mdash;not heeding him&mdash;had turned to Squire
  Boatfield. She went up to him, holding out her hands as if in instinctive
  childlike appeal for protection, to a kindly man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This mystery is horrible!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>Boatfield took her small hands in his, patting them gently the while, desiring
  to soothe and comfort her, for she seemed deeply agitated and there was a
  wild look of fear from time to time in her pale face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir Marmaduke is right,&rdquo; said the squire gently, &ldquo;this
  is indeed no place for your ladyship. I did not see you arrive or I had at
  once persuaded you to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>De Chavasse would again have interposed. He stooped and picked up Sue&rsquo;s
  cloak which had fallen to the ground, and as he went up to her with the obvious
  intention of replacing it around her shoulders, she checked him, with a slight
  motion of her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I only heard of this terrible crime an hour ago,&rdquo; she said,
  speaking once more to Boatfield, &ldquo;and as I methinks, am the only person
  in the world who can throw light upon this awesome mystery, I thought it
  my duty to come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of a truth &rsquo;twas brave of your ladyship,&rdquo; quoth the squire,
  feeling a little bewildered at this strange announcement, &ldquo;but surely
  ... you did not know this man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If the rumor which hath reached me be correct,&rdquo; she replied
  quietly, &ldquo;then indeed did I know the murdered man intimately. Prince
  Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans was my husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter37"></a>Chapter 37<br>
  The Old Woman</b></h2>
  <p>There was silence in the tiny cottage parlor as the young girl made this
  extraordinary announcement in a firm if toneless voice, without flinching
  and meeting with a sort of stubborn pride the five pairs of eyes which were
  now riveted upon her.</p>
  <p>From outside came the hum of many voices, dull and subdued, like the buzzing
  of a swarm of bees, and against the small window panes the incessant patter
  of icy rain driven and lashed by the gale. Anon the wind moaned in the wide
  chimney, ... it seemed like the loud sigh of the Fates, satisfied at the
  tangle wrought by their relentless fingers in the threads of all these lives.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke, after a slight pause, had contrived to utter an oath&mdash;indicative
  of the wrath he, as Lady Sue&rsquo;s guardian, should have felt at her statement.
  Squire Boatfield frowned at the oath. He had never liked de Chavasse and
  disapproved more than ever of the man&rsquo;s attitude towards his womenkind
  now.</p>
  <p>The girl was in obvious, terrible distress: what she was feeling at this
  moment when she was taking those around her into her confidence could be
  as nothing compared to what she must have endured when she first heard the
  news that her strange bridegroom had been murdered.</p>
  <p>The kindly squire, though admitting the guardian&rsquo;s wrath, thought
  that its violent expression was certainly ill-timed. He allowed Sue to recover
  herself, for the more calm was her attitude outwardly, the more terrible
  must be the effort which she was making at self-control.</p>
  <p>Sue&rsquo;s eyes were fixed steadily upon her guardian, and Richard Lambert&rsquo;s
  upon her. Both these young people who had carved their own Fate in the very
  rock which now had shattered their lives, seemed to be searching for something
  vague, unavowed and mysterious which instinct told them was there, but which
  was so elusive, so intangible that the soul of each recoiled, even whilst
  it tried to probe.</p>
  <p>Entirely against her will Sue&mdash;whilst she looked on her guardian&mdash;could
  think of nothing save of that day in Dover, the lonely church, the gloomy
  vestry, and that weird patter of the rain against the window panes.</p>
  <p>She was not ashamed of what she had done, only of what she had felt for
  him, whom she now believed to be dead; that she gave him her fortune was
  nothing, she neither regretted nor cared about that. What, in the mind of
  a young and romantic girl, was the value of a fortune squandered, when that
  priceless treasure&mdash;her first love&mdash;had already been thrown away?
  But now she would no longer judge the dead. The money which he had filched
  from her, Fate and a murderous hand had quickly taken back from him, crushing
  beneath those chalk boulders his many desires, his vast ambitions, a worthless
  life and incomparable greed.</p>
  <p>Her love, which he had stolen ... that he could not give back: not that
  ardent, whole-souled, enthusiastic love; not the romantic idealism, the hero-worship,
  that veil of fantasy behind which first love is wont to hide its ephemerality.
  But she would not now judge the dead. Her romantic love lay buried in the
  lonely church at Dover, and she was striving not to think even of its grave.</p>
  <p>Squire Boatfield&rsquo;s kindly voice recalled her to her immediate surroundings
  and to the duty&mdash;self-imposed&mdash;which had brought her thither.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; he said, speaking with unwonted solemnity, &ldquo;if
  what you have just stated be, alas! the truth, then indeed, you and you only
  can throw some light on the terrible mystery which has been puzzling us all
  ... you may be the means which God hath chosen for bringing an evildoer to
  justice.... Will you, therefore, try ... though it may be very painful to
  you ... will you try and tell us everything that is in your mind ... everything
  which may draw the finger of God and our poor eyes to the miscreant who hath
  committed such an awful crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I fear me I have not much to tell,&rdquo; replied Sue simply, &ldquo;but
  I feel that it is my duty to suggest to the two magistrates here present
  what I think was the motive which prompted this horrible crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can suggest a motive for the crime?&rdquo; interposed Sir Marmaduke,
  striving to sneer, although his voice sounded quite toneless, for his throat
  was parched and his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, &ldquo;by Gad! &rsquo;twere
  vastly interesting to hear your ladyship&rsquo;s views.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He tried to speak flippantly, at which Squire Boatfield frowned deprecation.
  Lambert, without a word, had brought a chair near to Lady Sue, and with a
  certain gentle authority, he forced her to sit down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a crime, of that I feel sure,&rdquo; said Sue, &ldquo;nathless,
  that can be easily proven ... when ... when it has been discovered whether
  money and securities contained in a wallet of leather have been found among
  Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute;&rsquo;s effects.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Money and securities?&rdquo; ejaculated Sir Marmaduke with a loud
  oath, which he contrived to bring forth with the violence of genuine wrath, &ldquo;Money
  and securities? ... Forsooth, I trust ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My money and my securities, sir,&rdquo; she interposed with obvious
  hauteur, &ldquo;which I had last night and in this self-same room placed
  in the hands of Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans, my husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She said this with conscious pride. Whatever change her feelings may have
  undergone towards the man who had at one time been the embodiment of her
  most cherished dreams, she would not let her sneering guardian see that she
  had repented of her choice.</p>
  <p>Death had endowed her exiled prince with a dignity which had never been
  his in life, and the veil of tragedy which now lay over the mysterious stranger
  and his still more mysterious life, had called forth to its uttermost the
  young wife&rsquo;s sense of loyalty to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not your entire fortune, my dear, dear child, I hope ...&rdquo; ejaculated
  Squire Boatfield, more horror-struck this time than he had been when first
  he had heard of the terrible murder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The wallet contained my entire fortune,&rdquo; rejoined Sue calmly, &ldquo;all
  that Master Skyffington had placed in my hands on the day that my father
  willed that it should be given me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such folly is nothing short of criminal,&rdquo; said Sir Marmaduke
  roughly, &ldquo;nathless, had not the gentleman been murdered that night
  he would have shown Thanet and you a clean pair of heels, taking your money
  with him, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! aye! but he was murdered,&rdquo; said Squire Boatfield firmly, &ldquo;the
  question only is by whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some footpad who haunts the cliffs,&rdquo; rejoined de Chavasse lightly, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
  simple enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simple, mayhap ...&rdquo; mused the squire, &ldquo;yet ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused a moment and once more silence fell on all those assembled in
  the small cottage parlor. Sir Marmaduke felt as if every vein in his body
  was gradually being turned to stone.</p>
  <p>The sense of expectancy was so overwhelming that it completely paralyzed
  every other faculty within him, and Editha&rsquo;s searching eyes seemed
  like a corroding acid touching an aching wound. Yet for the moment there
  was no danger. He had so surrounded himself and his crimes with mystery that
  it would take more than a country squire&rsquo;s slowly moving brain to draw
  aside that weird and ghostlike curtain which hid his evil deeds.</p>
  <p>No! there was no danger&mdash;as yet!</p>
  <p>But he cursed himself for a fool and a coward, not to have gone away&mdash;abroad&mdash;long
  ere such a possible confrontation threatened him. He cursed himself for being
  here at all&mdash;and above all for having left the smith&rsquo;s clothes
  and the leather wallet in that lonely pavilion in the park.</p>
  <p>Squire Boatfield&rsquo;s kind eyes now rested on the old woman, who, awed
  and silent&mdash;shut out by her infirmities from this strange drama which
  was being enacted in her cottage&mdash;had stood calm and impassive by, trying
  to read with that wonderful quickness of intuition which the poverty of one
  sense gives to the others&mdash;what was going on round her, since she could
  not hear.</p>
  <p>Her eyes&mdash;pale and dim, heavy-lidded and deeply-lined&mdash;rested
  often on the face of Richard Lambert, who, leaning against the corner of
  the hearth, had watched the proceedings silently and intently. When the Quakeress&rsquo;s
  faded gaze met that of the young man, there was a quick and anxious look
  which passed from her to him: a look of entreaty for comfort, one of fear
  and of growing horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so the exiled prince lodged in your cottage, mistress?&rdquo; said
  Squire Boatfield, after a while, turning to Mistress Lambert.</p>
  <p>The old woman&rsquo;s eyes wandered from Richard to the squire. The look
  of fear in them vanished, giving place to good-natured placidity. She shuffled
  forward, in the manner which had so oft irritated her lodger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh? ... what?&rdquo; she queried, approaching the squire, &ldquo;I
  am somewhat hard of hearing these times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We were speaking of your lodger, mistress,&rdquo; rejoined Boatfield,
  raising his voice, &ldquo;harm hath come to him, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! aye!&rdquo; she replied blandly, &ldquo;harm hath come to our
  lodger.... Nay! the Lord hath willed it so.... The stranger was queer in
  his ways.... I don&rsquo;t wonder that harm hath come to him....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You remember him well, mistress?&mdash;him and the clothes he used
  to wear?&rdquo; asked Squire Boatfield.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! I remember the clothes,&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;I saw
  them again on the dead who now lieth in Adam&rsquo;s forge ... the same curious
  clothes of a truth ... clothes the Lord would condemn as wantonness and vanity....
  I saw them again on the dead man,&rdquo; she reiterated garrulously, &ldquo;the
  frills and furbelows ... things the Lord hateth ... and which no Christian
  should place upon his person ... yet the foreigner wore them ... he had none
  other ... and went out with them on him that night that the Lord sent him
  down into perdition....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you see him go out that night, mistress?&rdquo; asked the squire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh? ... what? ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did he go out alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The dimmed eyes of the old woman roamed restlessly from face to face. It
  seemed as if that look of horror and of fear once more struggled to appear
  within the pale orbs. Yet the squire looked on her with kindness, and Lady
  Sue&rsquo;s tear-veiled eyes expressed boundless sympathy. Richard, on the
  other hand, did not look at her, his gaze was riveted on Sir Marmaduke de
  Chavasse with an intensity which caused the latter to meet that look, trying
  to defy it, and then to flinch before its expression of passionate wrath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We wish to know where your nephew Adam is, mistress,&rdquo; now broke
  in de Chavasse roughly, &ldquo;the squire and I would wish to ask him a few
  questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as the Quakeress did not reply, he added almost savagely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you answer, woman? Are ye still hard of hearing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your pardon, Sir Marmaduke,&rdquo; interposed Lambert firmly, &ldquo;my
  aunt is old and feeble. She hath been much upset and over anxious ... seeing
  that my brother Adam is still from home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke broke into a loud and prolonged laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha! good master ... so I understand ... your brother is from
  home ... whilst the wallet containing her ladyship&rsquo;s fortune has disappeared
  along with him, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are they saying, lad?&rdquo; queried the old woman in her trembling
  voice, &ldquo;what are they saying? I am fearful lest there&rsquo;s something
  wrong with Adam....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, dear ... there&rsquo;s naught amiss,&rdquo; said Lambert
  soothingly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s naught amiss....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instinctively now Sue had risen. Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s cruel laugh had grated
  horribly on her ear, rousing an echo in her memory which she could not understand
  but which caused her to encircle the trembling figure of the old Quakeress
  with young, protecting arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are Squire Boatfield and I to understand, Lambert,&rdquo; continued
  Sir Marmaduke, speaking to the young man, &ldquo;that your brother Adam has
  unaccountably disappeared since the night on which the foreigner met with
  his tragic fate? Nay, Boatfield,&rdquo; he added, turning to the squire,
  as Lambert had remained silent, &ldquo;methinks you, as chief magistrate,
  should see your duty clearly. &rsquo;Tis a warrant you should sign and quickly,
  too, ere a scoundrel slip through the noose of justice. I can on the morrow
  to Dover, there to see the chief constable, but Pyot and his men should not
  be idle the while.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is he saying, my dear?&rdquo; murmured Mistress Lambert, timorously,
  as she clung with pathetic fervor to the young girl beside her, &ldquo;what
  is the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is your nephew Adam?&rdquo; said de Chavasse roughly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she retorted with amazing strength of voice,
  as she gently but firmly disengaged herself from the restraining arms that
  would have kept her back. &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;what
  is it to thee, where he is? Art accusing him perchance of doing away with
  that foreign devil?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice rose shrill and resonant, echoing in the low-ceilinged room; her
  pale eyes, dimmed with many tears, with hard work, and harder piety were
  fixed upon the man who had dared to accuse her lad.</p>
  <p>He tried not to flinch before that gaze, to keep up the air of mockery,
  the sound of a sneer. Outside the murmur of voices had become somewhat louder,
  the shuffling of bare feet on the flag-stones could now be distinctly heard.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter38"></a>Chapter 38<br>
  The Voice Of The Dead</b></h2>
  <p>The next moment a timid knock against the front door caused everyone to
  start. A strange eerie feeling descended on the hearts of all, of innocent
  and of guilty, of accuser and of defender. The knock seemed to have come
  from spectral hands, for &rsquo;twas followed by no further sound.</p>
  <p>Then again the knock.</p>
  <p>Lambert went to the door and opened it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be the quality here?&rdquo; queried a timid voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Squire Boatfield is here and Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse,&rdquo; replied
  Lambert, &ldquo;what is it, Mat? Come in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The squire had risen at sound of his name, and now went to the door, glad
  enough to shake himself free from that awful oppression which hung on the
  cottage like a weight of evil.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Mat?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>A man in rough shirt and coarse breeches and with high boots reaching up
  to the thigh was standing humbly in the doorway. He was bareheaded and his
  lanky hair, wet with rain and glittering with icy moisture, was blown about
  by the gale. At sight of the squire he touched his forelock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The hour is getting late, squire,&rdquo; he said hesitatingly, &ldquo;we
  carriers be ready.... &rsquo;Tis an hour or more down to Minster ... walking
  with a heavy burden I mean.... If your Honor would give the order, mayhap
  we might nail down the coffin lid now and make a start.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marmaduke de Chavasse, too, had turned towards the doorway. Both men looked
  out on the little crowd which had congregated beyond the little gate. It
  was long past three o&rsquo;clock now, and the heavy snow clouds overhead
  obscured the scanty winter light, and precipitated the approach of evening.
  In the gray twilight, a group of men could be seen standing somewhat apart
  from the others. All were bareheaded, and all wore rough shirts and breeches
  of coarse worsted, drab or brown in color, toning in with the dull monochrome
  of the background.</p>
  <p>Between them in the muddy road stood the long deal coffin. The sheet which
  covered it, rendered heavy with persistent wet, flapped dismally against
  the wooden sides of the box. Overhead a group of rooks were circling whilst
  uttering their monotonous call.</p>
  <p>A few women had joined their men-folk, attracted by the novelty of the proceedings,
  yielding their momentary comfort to their feeling of curiosity. They had
  drawn their kirtles over their heads and looked like gigantic oval balls,
  gray or black, with small mud-stained feet peeping out below.</p>
  <p>Sue had thrown an appealing look at Squire Boatfield, when she saw that
  dismal cort&egrave;ge. Her husband, her prince! the descendant of the Bourbons,
  the regenerator of France lying there&mdash;unrecognizable, horrible and
  loathsome&mdash;in a rough wooden coffin hastily nailed together by a village
  carpenter.</p>
  <p>She did not wish to look on him: and with mute eyes begged the squire to
  spare her and to spare the old woman, who, through the doorway had caught
  sight of the drabby little crowd, and of the deal box on the ground.</p>
  <p>Lambert, too, at sight of the cort&egrave;ge had gone to the Quakeress,
  the kind soul who had cared for him and his brother, two nameless lads, without
  home save the one she had provided for them. He trusted in Squire Boatfield&rsquo;s
  sense of humanity not to force this septuagenarian to an effort of nerve
  and will altogether beyond her powers.</p>
  <p>Together the two young people were using gentle persuasion to get the old
  woman to the back room, whence she could not see the dreary scene now or
  presently, the slow winding of the dismal little procession down the road
  which leads to Minster, and whence she could not hear that weird flapping
  of the wet sheet against the side of the coffin, an echo to the slow and
  muffled tolling of the church bell some little distance away.</p>
  <p>But the old woman was obstinate. She struggled against the persuasion of
  young arms. Things had been said in her cottage just now, which she must
  hear more distinctly: vague accusations had been framed, a cruel and sneering
  laugh had echoed through the house from whence one of her lads&mdash;Adam&mdash;was
  absent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; she said with quiet firmness, as Lambert urged her
  to withdraw, &ldquo;let be, lad ... let be ... ye cannot deceive the old
  woman all of ye.... The Lord hath put wool in my ears, so I cannot hear ...
  but my eyes are good.... I can see your faces.... I can read them.... Speak
  man!&rdquo; she said, as she suddenly disengaged herself from Richard&rsquo;s
  restraining arms and walked deliberately up to Marmaduke de Chavasse, &ldquo;speak
  man.... Didst thou accuse Adam?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An involuntary &ldquo;No!&rdquo; escaped from the squire&rsquo;s kindly
  heart and lips. But Sir Marmaduke shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>The crisis which by his own acts, by his own cowardice, he himself had precipitated,
  was here now. Fatality had overtaken him. Whether the whole truth would come
  to light he did not know. Truly at this moment he hardly cared. He did not
  feel as if he were himself, but another being before whom stood another Sir
  Marmaduke de Chavasse, on whom he&mdash;a specter, a ghoul, a dream figure&mdash;was
  about to pass judgment.</p>
  <p>He knew that he need do nothing now, for without his help or any effort
  on his part, that morbid curiosity which had racked his brain for two days
  would be fully satisfied. He would know absolutely now, exactly what everyone
  thought of the mysterious French prince and of his terrible fate on Epple
  sands.</p>
  <p>Thank Satan and all his hordes of devils that heavy chalk boulders had done
  so complete a work of obliteration.</p>
  <p>But whilst he looked down with complete indifference on the old woman, she
  looked about from one face to the other, trying to read what cruel thoughts
  of Adam lurked behind those obvious expressions of sympathy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So that foreign devil hath done mischief at last,&rdquo; she now
  said loudly, her tremulous voice gaining in strength as she spoke, &ldquo;the
  Lord would not allow him to do it living ... so the devil hath helped him
  to it now that he is dead.... But I tell you that Adam is innocent.... There
  was no harm in the lad ... a little rough at times ... but no harm ... he&rsquo;d
  no father to bring him up ... and his mother was a wanton ... so there was
  only the foolish old woman to look after the boys ... but there&rsquo;s no
  harm in the lad ... there&rsquo;s no harm!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice broke down now in a sob, her throat seemed choked, but with an
  effort which seemed indeed amazing in one of her years, she controlled her
  tears, and for a moment was silent. The gray twilight crept in through the
  door of the cottage, where Mat, bareheaded and humble, still waited for the
  order to go.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke would have interrupted the old woman&rsquo;s talk ere this,
  but his limbs were now completely paralyzed: he might have been made of stone,
  so rigid did he feel himself to be: a marble image, or else a specter, a
  shadow-figure that existed yet could not move.</p>
  <p>There was such passionate earnestness in the old woman&rsquo;s words that
  everyone else remained dumb. Richard, whose heart was filled with dread,
  who had endured agonies of anxiety since the disappearance of his brother,
  had but one great desire, which was to spare to the kind soul a knowledge
  which would mean death or worse to her.</p>
  <p>As for Editha de Chavasse, she was a mere spectator still: so puzzled, so
  bewildered that she was quite convinced at this moment, that she must be
  mad. She could not encounter Marmaduke&rsquo;s eyes, try how she might. The
  look in his face horrified her less than it mystified her. She alone&mdash;save
  the murderer himself&mdash;knew that the man who lay in that deal coffin
  out there was not the mysterious foreigner who had never existed.</p>
  <p>But if not the stranger, then who was it, who was dead? and what had Adam
  Lambert to do with the whole terrible deed?</p>
  <p>Sue once more tried to lead Mistress Lambert gently away, but she pushed
  the young girl aside quite firmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t believe me?&rdquo; she asked, looking from one face
  to the other, &ldquo;ye don&rsquo;t believe me, yet I tell ye all that Adam
  is innocent ... and that the Lord will not allow the innocent to be unjustly
  condemned.... Aye! He will e&rsquo;en let the dead arise, I say, and proclaim
  the innocence of my lad!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her eyes&mdash;with dilated pupils and pale opaque rims&mdash;had the look
  of the seer in them now; she gazed straight out before her into the rain-laden
  air, and it seemed almost as if in it she could perceive visions of avenging
  swords, of defending angels and accusing ghouls, that she could hear whisperings
  of muffled voices and feel beckoning hands guiding her to a world peopled
  by specters and evil beings that prey upon the dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me pass!&rdquo; she said with amazing vigor, as Squire Boatfield,
  with kindly concern, tried to bar her exit through the door, &ldquo;let me
  pass I say! the dead and I have questions to ask of one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is madness!&rdquo; broke in Marmaduke de Chavasse with an effort; &ldquo;that
  body is not a fit sight for a woman to look upon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He would have seized the Quakeress by the arm in order to force her back,
  but Richard Lambert already stood between her and him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let no one dare to lay a hand on her,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
  <p>And the old woman escaping from all those who would have restrained her,
  walked rapidly through the doorway and down the flagged path rendered slippery
  with the sleet. The gale caught the white wings of her coif, causing them
  to flutter about her ears, and freezing strands of her gray locks which stood
  out now all round her head like a grizzled halo.</p>
  <p>She could scarcely advance, for the wind drove her kirtle about her lean
  thighs, and her feet with the heavy tan shoes sank ankle deep in the puddles
  formed by the water in the interstices of the flagstones. The rain beat against
  her face, mingling with the tears which now flowed freely down her cheeks.
  But she did not heed the discomfort nor yet the cold, and she would not be
  restrained.</p>
  <p>The next moment she stood beside the rough wooden coffin and with a steady
  hand had lifted the wet sheet, which continued to flap with dull, mournful
  sound round the feet of the dead.</p>
  <p>The Quakeress looked down upon the figure stretched out here in death&mdash;neither
  majestic nor peaceful, but horrible and weirdly mysterious. She did not flinch
  at the sight. Resentment against the foreigner dimmed her sense of horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So my fine prince,&rdquo; she said, whilst awed at the spectacle
  of this old woman parleying with the dead, carriers and mourners had instinctively
  moved a few steps away from her, &ldquo;so thou wouldst harm my boy! ...
  Thou always didst hate him ... thou with thy grand airs, and thy rough ways....
  Had the Lord allowed it, this hand of thine would ere now have been raised
  against him ... as it oft was raised against the old woman ... whose infirmities
  should have rendered her sacred in thy sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stooped, and deliberately raised the murdered man&rsquo;s hand in hers,
  and for one moment fixed her gaze upon it. For that one moment she was silent,
  looking down at the rough fingers, the coarse nails, the blistered palm.</p>
  <p>Then still holding the hand in hers, she looked up, then round at every
  face which was turned fixedly upon her. Thus she encountered the eyes of
  the men and women, present here only to witness an unwonted spectacle, then
  those of the kindly squire, of Lady Sue, of Mistress de Chavasse, and of
  her other lad&mdash;Richard&mdash;all of whom had instinctively followed
  her down the short flagged path in the wake of her strange and prophetic
  pilgrimage.</p>
  <p>Lastly her eyes met those of Marmaduke de Chavasse. Then she spoke slowly
  in a low muffled voice, which gradually grew more loud and more full of passionate
  strength.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! the Lord is just,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the Lord is great!
  It is the dead which shall rise again and proclaim the innocence of the just,
  and the guilt of the wicked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused a while, and stooped to kiss the marble-like hand which she held
  tightly grasped in hers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Adam!&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;Adam, my boy! ... my lad! ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The men and women looked on, stupidly staring, not understanding yet, what
  new tragedy had suddenly taken the place of the old.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aunt, aunt dear,&rdquo; whispered Lambert, who had pushed his way
  forward, and now put his arm round the old woman, for she had begun to sway, &ldquo;what
  is the matter, dear?&rdquo; he repeated anxiously, &ldquo;what does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And conquering his own sense of horror and repulsion, he tried to disengage
  the cold and rigid hand of the dead from the trembling grasp of the Quakeress.
  But she would not relinquish her hold, only she turned and looked steadily
  at the young lad, whilst her voice rose firm and harsh above the loud patter
  of the rain and the moaning of the wind through the distant; trees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It means, my lad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it means all of you ...
  that what I said was true ... that Adam is innocent of crime ... for he lies
  here dead ... and the Lord will see that his death shall not remain unavenged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more she kissed the rough hand, beautiful now with that cold beauty
  which the rigidity of death imparts; then she replaced it reverently, silently,
  and fell upon her knees in the wet mud, beside the coffin.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter39"></a>Chapter 39<br>
  The Home-Coming Of Adam Lambert</b></h2>
  <p>All heads were bent; none of the ignorant folk who stood around would have
  dared even to look at the old woman kneeling beside that rough deal box which
  contained the body of her lad. A reverent feeling had killed all curiosity:
  bewilderment at the extraordinary and wholly unexpected turn of events had
  been merged in a sense of respectful awe, which rendered every mouth silent,
  and lowered every lid.</p>
  <p>Squire Boatfield, almost paralyzed with astonishment, had murmured half
  stupidly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Adam Lambert ... dead? ... I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned to Marmaduke de Chavasse as if vaguely, instinctively expecting
  an answer to the terrible puzzle from him.</p>
  <p>De Chavasse&rsquo;s feet, over which he himself seemed to have no control,
  had of a truth led him forward, so that he, too, stood not far from the old
  woman now. He had watched her&mdash;silent and rigid,&mdash;conscious only
  of one thing&mdash;a trivial matter certes&mdash;of Editha&rsquo;s inquiring
  eyes fixed steadily upon him.</p>
  <p>Everything else had been merged in a kind of a dream. But the mute question
  in those eyes was what concerned him. It seemed to represent the satisfaction
  of that morbid curiosity which had been such a terrible obsession during
  these past nerve-racking days.</p>
  <p>Editha, realizing the identity of the dead man, would there and then know
  the entire truth. But Editha&rsquo;s fate was too closely linked to his own
  to render her knowledge of that truth dangerous to de Chavasse: therefore,
  with him it was merely a sense of profound satisfaction that someone would
  henceforth share his secret with him.</p>
  <p>It is quite impossible to analyze the thoughts of the man who thus stood
  by&mdash;a silent and almost impassive spectator&mdash;of a scene, wherein
  his fate, his life, an awful retribution and deadly justice, were all hanging
  in the balance. He was not mad, nor did he act with either irrelevance or
  rashness. The sense of self-protection was still keen in him ... violently
  keen ... although undoubtedly he, and he alone, was responsible for the events
  which culminated in the present crisis.</p>
  <p>The whole aspect of affairs had changed from the moment that the real identity
  of the dead had been established. Everyone here present would regard this
  new mystery in an altogether different light to that by which they had viewed
  the former weird problem; but still there need be no danger to the murderer.</p>
  <p>Editha would know, of course, but no one else, and it would be vastly curious
  anon to see what lady Sue would do.</p>
  <p>Therefore, Sir Marmaduke was chiefly conscious of Editha&rsquo;s presence,
  and then only of Sue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some old woman&rsquo;s folly,&rdquo; he now said roughly, in response
  to Squire Boatfield&rsquo;s mute inquiry, &ldquo;awhile ago she identified
  the clothes as having belonged to the foreign prince.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, the clothes, de Chavasse,&rdquo; murmured the squire meditatively, &ldquo;the
  clothes, but not the man ... and &rsquo;twas you yourself who just now....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Master Lambert should know his own brother,&rdquo; here came in a
  suppressed murmur from one or two of the men, who respectful before the quality,
  had now become too excited to keep altogether silent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I know my brother,&rdquo; retorted Richard Lambert boldly, &ldquo;and
  can but curse mine own cowardice in not defending him ere this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What more lies are we to hear?&rdquo; sneered de Chavasse, &ldquo;surely,
  Boatfield, this stupid scene hath lasted long enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put my knowledge to the test, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Lambert. &ldquo;My
  brother&rsquo;s arm was scarred by a deep cut from shoulder to elbow, caused
  by the fall of a sharp-bladed ax&mdash;&rsquo;twas the right arm ... will
  you see, Sir Marmaduke, or will you allow me to lay bare the right arm of
  this man ... to see if I had lied? ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Squire Boatfield, conquering his reluctance, had approached nearer to the
  coffin; he, too, lifted the dead man&rsquo;s arm, as the old woman had done
  just now, and he gazed down meditatively at the hand, which though shapely,
  was obviously rough and toil-worn. Then, with a firm and deliberate gesture,
  he undid the sleeve of the doublet and pushed it back, baring the arm up
  to the shoulder.</p>
  <p>He looked at the lifeless flesh for a moment, there where a deep and long
  scar stood out plainly between the elbow and shoulder like the veining in
  a block of marble. Then he pulled the sleeve down again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither you, nor Mistress Lambert have lied, master,&rdquo; he said
  simply. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Adam Lambert who lies here ... murdered ... and
  if that be so,&rdquo; he continued firmly, &ldquo;then the man who put these
  clothes upon the body of the smith is his murderer ... the foreigner who
  called himself Prince Am&eacute;d&eacute; d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The husband of Lady Sue Aldmarshe,&rdquo; quoth Sir Marmaduke, breaking
  into a loud laugh.</p>
  <p>The rain had momentarily ceased, although the gale, promising further havoc,
  still continued that mournful swaying of the dead branches of the trees.
  But a gentle drip-drip had replaced that incessant patter. The humid atmosphere
  had long ago penetrated through rough shirts and worsted breeches, causing
  the spectators of this weird tragedy to shiver with the cold.</p>
  <p>The shades of evening had begun to gather in. It were useless now to attempt
  to reach Minster before nightfall: nor presumably would the old Quakeress
  thus have parted from the dead body of her lad.</p>
  <p>Richard Lambert had begged that the coffin might be taken into the cottage.
  The old woman&rsquo;s co-religionists would help her to obtain for Adam fitting
  and Christian burial.</p>
  <p>After Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s sneering taunt no one had spoken. For these
  yokels and their womenfolk the matter had passed altogether beyond their
  ken. Bewildered, not understanding, above all more than half fearful, they
  consulted one another vaguely and mutely with eyes and quaint expressive
  gestures, wondering what had best be done.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas fortunate that the rain had ceased. One by one the women, still
  holding their kirtles tightly round their shoulders, began to move away.
  The deal box seemed to have reached a degree of mystery from which &rsquo;twas
  best to keep at a distance. The men, too&mdash;those who had come as spectators&mdash;were
  gradually edging away; some walked off with their womenfolk, others hung
  back in groups of three or four discussing the most hospitable place to which &rsquo;twere
  best to adjourn.</p>
  <p>All wore a strangely shamed expression of timidity&mdash;almost of self-deprecation,
  as if apologetic for their presence here when the quality had matters of
  such grave import to discuss. No one had really understood Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s
  sneering taunt, only they felt instinctively that there were some secrets
  which it had been disrespectful even to attempt to guess.</p>
  <p>Those who had been prepared to carry the coffin to Minster were the last
  to hang back. Squire Boatfield was obviously giving some directions to their
  foreman, Mat, who tugged at his forelock at intervals, indicating that he
  was prepared to obey. The others stood aside waiting for instructions.</p>
  <p>Thus the deal box remained on the ground, exactly opposite the tiny wooden
  gate, strangely isolated and neglected-looking after the dispersal of the
  interested crowd which had surrounded it awhile ago. It seemed as if with
  the establishment of the real identity of the dead the intensity of the excitement
  had vanished. The mysterious foreigner had a small court round him; Adam
  Lambert, only his brother and the old Quakeress.</p>
  <p>They remained beside the coffin, she kneeling with her head buried in her
  wrinkled hands, he standing silent and passionately wrathful both against
  one man and against destiny. He had almost screamed with horror when de Chavasse
  thus brutally uttered Lady Sue&rsquo;s name: he had seen the young girl almost
  sway on her feet, as she smothered the cry of agony and horror which at her
  guardian&rsquo;s callous taunt had risen to her lips.</p>
  <p>He had seen and in his heart worshiped her for the heroic effort which she
  made to remain outwardly calm, not to betray before a crowd the agonizing
  horror, the awful fear and the burning shame which of a truth would have
  crushed most women of her tender years. And because he saw that she did not
  wish to betray one single thought or emotion, he did not approach, nor attempt
  to show the overwhelming sympathy which he felt.</p>
  <p>He knew that any word from him to her would only call forth more malicious
  sneers from that strange man, who seemed to be pursuing Lady Sue and also
  himself&mdash;Lambert&mdash;with a tenacious and incomprehensible hatred.</p>
  <p>Richard remained, therefore, beside his dead brother&rsquo;s coffin, supporting
  and anon gently raising the old woman from the ground.</p>
  <p>Mat&mdash;the foreman&mdash;had joined his comrades and after a word of
  explanation, they once more gathered round the wooden box. Stooping to their
  task, their sinews cracking under the effort, the perspiration streaming
  from their foreheads, they raised the mortal remains of Adam Lambert from
  the ground and hoisted the burden upon their shoulders.</p>
  <p>Then they turned into the tiny gate and slowly walked with it along the
  little flagged path to the cottage. The men had to stoop as they crossed
  the threshold, and the heavy box swayed above their powerful shoulders.</p>
  <p>The Quakeress and Richard followed, going within in the wake of the six
  men. The parlor was then empty, and thus it was that Adam Lambert finally
  came home.</p>
  <p>The others&mdash;Squire Boatfield and Mistress de Chavasse, Lady Sue and
  Sir Marmaduke&mdash;had stood aside in the small fore-court, to enable the
  small cort&egrave;ge to pass. Directly Richard Lambert and the old woman
  disappeared within the gloom of the cottage interior, these four people&mdash;each
  individually the prey of harrowing thoughts&mdash;once more turned their
  steps towards the open road.</p>
  <p>There was nothing more to be done here at this cottage, where the veil of
  mystery which had fallen over the gruesome murder had been so unexpectedly
  lifted by a septuagenarian&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter40"></a>Chapter 40<br>
  Editha&rsquo;s Return</b></h2>
  <p>Squire Boatfield was vastly perturbed. Never had his position as magistrate
  seemed so onerous to him, nor his duties as major-general quite so arduous.
  A vague and haunting fear had seized him, a fear that&mdash;if he did do
  his duty, if he did continue his investigations of the mysterious crime&mdash;he
  would learn something vastly horrible and awesome, something he had best
  never know.</p>
  <p>He tried to take indifferent leave of the ladies, yet he quite dreaded to
  meet Lady Sue&rsquo;s eyes. If all the misery, the terror which she must
  feel, were expressed in them, then indeed, would her young face be a heart-breaking
  sight for any man to see.</p>
  <p>He kissed the hand of Editha de Chavasse, and bowed in mute and deferential
  sympathy to the young girl-wife, who of a truth had this day quaffed at one
  draught the brimful cup of sorrow and of shame.</p>
  <p>An inexplicable instinct restrained him from taking de Chavasse&rsquo;s
  hand; he was quite glad indeed that the latter seemingly absorbed in thoughts
  was not heeding his going.</p>
  <p>The squire in his turn now passed out of the little gate. The evening was
  drawing in over-rapidly now, and it would be a long and dismal ride from
  here to Sarre.</p>
  <p>Fortunately he had two serving-men with him, each with a lantern. They were
  now standing beside their master&rsquo;s cob, some few yards down the road,
  which from this point leads in a straight course down to Sarre.</p>
  <p>Not far from the entrance to the forge, Boatfield saw petty-constable Pyot
  in close converse with Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy, butler to Sir Marmaduke.
  The man was talking with great volubility, and obvious excitement, and Pyot
  was apparently torn between his scorn for the narrator&rsquo;s garrulousness,
  and his fear of losing something of what the talker had to say.</p>
  <p>At sight of Boatfield, Pyot unceremoniously left Master Busy standing, open-mouthed,
  in the very midst of a voluble sentence, and approached the squire, doffing
  his cap respectfully as he did so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will your Honor sign a warrant?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A warrant? What warrant?&rdquo; queried the worthy squire, who of
  a truth, was falling from puzzlement to such absolute bewilderment that he
  felt literally as if his head would burst with the weight of so much mystery
  and with the knowledge of such dire infamy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think that the scoundrel is cleverer than we thought, your Honor,&rdquo; continued
  the petty constable, &ldquo;we must not allow him to escape.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am quite bewildered,&rdquo; murmured the squire. &ldquo;What is
  the warrant for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the apprehension of the man whom the folk about here called the
  Prince of Orl&eacute;ans. I can set the watches on the go this very night,
  nay! they shall scour the countryside to some purpose&mdash;the murderer
  cannot be very far, we know that he is dressed in the smith&rsquo;s clothes,
  we&rsquo;ll get him soon enough, but he may have friends....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Friends?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He may have been a real prince, your Honor,&rdquo; said Pyot with
  a laugh, which contradicted his own suggestion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! aye! ... Mayhap!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He may have powerful friends ... or such as would resist the watches
  ... resist us, mayhap ... a warrant would be useful....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! aye! you are right, constable,&rdquo; said Boatfield, still
  a little bewildered, &ldquo;do you come along to Sarre with me, I&rsquo;ll
  give you a warrant this very night. Have you a horse here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, your Honor,&rdquo; rejoined the man, &ldquo;an it please you,
  my going to Sarre would delay matters and the watches could not start their
  search this night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then what am I to do?&rdquo; exclaimed the squire, somewhat impatient
  of the whole thing now, longing to get away, and to forget, beside his own
  comfortable fireside, all the harrowing excitement of this unforgettable
  day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young Lambert is a bookworm, your Honor,&rdquo; suggested Pyot, who
  was keen on the business, seeing that his zeal, if accompanied by success,
  would surely mean promotion; &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be ink and paper in the
  cottage.... An your Honor would but write a few words and sign them, something
  I could show to a commanding officer, if perchance I needed the help of soldiery,
  or to the chief constable resident at Dover, for methinks some of us must
  push on that way ... your Honor must forgive ... we should be blamed&mdash;punished,
  mayhap&mdash;if we allowed such a scoundrel to remain unhung....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you will, man, as you will,&rdquo; sighed the worthy squire impatiently, &ldquo;but
  wait!&rdquo; he added, as Pyot, overjoyed, had already turned towards the
  cottage, &ldquo;wait until Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse and the ladies have
  gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He called his serving-men to him and ordered them to start on their way
  towards home, but to wait for him, with his cob, at the bend of the road,
  just in the rear of the little church.</p>
  <p>Some instinct, for which he could not rightly have accounted, roused in
  him the desire to keep his return to the cottage a secret from Sir Marmaduke.
  Attended by Pyot, he followed his men down the road, and the angle of the
  cottage soon hid him from view.</p>
  <p>De Chavasse in the meanwhile had ordered his own men to escort the ladies
  home. Busy and Toogood lighted their lanterns, whilst Sue and Editha, wrapping
  their cloaks and hoods closely round their heads and shoulders, prepared
  to follow them.</p>
  <p>Anon the little procession began slowly to wind its way back towards Acol
  Court.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke lingered behind for a while, of set purpose: he had no wish
  to walk beside either Editha or Lady Sue, so he took some time in mounting
  his nag, which had been tethered in the rear of the forge. His intention
  was to keep the men with the lanterns in sight, for&mdash;though there were
  no dangerous footpads in Thanet&mdash;yet Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s mood was
  not one that courted isolation on a dark and lonely road.</p>
  <p>Therefore, just before he saw the dim lights of the lanterns disappearing
  down the road, which at this point makes a sharp dip before rising abruptly
  once more on the outskirts of the wood, Sir Marmaduke finally put his foot
  in the stirrup and started to follow.</p>
  <p>The mare had scarce gone a few paces before he saw the figure of a woman
  detaching itself from the little group on ahead, and then turning and walking
  rapidly back towards the village. He could not immediately distinguish which
  of the two ladies it was, for the figure was totally hidden beneath the ample
  folds of cloak and hood, but soon as it approached, he perceived that it
  was Editha.</p>
  <p>He would have stopped her by barring the way, he even thought of dismounting,
  thinking mayhap that she had left something behind at the cottage, and cursing
  his men for allowing her to return alone, but quick as a flash of lightning
  she ran past him, dragging her hood closer over her face as she ran.</p>
  <p>He hesitated for a few seconds, wondering what it all meant: he even turned
  the mare&rsquo;s head round to see whither Editha was going. She had already
  reached the railing and gate in front of the cottage; the next moment she
  had lifted the latch, and Sir Marmaduke could see her blurred outline, through
  the rising mist, walking quickly along the flagged path, and then he heard
  her peremptory knock at the cottage door.</p>
  <p>He waited a while, musing, checking the mare, who longed to be getting home.
  He fully expected to see Editha return within the next minute or so, for&mdash;vaguely
  through the fast-gathering gloom&mdash;he had perceived that someone had
  opened the door from within, a thin ray of yellowish light falling on Editha&rsquo;s
  cloaked figure. Then she disappeared into the cottage.</p>
  <p>On ahead the swaying lights of the lanterns were rapidly becoming more and
  more indistinguishable in the distance. Apparently Editha&rsquo;s departure
  from out the little group had not been noticed by the others. The men were
  ahead, and Sue, mayhap, was too deeply absorbed in thought to pay much heed
  as to what was going on round her.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke still hesitated. Editha was not returning, and the cottage
  door was once more closed. Courtesy demanded that he should wait so as to
  escort her home.</p>
  <p>But the fact that she had gone back to the cottage, at risk of having to
  walk back all alone and along a dark and dreary road, bore a weird significance
  to this man&rsquo;s tortuous mind. Editha, troubled with a mass of vague
  fears and horrible conjectures, had, mayhap, desired to have them set at
  rest, or else to hear their final and terrible confirmation.</p>
  <p>In either case Marmaduke de Chavasse had no wish now for a slow amble homewards
  in company with the one being in the world who knew him for what he was.</p>
  <p>That thought and also the mad desire to get away at last, to cease with
  this fateful procrastination and to fly from this country with the golden
  booty, which he had gained at such awful risks, these caused him finally
  to turn the mare&rsquo;s head towards home, leaving Editha to follow as best
  she might, in the company of one of the serving-men whom he would send back
  to meet her.</p>
  <p>The mare was ready to go. He spurred her to a sharp trot. Then having joined
  the little group on ahead, he sent Master Courage Toogood back with his lantern,
  with orders to inquire at the cottage for Mistress de Chavasse and there
  to await her pleasure.</p>
  <p>He asked Lady Sue to mount behind him, but this she refused to do. So he
  put his nag back to foot space, and thus the much-diminished little party
  slowly walked back to Acol Court.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter41"></a>Chapter 41<br>
  Their Name</b></h2>
  <p>What had prompted Editha de Chavasse to return thus alone to the Quakeress&rsquo;s
  cottage, she herself could not exactly have told.</p>
  <p>It must have been a passionate and irresistible desire to heap certainty
  upon a tangle of horrible surmises.</p>
  <p>With Adam Lambert lying dead&mdash;obviously murdered&mdash;and in the clothes
  affected by de Chavasse when masquerading as the French hero, there could
  be only one conclusion. But this to Editha&mdash;who throughout had given
  a helping hand in the management of the monstrous comedy&mdash;was so awful
  a solution of the puzzle that she could not but recoil from it, and strive
  to deny it while she had one sane thought left in her madly whirling brain.</p>
  <p>But though she fought against the conclusion with all her might, she did
  not succeed in driving it from her thoughts: and through it all there was
  a vein of uncertainty, that slender thread of hope that after all she might
  be the prey of some awful delusion, which a word from someone who really
  knew would anon easily dissipate.</p>
  <p>Someone who really knew? Nay! that someone could only be Marmaduke, and
  of him she dared not ask questions.</p>
  <p>Mayhap that on the other hand the old woman and Richard Lambert knew more
  than they had cared to say. Sue was indeed deeply absorbed in thoughts, walking
  with head bent and eyes fixed on the ground like a somnambulist. Editha,
  moved by unreasoning instinct, determined to see the Quakeress again, also
  the man who now lay dead, hoping that from him mayhap she might glean the
  real solution of that mystery which sooner or later would undoubtedly drive
  her mad.</p>
  <p>Running rapidly past horse and rider, for she would not speak to Marmaduke,
  she reached the cottage soon enough.</p>
  <p>In response to her knock, Master Lambert opened the door to her.</p>
  <p>The dim light of a couple of tallow candles flickered weirdly in the draught.
  Editha looked around her in amazement, astonished that&mdash;like herself&mdash;Squire
  Boatfield had also evidently retraced his steps and was sitting now in one
  of the high-backed chairs beside the hearth, whilst the old Quakeress stood
  not far from him, her attitude indicative of obstinacy, even of defiance,
  in the face of a duty with which apparently the squire had been charging
  her.</p>
  <p>At sight of Mistress de Chavasse, Boatfield rose. A look of annoyance crossed
  his face, at thought that Editha&rsquo;s arrival had, mayhap, endangered
  the success of his present purpose. Ink and paper were on the table close
  to his elbow, and it was obvious that he had been questioning the old woman
  very closely on a subject which she apparently desired to keep secret from
  him.</p>
  <p>Mistress Lambert&rsquo;s attitude had also changed at sight of Editha, who
  stood for a moment undecided on the threshold ere she ventured within. The
  look of obstinacy died out of the wrinkled face; the eyes took on a strange
  expression of sullen wrath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enter, my fine lady, I pray thee, enter,&rdquo; said the Quakeress; &ldquo;art
  also a party to these cross-questionings? ... art anxious to probe the secrets
  which the old woman hath kept hidden within the walls of this cottage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She laughed, a low, chuckling laugh, mirthless and almost cruel, as she
  surveyed Editha&rsquo;s cloaked figure and then the lady&rsquo;s scared and
  anxious face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I crave your pardon, mistress,&rdquo; said Editha, feeling oddly
  timid before the strange personality of the Quakeress. &ldquo;I would of
  a truth desire to ask your help in ... in ... I would not intrude ... and
  I ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! nay! prithee enter, fair mistress,&rdquo; rejoined Mistress
  Lambert dryly. &ldquo;Strange, that I should hear thy words so plainly....
  Thy words seem to find echo in my brain ... raising memories which thou hast
  buried long ago.... Enter, I prithee, and sit thee down,&rdquo; she added,
  shuffling towards the chair; &ldquo;shut the door, Dick lad ... and ask this
  fair mistress to sit.... The squire is asking many questions ... mayhap that
  I&rsquo;ll answer them, now that she is here....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In obedience to the quaint peremptoriness of her manner, Richard had closed
  the outer door, and drawn the chair forward, asking Mistress de Chavasse
  to sit. Squire Boatfield, who was visibly embarrassed, was still standing
  and tried to murmur some excuse, being obviously anxious to curtail this
  interview and to postpone his further questionings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come some other time, mistress,&rdquo; he said with obvious
  nervousness. &ldquo;Mistress de Chavasse desires to speak with you, and I&rsquo;ll
  return later on in the evening ... when you are alone....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! nay, man! ...&rdquo; rejoined the Quakeress, &ldquo;prithee,
  sit again ... the evening is young yet ... and what I may tell thee now has
  something to do with this fine lady here. Wilt question me again? I would
  mayhap reply.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stood close to the table, one wrinkled hand resting upon it; the guttering
  candles cast strange, fantastic lights on her old face, surmounted with the
  winged coif, and weird shadows down one side of her face. Editha, awed and
  subdued, gazed on her with a kind of fear, even of horror.</p>
  <p>In a dark corner of the little room the straight outline of the long deal
  box could only faintly be perceived in the gloom. Richard Lambert, silent
  and oppressed, stood close beside it, his face in shadow, his eyes fixed
  with a sense of inexplicable premonition on the face of Editha de Chavasse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, wilt question me again, man?&rdquo; asked the old Quakeress,
  turning to the squire, &ldquo;the Lord hath willed that my ears be clear
  to-day. Wilt question me? ... I&rsquo;ll hear thee ... and I&rsquo;ll give
  answer to thy questions....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, mistress,&rdquo; replied the squire, pointing to the ink and
  the paper on the table, &ldquo;methought you would wish to see the murderer
  of your ... your nephew ... swing on the gallows for his crime.... I would
  sign this paper here ordering the murderer of the smith of Acol to be apprehended
  as soon as found ... and to be brought forthwith before the magistrate ...
  there to give an account of his doings.... I asked you then to give me the
  full Christian and surname of the man whom the neighborhood and I myself
  thought was your nephew ... and to my surprise, you seemed to hesitate and
  ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll hesitate no longer,&rdquo; she interposed firmly. &ldquo;Let
  the lad there ask me his dead brother&rsquo;s name and I&rsquo;ll tell him....
  I&rsquo;ll tell him ... if he asks ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Justice must be done against Adam&rsquo;s murderer, dear mistress,&rdquo; said
  Richard gently, for the old woman had paused and turned to him, evidently
  waiting for him to speak. &ldquo;My brother&rsquo;s real name, his parentage,
  might explain the motive which led an evildoer to commit such an appalling
  crime. Therefore, dear mistress, do I ask thee to tell us my brother&rsquo;s
  name, and mine own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well done, lad ... &rsquo;tis well done,&rdquo; she rejoined
  when Richard had ceased speaking, and silence had fallen for awhile on that
  tiny cottage parlor, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis well done,&rdquo; she reiterated. &ldquo;The
  secret hath weighed heavily upon my old shoulders these past few years, since
  thou and Adam were no longer children.... But I swore to thy grandmother
  who died in the Lord, that thou and Adam should never hear of thy mother&rsquo;s
  wantonness and shame.... I swore it on her death-bed and I have kept my oath
  ... but I am old now.... After this trouble, mine hour will surely come....
  I am prepared but I will not take thy secret, lad, with me into my grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shuffled across to the old oak dresser which occupied one wall of the
  little room. Two pairs of glowing eyes followed her every movement; those
  of Richard Lambert, who seemed to see a vision of his destiny faintly outlined&mdash;still
  blurred&mdash;but slowly unfolding itself in the tangled web of fate; and
  then those of Editha, who even as the old woman spoke had felt a tidal wave
  of long-forgotten memories sweeping right over her senses. The look in the
  Quakeress&rsquo;s eyes, the words she uttered&mdash;though still obscure
  and enigmatical&mdash;had already told her the whole truth. As in a flash
  she saw before her, her youth and all its follies, the gay life of thoughtlessness
  and pleasures, the cradles of her children, the tiny boys who to the woman
  of fashion were but a hindrance and a burden.</p>
  <p>She saw her own mother, rigid and dour, the counterpart of this same old
  Puritan who had not hesitated to part two children from their mother for
  over a score of years, any more than she hesitated now to fling insult upon
  insult on the wretched woman who had more than paid her debt to her own careless
  frivolity of long ago.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thy brother&rsquo;s name was Henry Adam de Chavasse, and thine Michael
  Richard de Chavasse, sons of Rowland de Chavasse, and of the wanton who was
  his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old woman had taken a packet of papers, yellow with age and stained
  with many tears, from out a secret drawer of the old oak dresser.</p>
  <p>Her voice was no longer tremulous as it was wont to be, but firm and dull,
  monotonous in tone like that of one who speaks whilst in a trance. Squire
  Boatfield had uttered an exclamation of boundless astonishment. Mechanically
  he took the packet of papers from the Quakeress&rsquo;s hand and after an
  instant&rsquo;s hesitation, and in response to an appealing look from Richard,
  he broke the string which held the documents together and perused them one
  by one.</p>
  <p>But Editha, even as the last of the old woman&rsquo;s words ceased to echo
  in the narrow room, had risen to her feet. Her heavy cloak glided off her
  shoulders down upon the ground; her eyes, preternaturally large, glowing
  and full of awe, were now fixed upon the young man&mdash;her son.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;De Chavasse,&rdquo; she murmured, her brain whirling, her heart filled
  not only with an awful terror, but also with a great and overwhelming joy. &ldquo;My
  sons ... then I am ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But with a peremptory gesture the Quakeress had stopped the word in her
  mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; she said loudly, &ldquo;do not pollute that sacred name
  by letting it pass through thy lips. Women such as thou were not made for
  motherhood.... Thy own mother knew that, when she took thy children from
  thee and cursed thee on her death-bed for thy sins and for thy shame! Thy
  sons were honest, God-fearing men, but &rsquo;tis no thanks to thee. Thou
  alone hast heaped shame upon their dead father&rsquo;s name and hast contrived
  to wreak ruin on the sons who knew thee not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Quakeress paused a moment, her pale opaque eyes lighted with an inward
  glow of wrath and of satisfied vengeance. She and her dead friend and all
  their co-religionists had hated the woman, who, in defiance of her own Puritanic
  upbringing, had cast aside her friends and her home in order to throw herself
  in that vortex of pleasure, which her mother considered evil and infamous.</p>
  <p>Together they had all rejoiced over this woman&rsquo;s subsequent humiliation,
  her sorrow and longing for her children, the ceaseless search, the ever-recurrent
  disappointments. Now the Quakeress&rsquo;s hour had come, hers and that of
  the whole of the dour sect who had taken it upon itself to punish and to
  avenge.</p>
  <p>Editha, shamed and miserable, not even daring now to approach her own son
  and to beg for affection with a look, stood quite rigid and pale, allowing
  the torrent of the old woman&rsquo;s pent-up hatred to fall upon her and
  to crush her with its rough cruelty.</p>
  <p>Squire Boatfield would have interposed. He had glanced at the various documents&mdash;the
  proofs of what the old woman had asserted&mdash;and was satisfied that the
  horrible tale of what seemed to him unparalleled cruelty was indeed true,
  and that the narrow bigotry of a community had succeeded in performing that
  monstrous crime of parting this wretched woman for twenty years from her
  sons.</p>
  <p>Vaguely in his mind, the kindly squire hoped that he&mdash;as magistrate&mdash;could
  fitly punish this crime of child-stealing, and the expression with which
  he now regarded the old Quakeress was certainly not one of good-will.</p>
  <p>Mistress Lambert had, in the meanwhile, approached Editha. She now took
  the younger woman&rsquo;s hand in hers and dragged her towards the coffin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There lies one of thy sons,&rdquo; she said with the same relentless
  energy, &ldquo;the eldest, who should have been thy pride, murdered in a
  dark spot by some skulking criminal.... Curse thee! ... curse thee, I say
  ... as thy mother cursed thee on her death-bed ... curse thee now that retribution
  has come at last!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her words died away, as some mournful echo against these whitewashed walls.</p>
  <p>For a moment she stood wrathful and defiant, upright and stern like a justiciary
  between the dead son and the miserable woman, who of a truth was suffering
  almost unendurable agony of mind and of heart.</p>
  <p>Then in the midst of the awesome silence that followed on that loudly spoken
  curse, there was the sound of a firm footstep on the rough deal floor, and
  the next moment Michael Richard de Chavasse was kneeling beside his mother,
  and covering her icy cold hand with kisses.</p>
  <p>A heart-broken moan escaped her throat. She stooped and with trembling lips
  gently touched the young head bent in simple love and uninquiring reverence
  before her.</p>
  <p>Then without a word, without a look cast either at her cruel enemy, or at
  the silent spectator of this terrible drama, she turned and ran rapidly out
  of the room, out into the dark and dismal night.</p>
  <p>With a deep sigh of content, Mistress Lambert fell on her knees and thence
  upon the floor.</p>
  <p>The old heart which had contained so much love and so much hatred, such
  stern self-sacrifice and such deadly revenge, had ceased to beat, now the
  worker&rsquo;s work was done.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter42"></a>Chapter 42<br>
  The Return</b></h2>
  <p>Master Courage Toogood had long ago given up all thought of waiting for
  the mistress. He had knocked repeatedly at the door of the cottage, from
  behind the thick panels of which he had heard loud and&mdash;he thought&mdash;angry
  voices, speaking words which he could not, however, quite understand.</p>
  <p>No answer had come to his knocking and tired with the excitement of the
  day, fearful, too, at the thought of the lonely walk which now awaited him,
  he chose to believe that mayhap he had either misunderstood his master&rsquo;s
  orders, or that Sir Marmaduke himself had been mistaken when he thought the
  mistress back at the cottage.</p>
  <p>These surmises were vastly to Master Courage Toogood&rsquo;s liking, whose
  name somewhat belied his timid personality. Swinging his lantern and striving
  to keep up his spirits by the aid of a lusty song, he resolutely turned his
  steps towards home.</p>
  <p>The whole landscape seemed filled with eeriness: the events of the day had
  left their impress on this dark November night, causing the sighs of the
  gale to seem more spectral and weird than usual, and the dim outline of the
  trees with their branches turned away from the coastline, to seem like unhappy
  spirits with thin, gaunt arms stretched dejectedly out toward the unresponsive
  distance.</p>
  <p>Master Toogood tried not to think of ghosts, nor of the many stories of
  pixies and goblins which are said to take a malicious pleasure in the timorousness
  of mankind, but of a truth he nearly uttered a cry of terror, and would have
  fallen on his knees in the mud, when a dark object quite undistinguishable
  in the gloom suddenly loomed before him.</p>
  <p>Yet this was only the portly figure of Master Pyot, the petty constable,
  who seemed to be mounting guard just outside the cottage, and who was vastly
  amused at Toogood&rsquo;s pusillanimity. He entered into converse with the
  young man&mdash;no doubt he, too, had been feeling somewhat lonely in the
  midst of this darkness, which was peopled with unseen shadows. Master Courage
  was ready enough to talk. He had acquired some of Master Busy&rsquo;s eloquence
  on the subject of secret investigations, and the mystery which had gained
  an intensity this afternoon, through the revelations of the old Quakeress,
  was an all-engrossing one to all.</p>
  <p>The attention which Pyot vouchsafed to his narration greatly enhanced Master
  Toogood&rsquo;s own delight therein, more especially as the petty constable
  had, as if instinctively, measured his steps with those of the younger man
  and was accompanying him on his way towards the Court.</p>
  <p>Courage told his attentive listener all about Master Busy&rsquo;s surmises
  and his determination to probe the secrets of the mysterious crime, which&mdash;to
  be quite truthful&mdash;the worthy butler with the hard toes had scented
  long ere it was committed, seeing that he used to spend long hours in vast
  discomfort in the forked branches of the old elms which surrounded the pavilion
  at the boundary of the park.</p>
  <p>Toogood had no notion if Master Busy had ever discovered anything of interest
  in the neighborhood of that pavilion, and he was quite, quite sure that the
  saintly man had never dared to venture inside that archaic building, which
  had the reputation of being haunted; still, he was over-gratified to perceive
  that the petty constable was vastly interested in his tale&mdash;in spite
  of these obvious defects in its completeness&mdash;and that, moreover, Master
  Pyot showed no signs of turning on his heel, but continued to trudge along
  the gloomy road in company with Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s youngest serving-man.</p>
  <p>Thus Editha, when she ran out of Mistress Lambert&rsquo;s cottage, her ears
  ringing with the fanatic&rsquo;s curses, her heart breaking with the joy
  of that reverent filial kiss imprinted upon her hands, found the road and
  the precincts of the cottage entirely deserted.</p>
  <p>The night was pitch dark after the rain. Great heavy clouds still hung above,
  and an icy blast caught her skirts as she lifted the latch of the gate and
  turned into the open.</p>
  <p>But she cared little about the inclemency of the weather. She knew her way
  about well enough and her mind was too full of terrible thoughts of what
  was real, to yield to the subtle and feeble fears engendered by imaginings
  of the supernatural.</p>
  <p>Nay! she would, mayhap, have welcomed the pixies and goblins who by mischievous
  pranks had claimed her attention. They would, of a truth, have diverted her
  mind from the contemplation of that awful and monstrous deed accomplished
  by the man whom she would meet anon.</p>
  <p>If he whom the villagers had called Adam Lambert was her son, Henry Adam
  de Chavasse, then Sir Marmaduke was the murderer of her child. All the curses
  which the old Quakeress had so vengefully poured upon her were as nothing
  compared with that awful, that terrible fact.</p>
  <p>Her son had been murdered ... her eldest son whom she had never known, and
  she&mdash;involuntarily mayhap, compulsorily certes&mdash;had in a measure
  helped to bring about those events which had culminated in that appalling
  crime.</p>
  <p>She had known of Marmaduke&rsquo;s monstrous fraud on the confiding girl
  whom he now so callously abandoned to her fate. She had known of it and helped
  him towards its success by luring her other son Richard to that vile gambling
  den where he had all but lost his honor, or else his reason.</p>
  <p>This knowledge and the help she had given was the real curse upon her now:
  a curse far more horrible and deadly than that which had driven Cain forth
  into the wilderness. This knowledge and the help she had given had stained
  her hands with the blood of her own child.</p>
  <p>No wonder that she sighed for ghouls and for shadowy monsters, well-nigh
  longing for a sight of distorted faces, of ugly deformed bodies, and loathsome
  shapes far less hideous than that specter of an inhuman homicide which followed
  her along this dark road as she ran&mdash;ran on&mdash;ran towards the home
  where dwelt the living monster of evil, the man who had done the deed, which
  she had helped to accomplish.</p>
  <p>Complete darkness reigned all around her, she could not see a yard of the
  road in front of her, but she went on blindly, guided by instinct, led by
  that unseen shadow which was driving her on. All round her the gale was moaning
  in the creaking branches of the trees, branches which were like arms stretched
  forth in appeal towards the unattainable.</p>
  <p>Her progress was slow for she was walking in the very teeth of the hurricane,
  and her shoes ever and anon remained glued to the slimy mud. But the road
  was straight enough, she knew it well, and she felt neither fatigue nor discomfort.</p>
  <p>Of Sue she did not think. The wrongs done to the defenseless girl were as
  nothing to her compared with the irreparable&mdash;the wrongs done to her
  sons, the living and the dead: for the one the foul dagger of an inhuman
  assassin, for the other shame and disgrace.</p>
  <p>Sue was young. Sue would soon forget. The girl-wife would soon regain her
  freedom.... But what of the mother who had on her soul the taint of the murder
  of her child?</p>
  <p>The gate leading to the Court from the road was wide open: it had been left
  so for her, no doubt, when Sir Marmaduke returned. The house itself was dark,
  no light save one pierced the interstices of the ill-fitting shutters. Editha
  paused a moment at the gate, looking at the house&mdash;a great black mass,
  blacker than the surrounding gloom. That had been her home for many years
  now, ever since her youth and sprightliness had vanished, and she had had
  nowhere to go for shelter. It had been her home ever since Richard, her youngest
  boy, had entered it, too, as a dependent.</p>
  <p>Oh! what an immeasurable fool she had been, how she had been tricked and
  fooled all these years by the man who two days ago had put a crown upon his
  own infamy. He knew where the boys were, he helped to keep them away from
  their mother, so as to filch from them their present, and above all, future
  inheritance. How she loathed him now, and loathed herself for having allowed
  him to drag her down. Aye! of a truth he had wronged her worse even than
  he had wronged his brother&rsquo;s sons!</p>
  <p>She fixed her eyes steadily on the one light which alone pierced the inky
  blackness of the solid mass of the house. It came from the little withdrawing-room,
  which was on the left of this entrance to the hall; but the place itself&mdash;beyond
  just that one tiny light&mdash;appeared quite silent and deserted. Even from
  the stableyard on her right and from the serving-men&rsquo;s quarters not
  a sound came to mingle with the weird whisperings of the wind.</p>
  <p>Editha approached and stooping to the ground, she groped in the mud until
  her hands encountered two or three pebbles.</p>
  <p>She picked them up, then going close to the house, she threw these pebbles
  one by one against the half-closed shutter of the withdrawing-room.</p>
  <p>The next moment, she heard the latch of the casement window being lifted
  from within, and anon the rickety shutter flew back with a thin creaking
  sound like that of an animal in pain.</p>
  <p>The upper part of Sir Marmaduke&rsquo;s figure appeared in the window embrasure,
  like a dark and massive silhouette against the yellowish light from within.
  He stooped forward, seeming to peer into the darkness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that you, Editha?&rdquo; he queried presently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Open!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She then waited a moment or two, whilst he closed both the shutter and the
  window, she standing the while on the stone step before the portico. In the
  stillness she could hear him open the drawing-room door, then cross the hall
  and finally unbolt the heavy outer door.</p>
  <p>She pushed past him over the threshold and went into the gloomy hall, pitch
  dark save for the flickering light of the candle which he held. She waited
  until he had re-closed the door, then she stood quite still, confronting
  him, allowing him to look into her face, to read the expression of her eyes.</p>
  <p>In order to do this he had raised the candle, his hand trembling perceptibly,
  and the feeble light quivered in his grasp, illumining her face at fitful
  intervals, creeping down her rigid shoulders and arms, as far as her hands,
  which were tightly clenched. It danced upon his face too, lighting it with
  weird gleams and fitful sparks, showing the wild look in his eyes, the glitter
  almost of madness in the dilated pupils, the dark iris sharply outlined against
  the glassy orbs. It licked the trembling lips and distorted mouth, the drawn
  nostrils and dank hair, almost alive with that nameless fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would denounce me?&rdquo; he murmured, and the cry&mdash;choked
  and toneless&mdash;could scarce rise from the dry parched throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>He uttered a violent curse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You devil ... you ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have time to go,&rdquo; she said calmly, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a
  long while &rsquo;twixt now and dawn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He understood. She only would denounce him if he stayed. She wished him
  no evil, only desired him out of her sight. He tried to say something flippant,
  something cruel and sneering, but she stopped him with a peremptory gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or I might forget everything save that
  you killed my son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment she thought that her life was in danger at his hands, so awful
  in its baffled rage was the expression of his face when he understood that
  indeed she knew everything. She even at that moment longed that his cruel
  instincts should prompt him to kill her. He could never succeed in hiding
  that crime and retributive justice would of a surety overtake him then, without
  any help from her.</p>
  <p>No doubt he, too, thought of this as the weird flicker of the candle-light
  showed him her unflinching face, for the next moment, with another muttered
  curse, and a careless shrug of the shoulders, he turned on his heel, and
  slowly went upstairs, candle in hand.</p>
  <p>Editha watched him until his massive figure was merged in the gloom of the
  heavy oak stairway. Then she went into the withdrawing-room and waited.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter43"></a>Chapter 43<br>
  The Sands Of Epple</b></h2>
  <p>Five minutes later Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, clad in thick dark doublet
  and breeches and wearing a heavy cloak, once more descended the stairs of
  Acol Court. He saw the light in the withdrawing-room and knew that Editha
  was there, mutely watching his departure.</p>
  <p>But he did not care to speak to her again. His mind had been quickly made
  up, nay! his actions in the immediate future should of a truth have been
  accomplished two days ago, ere the meddlesomeness of women had well-nigh
  jeopardized his own safety.</p>
  <p>All that he meant to do now was to go quickly to the pavilion, find the
  leather wallet then return to his own stableyard, saddle one of his nags
  and start forthwith for Dover. Eighteen miles would soon be covered, and
  though the night was dark, the road was straight and broad. De Chavasse knew
  it well, and had little fear of losing his way.</p>
  <p>With plenty of money in his purse, he would have no difficulty in chartering
  a boat which, with a favorable tide on the morrow, should soon take him over
  to France.</p>
  <p>All that he ought to have done two days ago! Of a truth, he had been a cowardly
  fool.</p>
  <p>He did not cross the hall this time but went out through the dining-room
  by the garden entrance. Not a glimmer of light came from above, but as he
  descended the few stone steps he felt that a few soft flakes of snow tossed
  by the hurricane were beginning to fall. Of course he knew every inch of
  his own garden and park and had oft wandered about on the further side of
  the ha-ha whilst indulging in lengthy sweetly-spoken farewells with his love-sick
  Sue.</p>
  <p>Absorbed in the thoughts of his immediate future plans, he nevertheless
  walked along cautiously, for the paths had become slippery with the snow,
  which froze quickly even as it fell.</p>
  <p>He did not pause, however, for he wished to lose no time. If he was to ride
  to Dover this night, he would have to go at foot-pace, for the road would
  be like glass if this snow and ice continued. Moreover, he was burning to
  feel that wallet once more between his fingers and to hear the welcome sound
  of the crushing of crisp papers.</p>
  <p>He had plunged resolutely into the thickness of the wood. Here he could
  have gone blindfolded, so oft had he trodden this path which leads under
  the overhanging elms straight to the pavilion, walking with Sue&rsquo;s little
  hand held tightly clasped in his own.</p>
  <p>The spiritual presence of the young girl seemed even now to pervade the
  thicket, her sweet fragrance to fill the frost-laden air.</p>
  <p>Bah! he was not the man to indulge in retrospective fancy. The girl was
  naught to him, and there was no sense of remorse in his soul for the terrible
  wrongs which he had inflicted on her. All that he thought of now was the
  wallet which contained the fortune. That which would forever compensate him
  for the agony, the madness of the past two days.</p>
  <p>The bend behind that last group of elms should now reveal the outline of
  the pavilion. Sir Marmaduke advanced more cautiously, for the trees here
  were very close together.</p>
  <p>The next moment he had paused, crouching suddenly like a carnivorous beast,
  balked of its prey. There of a truth was the pavilion, but on the steps three
  men were standing, talking volubly and in whispers. Two of these men carried
  stable lanterns, and were obviously guiding their companion up to the door
  of the pavilion.</p>
  <p>The light of the lanterns illumined one face after another. De Chavasse
  recognized his two serving-men, Busy and Toogood; the man who was with them
  was petty-constable Pyot. Marmaduke with both hands clutching the ivy which
  clung round the gnarled stem of an old elm, watched from out the darkness
  what these three men were doing here, beside this pavilion, which had always
  been so lonely and deserted.</p>
  <p>He could not distinguish what they said for they spoke in whispers and the
  creaking branches groaning beneath the wind drowned every sound which came
  from the direction of the pavilion and the listener on the watch, straining
  his every sense in order to hear, dared not creep any closer lest he be perceived.</p>
  <p>Anon, the three men examined the door of the pavilion, and shaking the rusty
  bolts, found that they would not yield. But evidently they were of set purpose,
  for the next moment all three put their shoulder to the worm-eaten woodwork,
  and after the third vigorous effort the door yielded to their assault.</p>
  <p>Men and lanterns disappeared within the pavilion. Sir Marmaduke heard an
  ejaculation of surprise, then one of profound satisfaction.</p>
  <p>For the space of a few seconds he remained rooted to the spot. It almost
  seemed to him as if with the knowledge that the wallet and the discarded
  clothes of the smith had been found, with the certitude that this discovery
  meant his own undoing probably, and in any case the final loss of the fortune
  for which he had plotted and planned, lied and masqueraded, killed a man
  and cheated a girl, that with the knowledge of all this, death descended
  upon him: so cold did he feel, so unable was he to make the slightest movement.</p>
  <p>But this numbness only lasted a few seconds. Obviously the three men would
  return in a minute or so; equally obviously his own presence here&mdash;if
  discovered&mdash;would mean certain ruin to him. Even while he was making
  the effort to collect his scattered senses and to move from this fateful
  and dangerous spot, he saw the three men reappear in the doorway of the pavilion.</p>
  <p>The breeches and rough shirt of the smith hung over the arm of Hymn-of-Praise
  Busy; the dark stain on the shirt was plainly visible by the light of one
  of the lanterns.</p>
  <p>Petty constable Pyot had the leather wallet in his hand, and was peeping
  down with grave curiosity at the bundle of papers which it contained.</p>
  <p>Then with infinite caution, Marmaduke de Chavasse worked his way between
  the trees towards the old wall which encircled his park. The three men obviously
  would be going back either to Acol Court, or mayhap, straight to the village.</p>
  <p>Sir Marmaduke knew of a gap in the wall which it was quite easy to climb,
  even in the dark; a path through the thicket at that point led straight out
  towards the coast.</p>
  <p>He had struck that path from the road on the night when he met the smith
  on the cliffs.</p>
  <p>The snow only penetrated in sparse flakes to the thicket here. Although
  the branches of the trees were dead, they interlaced so closely overhead
  that they formed ample protection against the wet.</p>
  <p>But the fury of the gale seemed terrific amongst these trees and the groaning
  of the branches seemed like weird cries proceeding from hell.</p>
  <p>Anon, the midnight walker reached the open. Here a carpet of coarse grass
  peeping through the thin layer of snow gave insecure foothold. He stumbled
  as he pursued his way. He was walking in the teeth of the northwesterly blast
  now and he could scarcely breathe, for the great gusts caught his throat,
  causing him to choke.</p>
  <p>Still he walked resolutely on. Icy moisture clung to his hair, and to his
  lips, and soon he could taste the brine in the air. The sound of the breakers
  some ninety feet below mingled weirdly with the groans of the wind.</p>
  <p>He knew the path well. Had he not trodden it three nights ago, on his way
  to meet the smith? Already in the gloom he could distinguish the broken line
  of the cliffs sharply defined against the gray density of the horizon.</p>
  <p>As he drew nearer the roar of the breakers became almost deafening. A heavy
  sea was rolling in on the breast of the tide.</p>
  <p>Still he walked along, towards the brow of the cliffs. Soon he could distinguish
  the irregular heap of chalk against which Adam had stood, whilst he had held
  the lantern in one hand and gripped the knife in the other.</p>
  <p>The hurricane nearly swept him off his feet. He had much ado to steady himself
  against that heap of chalk. The snow had covered his cloak and his hat, and
  he liked to think that he, too, now&mdash;snow-covered&mdash;must look like
  a monstrous chalk boulder, weird and motionless outlined against the leaden
  grayness of the ocean beyond.</p>
  <p>The smith was not by his side now. There was no lantern, no paper, no double-edged
  dagger. Down nearly a hundred feet below the smith had lain until the turn
  of the tide. The man&rsquo;s eyes, becoming accustomed to the gloom, could
  distinguish the points of the great boulders springing boldly from out the
  sand. The surf as it broke all round and over them was tipped with a phosphorescent
  light.</p>
  <p>The gale, in sheer wantonness, caught the midnight prowler&rsquo;s hat and
  with a wild sound as of the detonation of a hundred guns, tossed it to the
  waves below. The snow in a few moments had thrown a white pall over the watcher&rsquo;s
  head.</p>
  <p>He could see quite clearly the tall boulder untouched by the tide, on which
  he had placed the black silk shade that night, also the broad-brimmed hat,
  so that these things should be found high and dry and be easily recognizable.</p>
  <p>Some twenty feet further on was the smooth stretch of sand where had lain
  the smith, after he had been dressed up in the fantastic clothes of the mysterious
  French prince.</p>
  <p>Marmaduke de Chavasse gazed upon that spot. The breakers licked it now and
  again, leaving behind them as they retreated a track of slimy foam, which
  showed white in this strange gray gloom, rendered alive and moving by the
  falling snow.</p>
  <p>The surf covered that stretch of sand more and more frequently now, and
  retreated less and less far: the slimy foam floated now over an inky pool;
  soon that too disappeared. The breakers sought other boulders round which
  to play their titanic hide-and-seek. The tide had completely hidden the place
  where Adam Lambert had lain.</p>
  <p>Then the watcher walked on&mdash;one step and then another&mdash;and then
  the one beyond the edge as he stepped down, down into the abyss ninety feet
  below.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter44"></a>Chapter 44 <br>
  The Epilogue</b></h2>
  <p>The chronicles of the time tell us that the mysterious disappearance of
  Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse was but a nine days&rsquo; wonder in that great
  world which lies beyond the boundaries of sea-girt Thanet.</p>
  <p>What Thanet thought of it all, the little island kept secret, hiding its
  surmises in the thicket of her own archaic forests.</p>
  <p>Squire Boatfield did his best to wrap the disappearance of his whilom friend
  in impenetrable veils of mystery. He was a humane and a kindly man and feeling
  that the guilty had been amply punished, he set to work to cheer and to rehabilitate
  the innocent.</p>
  <p>All of us who have read the memoirs of Editha de Chavasse, written when
  she was a woman of nearly sixty, remember that she, too, has drawn a thick
  curtain over the latter days of her brother-in-law&rsquo;s life. It is to
  her pen that we owe the record of what happened subsequently.</p>
  <p>She tells us, for instance, how Master Skyffington, after sundry interviews
  with my Lord Northallerton, had the honor of bringing to his lordship&rsquo;s
  notice the young student&mdash;so long known as Richard Lambert&mdash;who,
  of a truth, was sole heir to the earldom and to its magnificent possessions
  and dependencies.</p>
  <p>From the memoirs of Editha de Chavasse we also know that Lady Sue Aldmarshe,
  girl-wife and widow, did, after a period of mourning, marry Michael Richard
  de Chavasse, sole surviving nephew and heir presumptive of his lordship the
  Earl of Northallerton.</p>
  <p>But it is to the brush of Sir Peter Lely that we owe that exquisite portrait
  of Sue, when she was Countess of Northallerton, the friend of Queen Catherine,
  the acknowledged beauty at the Court of the Restoration.</p>
  <p>It is a sweet face, whereon the half-obliterated lines of sorrow vie with
  that look of supreme happiness which first crept into her eyes when she realized
  that the dear and constant friend who had loved her so dearly, was as true
  to her in his joy as he had been in those dark days when a terrible crisis
  had well-nigh wrecked her life.</p>
  <p>Lord and Lady Northallerton did not often stay in London. The brilliance
  of the Court had few attractions for them. Happiness came to them after terrible
  sorrows. They liked to hide it and their great love in the calm and mystery
  of forest-covered Thanet.</p>
