<p><i>The readers of this pamphlet are no doubt aware that the
anxiety entertained for the fate of Burke and Wills led to the
formation of several expeditions in their search. The first of
these was formed in Melbourne and entrusted to the command of Mr.
Howitt. The second in Adelaide, under Mr. McKinlay. The third from
Rockhampton, under Mr. Walker; and the fourth from Brisbane, under
Mr. Landsborough. These several expeditions were organised and
started within a short period of each other. The steamship
Victoria, Commander Norman, was despatched by the Victorian
Government to the Gulf of Carpentaria to assist the explorers in
carrying out their objects.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Mr. Howitt, as is well-known, early succeeded in ascertaining
the melancholy fate of Burke and Wills: but before his letter
announcing it reached Melbourne the other expeditions referred to
had set out.</i>
</p>

<p><i>The brig Firefly was chartered in Melbourne to take from
Brisbane to Carpentaria Mr. Landsborough's party and equipments,
and also some stores for Mr. Walker's party, the latter having been
instructed to proceed from Rockhampton overland, by the shortest
route, to a rendezvous at the Gulf. The Firefly, having reached
Moreton Bay and shipped the horses, set sail for Carpentaria on the
24th August with Mr. Landsborough and his party.</i>
</p>

<p><i>As it is the object of this pamphlet to give details,
especially of his expedition, the journal, letters, etc., which
follow, are now presented.</i>
</p>

<p>&mdash;From the Introduction to "Journal of Landsborough's
Expedition" by William Landsborough.</p>
