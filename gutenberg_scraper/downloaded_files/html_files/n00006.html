  <h2>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>

  <p>On the last day of May 1902 the signature at Pretoria of the conditions of
  peace brought to an end a war which had lasted for nearly three years, and
  had among other things destroyed a government, dissolved a society, and laid
  waste a country. In those last months of fighting some progress had been made
  with the reconstruction&mdash;at least with that not unimportant branch of it
  which is concerned with the machinery of government. A working administration
  had been put together, new ordinances in the form of proclamations had been
  issued, departments had been created and the chief appointments made, the
  gold industry was beginning to set its house in order, refugees were
  returning, and already political theories were being mooted and future
  parties foreshadowed. But it is from the conclusion of peace that the work of
  resettlement may fairly be taken to commence. Before that date the
  restrictions of war limited all civil activity; not till the shackles were
  removed and the civil power left in sole possession does a fair field appear
  either for approval or criticism.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x"
     id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> It is not my purpose to write the history of
     the reconstruction. The work is still in process, and a decade later it
     may be formally completed. Fifty years hence it may be possible to look
     back and discriminate on its success or failure. The history when it is
     written will be an interesting book. It will among other matters deal with
     the work of repatriation, one of the most curious and quixotic burdens
     ever borne by a nation, and one, I believe, to which no real parallel can
     be found. It will concern itself with the slow and difficult transference
     from military to civil government, the renascence of the common law, the
     first revival of trade and industry, the restitution of prisoners, and the
     return of refugees&mdash;all matters of interest and novel precedents in
     our history. It will recognise more clearly than is at present possible
     the problems which faced South Africa at the time, and it will be in the
     happy position of judging from the high standpoint of accomplished fact.
     But in the meantime, when we have seen barely eighteen months of
     reconstruction, history is out of the question. Yet even in the stress of
     work it is often sound policy for a man to halt for a moment and collect
     his thoughts. There must be some diagnosis of the problem before him, the
     end to which his work is directed, the conditions under which he labours.
     While it is useless to tell the story of a task before it is done, it is
     often politic to re-examine the difficulties and to get the mind clear as
     to what the object of all this strife and expense of money and energy may
     be. Ideals are all very well in their way, but they are apt to become
     <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi"
     id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> very dim lamps unless often replenished
     from the world of facts and trimmed and adjusted by wholesome
     criticism.</p>

  <p>Such a modest diagnosis is the aim of the present work. I have tried in
  the main to state as clearly as I could the outstanding problems of South
  African politics as they appear to one observer. I say &ldquo;in the
  main,&rdquo; because I am aware that I have been frequently led against my
  intention to express an opinion on more than one such problem, and in several
  cases to suggest a policy. I can only plead that it is almost impossible to
  keep a statement of a case uncoloured by one&rsquo;s own view of the
  solution, and that it is better to give frankly a judgment, however
  worthless, than to allow a bias to influence insensibly the presentation of
  facts. For such views, which are my own, I claim no value; for facts, in so
  far as they are facts, I hope I may beg some little attention. They are the
  fruit of first-hand, and, I trust, honest observation. Every statement of a
  case is, indeed, a personal one, representing the writer&rsquo;s own estimate
  rather than objective truth, but in all likelihood it is several degrees
  nearer the truth than the same writer&rsquo;s policies or prophecies. South
  Africa has been in the world&rsquo;s eye for half a century, and in the last
  few years her problems have been so complex that it has been difficult to
  separate the permanent from the transitory, or to look beyond the mass of
  local difficulties to the abiding needs of the sub-continent as a whole.
  Colonial opinion has been neglected at <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_xii"
     id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> home; English opinion has been
     misunderstood in the colonies. It may be of interest to try to estimate
     her chief needs and to understand her thoughts, for it is only thus that
     we can forecast that future which she and she alone must make for
     herself.</p>

  <p>Every one who approaches the consideration of the politics of a country
  which is not his own, and in which he is at best a stranger, must feel a
  certain diffidence. On many matters it is impossible that he should judge
  correctly. What seems to him a simple fact is complicated, it may be, by a
  thousand unseen local currents which no one can allow for except the old
  inhabitant. For this reason an outside critic will be wrong in innumerable
  details, and even, it is probable, in certain broad questions of principle.
  But aloofness may have the qualities of its defects. A critic on a
  neighbouring hill-top will be a poor guide to the flora and fauna of the
  parish below; but he may be a good authority on its contours, on the height
  of its hills and the number of its rivers, and he may, perhaps, be a better
  judge of the magnitude of a thunderstorm coming out of the west than the
  parishioner in his garden. The insistence of certain South African problems,
  familiar to us all, has made any synthetic survey difficult for the South
  African and impossible for the newspaper reader at home. We have forgotten
  that it is a country with a history, that it is a land where men can live as
  well as wrangle and fight, that it has sport, traditions, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii"
     id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> charm of scenery and weather; and in
     its politics we are apt to see the problems under a few popular
     categories, rather as a war of catchwords than the birth-pangs of a
     people. I have attempted in the following pages to give this synthesis at
     the expense, I am afraid, of completeness of detail. It is my hope that
     some few readers may find utility even in an imperfect general survey as a
     corrective and a supplement to the many able expositions of single
     problems.</p>

  <p>The title begs a question which it is the aim of the later chapters to
  answer. South Africa is in reality one colony, and it can only be a matter of
  years till this radical truth is formally recognised in a federation. But
  some explanation is necessary for the fact that most of the book is occupied
  with a discussion of the new colonies and with problems which, for the
  present, may seem to exist only for them. At this moment the settlement of
  the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony is the most vital South African
  problem. On their success or failure depends the whole future of the
  sub-continent. They show, not in embryo, but in the strongest light and the
  clearest and most mature form, every South African question. On them depends
  the future wealth of the country and any marked increase in its population.
  They will be forced by their position to be in the van of South African
  progress, and to give the lead in new methods of expansion and development.
  We are therefore fortunate in possessing in the politics of these colonies an
  isolated and focussed observation-ground, a page <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv"
     id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> where we can read in large clear type
     what is elsewhere blurred and written over. I do not suppose that this
     fact would be denied by any of the neighbouring colonies; indeed the
     tendency in those states is to manifest an undue interest in the affairs
     of the Transvaal, and to see often, in matters which are purely local,
     questions of far-reaching South African interest. On the ultimate
     dominance of the Transvaal opinion naturally differs, and indeed it is a
     point not worth insisting on, save as a further argument for federation.
     If South African interests are so inextricably intertwined, it is clearly
     desirable to have a colony, whose future is obscure but whose wealth and
     power are at least potentially very great, brought formally into a union
     where each colony will be one unit and no more, rather than allow it to
     exist in isolation, unamenable to advice from sister states and wholly
     self-centred and unsympathetic. It is sufficient justification for the
     method I have employed if it is admitted that the Transvaal question is
     the South African problem in its most complete and characteristic
     form.</p>

  <p>A word remains to be said on the arrangement of the chapters. I have tried
  to write what is a kind of guide-book, not to details, but to the
  constituents of that national life which is now in process of growth. The
  reader I have had in mind is the average Englishman who, in seeking to be
  informed about a country, asks for something more than the dry bones of
  statistics&mdash;<i>l&rsquo;homme moyen politique</i>, who wants a
  <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the political problem, some guide to the
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv"
     id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> historical influences which have been or
     are still potent, an idea of landscape and national character and modes of
     life. He does not ask for a history, nor does he want a disquisition on
     this or that question, or a brief for this or that policy, but, being
     perfectly competent to make up his own mind, he wants the materials for
     judgment. The first part consists of brief historical sketches, dealing
     with the genesis of the three populations&mdash;native, uitlander, and
     Boer. The history of South Africa, with all deference to the learned and
     voluminous works of Dr Theal, can never be adequately written. Her past
     appears to us in a series of vanishing pictures, without continuity or
     connection. I have therefore avoided any attempt at a consecutive tale, as
     I have avoided such topics as the War and the negotiations preceding it,
     and treated a few historical influences in a brief episodic form. In the
     second part the configuration of the land has been dealt with in a similar
     way. A series of short sketches, of the class which the French call
     &ldquo;<i>carnets de voyage</i>,&rdquo; seemed more suitable than any
     attempt at the work of a gazetteer. I am so convinced of the beauty and
     healthfulness of the land that I may have been betrayed into an
     over-minute description: my one excuse is that in this branch of my task I
     have had few predecessors.</p>

  <p>The third part is highly controversial in character, and is presented with
  grave hesitation. Many books and pamphlets have informed us on those years of
  South African history between the Raid and the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "Page_xvi"
     id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span> Ultimatum, and a still greater number
     have discussed every phase and detail of the war. Another book on so
     hackneyed a matter may seem hard to justify. It may be urged, however,
     that the question has taken a wholly different form. Of late years it has
     been complicated by a division of opinion based not only on political but
     on moral grounds, an opposition in theories of national duty, of
     international ethics, of civic integrity. South African policy before the
     war and during the actual conduct of hostilities was by a considerable
     section of the English people not judged on political grounds, but
     condemned or applauded in the one case on moral pretexts and in the other
     on the common grounds of patriotism. The danger of making the moral
     criterion bulk aggressively in politics is that the criticism so desirable
     for all policies is neglected or perfunctorily performed. Matters which,
     to be judged truly, must be tried by the canons of the province to which
     they belong, are hastily approved or as hastily damned on some wholly
     alien test. But with the end of the war and the beginning of civil
     government it seems to me that this vice must tend to disappear. Whatever
     our judgment on the past, there is a living and insistent problem for the
     present. Whatever the verdict on our efforts to meet the problem, it must
     be based on political grounds. We are now in a position to criticise, if
     not adequately, at least fairly and on a logical basis. But the old data
     require revision. The war has been a chemical process which has so changed
     the nature of the old constituents <span class="pagenum"><a name=
     "Page_xvii"
     id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> that they are unrecognisable in a new
     analysis. I am encouraged to hope that a sketch of the political problem
     as it has to be faced in South Africa to-day will not be without a certain
     value to those who desire to inform themselves on what is the most
     interesting of modern imperial experiments. It is too often assumed in
     England that the real difficulties preceded war, and that the course of
     policy, though not unattended with risks, is now comparatively clear and
     easy. It would be truer to say that the real difficulty has only now
     begun. I shall be satisfied if I can convince some of my readers that the
     work to be done in South Africa is exceedingly delicate and arduous,
     requiring a high measure of judgment and tact and patience; that it is
     South Africa&rsquo;s own problem which she must settle for herself; and
     above all, that while the result of success will be more far-reaching and
     vital to the future of the English race than is commonly realised, the
     consequences of failure will be wholly disastrous to any vision of
     Empire.</p>

  <p>To my friends in South Africa I owe an apology for my audacity in
  undertaking to pronounce upon a country of which my experience is limited.
  Had I not always found them ready to welcome outside criticism, however
  imperfect, when honestly made, and to hear with commendable patience a
  newcomer&rsquo;s views, however crude, I should have hesitated long before
  making the attempt. I have endeavoured to give a plain statement of local
  opinion, which is expert opinion, and therefore worthy of the first
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii"
     id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> consideration, and, though there are
     phases of it with which I am not in sympathy, I trust I may claim to have
     given on many matters the colonial view, when such a view has attained
     consistency and clearness. But my chief excuse is that while local opinion
     is still in the making, and politics are still in the flux which attends a
     reconstruction, the outside spectator may in all modesty claim to have a
     voice. It may be easier for a man coming fresh to a new world to judge it
     correctly than for those ex-inhabitants of that older world on whose
     wreckage the new is built.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h4>PRIMITIVE SOUTH AFRICA.</h4>

<p>There are kinds of history which a modern education
ignores, and which a modern mind is hardly trained
to understand. We can interest ourselves keenly in
the first vagaries of embryo humankind; and for savagery,
which is a hunting-ground for the sociologist
and the folk-lorist, we have an academic respect. But
for savagery naked and not ashamed, fighting its own
battles and ruling its own peoples, we reserve an
interest only when it reaches literary record in a
saga. Otherwise it is for us neither literature nor
history&mdash;a kind of natural event like a thunderstorm,
of possible political importance, but of undoubted
practical dulness. Most men have never heard of
Vechtkop or Mosega, and know Tchaka and Dingaan
and Moshesh only as barbarous names. And yet
this is a history of curious interest and far-reaching
significance: the chronicle of Tchaka&rsquo;s deeds is an
epic, and we still feel the results of his iron arguments.
The current attitude is part of a general
false conception of South African conditions. To most
men she is a country without history, or, if she has
a certain barbarous chronicle, it is without significance.
The truth is nearly at the opposite pole.
South Africa is bound to the chariot-wheels of her
past, and that past is intricately varied&mdash;a museum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of the wrecks of conquerors and races, joining hands
with most quarters of the Old World. More, it is
the place where savagery is most intimately linked
with latter-day civilisation. Ph&oelig;nician, Arab, Portuguese,
Dutch, and English&mdash;that is her Uitlander
cycle; and a cynic might say that she has ended as
she began, with the Semitic. And meantime there
were great native conquests surging in the interior
while the adventurer was nibbling at her coasts;
and when we were busy in one quarter abolishing
slavery and educating the Kaffir, in another there
were wars more bloody than Timour&rsquo;s, and annihilation
of races more terrible than Attila ever dreamed
of. We see, before our faces, &ldquo;the rudiments of tiger
and baboon, and know that the barriers of races are
not so firm but that spray can sprinkle us from antediluvian
seas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To realise this intricate history and its modern
meaning is the first South African problem. No
man can understand the land unless he takes it as it
is, a place instinct with tradition, where every problem
is based upon the wreckage of old strifes. And
to the mere amateur the question is full of interest.
The history of South Africa can never be written.
The materials are lost, and all we possess are fleeting
glimpses, outcrops of fact on the wide plains of tradition,
random guesses, stray relics which suggest without
enlightening. We see races emerge and vanish,
with a place-name or a tomb as their only memorial;
but bequeathing something, we know not what, to
the land and their successors. And at the end of the
roll come the first white masters of the land, the
Dutch, whom it is impossible to understand except
in relation to the country which they conquered and
the people they superseded. We have unthinkingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
set down one of the most curious side-products of the
human family as a common race of emigrants, and
the result has been one long tale of misapprehension.
It is this overlapping of counter-civilisations, this
mosaic of the prehistoric and the recent, which gives
South African history its piquancy and its character.
It is no tale of old populous cities and splendid empires,
no story of developing civilisations and conflicting
philosophies; only a wild half-heard legend of
men who come out of the darkness for a moment, of
shapes warring in a mist for centuries, till the curtain
lifts and we recognise the faces of to-day.</p>

<p>Two views have been held on the subject of the
present native population. One is that it represents
the end of a long line of development; the other that
it is the nadir of a process of retrogression. The
supporters of the second view point to the growing
weakness of all Kaffir languages in inflexions and
structural forms, while in the Hottentot-Bushman
survival they see a degeneration from a more masculine
type. It is impossible to dogmatise on such a
matter. Degeneration and advance are not fixed
processes, but recur in cycles in the history of every
nation. The Bushman, one of the lowest of created
types, may well be the original creature of the soil,
advancing in halting stages from the palfolithic man;
himself practically a being of the Stone Age, and
prohibited from further progress by an arid and unfriendly
land, and the advent of stronger races. Of
the palfolithic man, who 200,000 years ago or thereabout
made his home in the river drifts, we have
geological records similar to those found in the valleys
of the Somme and the Thames. On the banks of the
Buffalo at East London, in a gravel deposit 70 feet
above the present river-bed, there have been found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
rude human implements of greenstone, the age of
which may be measured by the time the river has
taken to wear down 70 feet of hard greenstone dyke.<a name="FNanchor_1_1"
id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
From the palfolithic it is a step of a few millenniums
to the neolithic man, who has left his relics in the
shell-heaps and kitchen-middens at the mouth of the
same stream&mdash;who, indeed, till a few generations ago
was an inhabitant of the land. The Bushman was a
dweller in the Stone Age, for, though he knew a little
about metals, stone implements were in daily use,
and, with his kinsmen the Pigmies of Central Africa,
he represented a savagery compared with which the
Kaffir races are civilised. It is his skull which is
found in the shell-heaps by the river-sides. He was
a miserable fellow, a true troglodyte, small, emaciated,
with protruding chest and spindle legs. He lived
by hunting of the most primitive kind, killing game
with his poisoned arrows. He had no social organisation,
no knowledge of husbandry or stock-keeping,
and save for his unrivalled skill in following spoor
and a rude elementary art which is shown in the
Bushman pictures on some of the rocks in the western
districts, he was scarcely to be distinguished from
the beasts he hunted. A genuine neolithic man,
and therefore worthy of all attention. In other lands
his wild contemporaries have gone; in South Africa
the elephant, the rhinoceros, and the buffalo survive
to give the background to our picture of his life. He
himself has perished, or all but perished. The Dutch
farmers hunted him down and shot him at sight, for
indeed he was untamable. His blood has probably
mixed with the Hottentot and the Koranna; and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
some outland parts of the Kalahari and the great
wastes along the lower Orange he may survive in
twos and threes.</p>

<p>Originally he covered all the south-west corner of
Africa, but in time he had to retire from the richer
coast lands in favour of a people a little higher in the
scale of civilisation. The origin of the Hottentots is
shrouded in utter mystery, but we find them in possession
when the first Portuguese and Dutch explorers
reached the coast. They, too, were an insignificant
race, but so far an advance upon their predecessors
that they were shepherds, owning large herds of
sheep and horned cattle, and roaming over wide tracts
in search of pasture. They had a tribal organisation,
and a certain domesticity of nature which, while it
made them an easy prey to warrior tribes, enabled
them to live side by side with the Dutch immigrants
as herdsmen and house-servants. The pure breed
disappeared, but their blood remains in the Cape
boy, that curious mixed race part white, part Malay,
part Hottentot. Both Bushman and Hottentot, having
within them no real vitality, have perished utterly
as peoples: in Emerson&rsquo;s words, they &ldquo;had guano in
their destiny,&rdquo; and were fated only to prepare the
way for their successors.</p>

<p>For the rest the history of primitive South Africa is
a history of the Bantu tribes but for one curious exception.
In the districts now included in the general
name of Rhodesia, stretching from the Zambesi to the
Limpopo, we find authentic record of an old and
mysterious civilisation compared with which all African
empires, save Egypt, are things of yesterday. Over
five hundred ruins, showing in the main one type,
though a type which can be differentiated in stages,
are hidden among the hollows and stony hills of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
curious country. Livingstone and Baines first called
the world&rsquo;s attention to those monuments, and Mr
Bent, in his &lsquo;Ruined Cities of Mashonaland,&rsquo; provided
the first working theory of their origin. Since that
date many savants, from Dr Schlichter to Professor
Keane, have elaborated the hypothesis, for in the
present state of our knowledge a hypothesis it remains.
In those ruins, or Zimbabwes, to use the generic Bantu
name, three distinct periods have been traced, and a
fourth period, when it is supposed that local tribes
began to imitate the Zimbabwe style of architecture.
The features of this architecture are simple, and consist
chiefly of immense thickness of wall ornamented with
a herring-bone, a chess-board, and in a few instances a
diaper pattern, enclosures entered by narrow winding
passages, and in some cases conical towers similar to
the Sardinian <i>nauraghes</i>. The discoveries by excavation
have not been many, mainly fragments of gold
and gold-dust, certain bowls of soapstone and wood
ornamented with geometrical patterns and figures
which may represent the signs of the zodiac, some
curious figures of birds, stone objects which may be
<i>phalli</i>, and rude stones which may be the sacred <i>betyli</i>.
It is difficult to judge of the purpose of the buildings.
Some suggest forts, some temples, some factories, some
palaces: perhaps they may be all combined, such as
we know the early Ionian and Ph&oelig;nician adventurers
built in a new land.</p>

<p>From the remains themselves little light comes, but
we have a certain assistance from known history. In
early days, before the Ph&oelig;nicians came to the Mediterranean
seaboard, their precursors, the Sabfo-Arabians
or Himyarites of South Arabia, were the great commercial
people of the East. There was undoubtedly a
large trade in gold and ivory with Africa, and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
records point to somewhere on the Mozambique coast
as the port from which the precious metal was shipped.
The only place whence gold in great quantities could
have come is the central tableland of Rhodesia, from
which it has been estimated that the ancient output
was of the value of at least 75 millions. The temple
of Haram of Bilkis, near Marib, as described by M|ller,
has an extraordinary resemblance both in architecture
and the relics found in it to the Great Zimbabwe.
According to Professor Keane, the Sabfans reached
Rhodesia by way of Madagascar, and he finds in the
Malagasy language traces of their presence. Ophir he
places in the south of Arabia, the emporium to which
the gold was brought for distribution; Tarshish, the
port of embarkation, he identifies with Sofala; and he
finds in Rhodesia the ancient Havilah. Others place
Ophir in Rhodesia itself. According to the Portuguese
writer Conto, Mount Fura in Rhodesia was called by
the Arabs Afur, and some see in the names of Sofala
and the Sabi river a reference to Ophir and Sheba.
Etymological proofs are always suspicious, save in cases
like this where they are merely supplementary to a vast
quantity of collateral evidence. When the Ph&oelig;nicians
succeeded to the commercial empire of the Sabfans,
they took over the land of Ophir, and to them the
bulk of the Zimbabwes are to be attributed. Those
later Zimbabwes and the Sardinian <i>nauraghes</i>, which
are almost certainly Ph&oelig;nician in origin, have many
points of resemblance. The traces of litholatry and
phallic worship are Ph&oelig;nician, the soapstone birds
may be the vultures of Astarte, and the rosette
decorations on the stone cylinders are found in the
Ph&oelig;nician temple of Paphos and the great temple of
the Sun at Emesa.</p>

<p>Such are a few of the proofs advanced on behalf of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
hypothesis which is in itself highly probable.<a name="FNanchor_2_2"
id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is
not a history of generations but of fons, and we
cannot tell what were the fortunes of that mysterious
land from the days when the Ph&oelig;nician power
dwindled away to the time when the Portuguese
discovered the gold mines and framed wild legends
about Monomotapa. The most probable theory is that
the old Semitic settlers mingled their blood with the
people of the land, and as the trade outlets became
closed a native tribe took the place of the proud
Ph&oelig;nician merchants. In the words of Mr Selous,
&ldquo;the blood of the ancient builders of Zimbabwe still
runs, in a very diluted form, in the veins of the Bantu
races, and more especially among the remnants of the
tribes still living in Mashonaland and the Barotsi of
the Upper Zambesi.&rdquo; The Makalanga, or Children of
the Sun, whom Barreto fought, were in the line of
succession from the Ph&oelig;nicians, as the Mashonas are
their representatives to-day. In Mashona pottery we
can still trace the decorations, which are found on the
walls of the Zimbabwes: the people have something
Semitic in their features, as compared with other
Bantu tribes; they know something of gold-working,
a little of astronomy, and in their industries and
beliefs have a higher culture than their neighbours.
Their chiefs have dynastic names; each tribe has a
form of totemism in which some have seen Arabian
influences; and in certain matters of religion, such as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the sacrifice of black bulls and the observation of days
of rest, they suggest Semitic customs. So, if this
hypothesis be true, we are presented with a survival
of the oldest of civilisations in the heart of modern
barbarism. The traveller, who sees in the wilds of
Manicaland a sacrifice of oxen to the Manes of the
tribe, sees in a crude imitation the rites which the
hook-nosed, dark-eyed adventurers brought from the
old splendid cities of the Mediterranean, where with
wild music and unspeakable cruelties and lusts the
votaries of Baal and Astarte celebrated the cycle of
the seasons and the mysteries of the natural world&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">&ldquo;Imperishable fire under the boughs<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And chrysoprase and ruby and sardonyx.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the Portuguese first landed in East Africa
the chief tribe with which they came in contact was
the Makalanga in Mashonaland, ruled by the Monomotapa.
But before their power waned they had
seen that nation vanquished and scattered by the
attacks of fiercer tribes from the north, particularly
the Mazimba, in whose name there may lurk a trace
of the Agizymba, a country to which, according to
Ptolemy, the Romans penetrated. For the last four
centuries native South Africa has been the theatre
of a continuous <i>vvlkerwanderung</i>, immigrations from
the north, and in consequence a general displacement,
so that no tribe can claim an ancient possession
of its territory. We may detect, apart
from the Mashonas, three chief race families among
the Bantus&mdash;the Ovampas and people of German
South Africa; the Bechuanas and Basutos; and the
great mixed race of which the Zulus and the Kaffirs
of Eastern Cape Colony are the chief representatives.
All the groups show a strong family likeness in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
customs, worship, and physical character. As a rule
the men are tall and well-formed, and their features
are more shapely than the ordinary negro of West
Africa or the far interior. They have a knowledge
of husbandry and some skill in metal-working; they
have often shown remarkable courage in the field and
a kind of rude discipline; and they dwell in a society
which is rigidly, if crudely, organised. The Custom of
the Ancients is the main rule in their lives, and such
law as they possess owes its sanction to this authority.
The family is the social unit; and families are combined
into clans, and clans into tribes, with one paramount
chief at the head, whose power in most instances
is despotic, as becomes a military chief. In
some of the tribes, notably the Bechuana-Basuto, we
find rudiments of popular government, where the chief
has to take the advice of the assembled people, as in
the Basuto <i>pitso</i>, or, in a few cases, of a council of the
chief indunas. The chief&rsquo;s authority as lawgiver is
absolute, but his judgments are supposed to be only
declaratory of ancient custom. Socially the tribes
are polygamous, and sexual morality is low, though
certain crimes are reprobated and severely punished.
The prevailing religion is ancestor-worship, joined
with a rude form of natural dfmonism. The ordinary
Bantu is not an idolater like the Makalanga, but he
walks in terror of unseen spirits which dwell in the
woods and rivers,&mdash;the ghost of his father it may be,
or some unattached devils. Ghost feasts are made at
stated times on the graves of the dead; and if the
ghost has been whimsical enough to enter the body of
an animal, that animal must be jealously respected.
Each tribe has its totem&mdash;the lion, or the antelope,
or the crocodile&mdash;from which they derive their descent,
one of the commonest features of all primitive societies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
There seem traces of a vague belief in a superior deity,
who makes rain and thunder and controls the itinerant
bands of ghosts&mdash;a great ghost, who, if properly supplicated,
may intercede with the smaller and more
troublesome herd. But abstractions are essentially
foreign to the Bantu mind, and his modest Pantheon
is filled with the simplest of deities.</p>

<p>No priesthood exists, but it is possible for a clever
man to learn some of the tricks of disembodied spirits
and frustrate them by his own skill. In this way a
class of sorcerers arose, who dealt in big medicine and
strong magic. They profess to make rain and receive
communications from the unseen, to cure diseases and
give increase to the flocks, to expound the past and
foretell the future. This powerful class is jealous of
amateurs, and does its best to remove inferior wizards;
but they are always liable to be annihilated themselves
by a powerful chief, who is more bloodthirsty
than superstitious. Undoubtedly some of these
sorcerers acquire a knowledge of certain natural
secrets; they become skilled meteorologists, and seem
to possess a crude knowledge of hypnotism. They are
also physicians of considerable attainments, and certain
native remedies, notably a distillation of herbs, which
is used for dysentery in Swaziland, have a claim to a
place in a civilised pharmacop&oelig;ia. This rough science
is the only serious intellectual attainment of the
Bantu, outside of warfare. They have a kind of
music which is extremely doleful and monotonous;
they have a rude art, chiefly employed in the decoration
of their weapons; but they have no poetry
worthy of the name; and their only literature is found
in certain simple folk-tales, chiefly of animals, but in
a few cases of human escapades and feats of sorcery.
The lion is generally the butt of such stories, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
quick wit of the hare and the knavery of the jackal
are held up to the admiration of the listeners.<a name="FNanchor_3_3"
id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Such are the chief features of Bantu life, and so
lived the natives of South Africa up to the early years
of last century. But about that time a certain Dingiswayo,
being in exile at Cape Town, saw a company
of British soldiers at drill, and, being an intelligent
man, acquired a new idea of the art of war. When he
returned to his home and the chieftainship of the little
Zulu tribe, the memory of the soldiers in shakos, who
moved as one man, remained with him, and he began
to experiment with his army. He died, and his lieutenant
Tchaka succeeded to the command of a small
but well-disciplined force. This Tchaka was one of
those born leaders of men in battle who appear on
the stage of history every century or so. He perfected
the discipline of his army, armed it with short stabbing
spears for close-quarter fighting, and then proceeded
to use it as a wedge to split the large loose masses
which surrounded him. It was a war of the eagle and
the crows. Neighbouring tribes awoke one morning
to find the enemy at their gates, and by the evening
they had ceased to exist. A wild flight to the north
began, and for years the wastes north and east of the
Drakensberg were littered with flying remnants of
broken clans. All the great deeds of savage warfare&mdash;the
killing of the Suitors, the fight in the Great
Hall of Worms, Cuchulain&rsquo;s doings in the war of the
Bull of Cuailgne&mdash;pale before the barbaric splendours
of Tchaka&rsquo;s slaughterings, the Zulus became the imperial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
power of South-East Africa, and their monarch&rsquo;s
authority was limited only by the length of his impis&rsquo;
reach. By-and-by his career of storm ceases. We
find him ruling as a severe and much-venerated king,
arbitrary and bloodthirsty but comparatively honest;
a huge man, with many large vices and a few glimmerings
of virtue. He was succeeded by his brother,
the monstrous Dingaan, who was soundly beaten by
the Boers in one of the most heroic battles in history;
he in turn gave way to his brother Panda, a figure of
small note; and the dynasty ended with Cetewayo and
the blood and terror of Isandhlwana and Ulundi.</p>

<p>After Tchaka the man who looms largest in the
tale of those wars is Mosilikatse, the founder of the
Matabele. The Zulu conquests placed terrible autocrats
on the throne, and the marshal who incurred the
king&rsquo;s displeasure had to flee or perish. To this circumstance
we owe the Angoni in Nyassaland and the
empire of Lobengula. About 1817 Mosilikatse with
his impi burst into what is now the Orange River
Colony, driving before him the feeble Barolong and
Bechuana tribes, and established his court at a place
on the Crocodile River north of the Magaliesberg,
where a pass still bears his name. He began a
career of wholesale rapine and slaughter, till, as
Fate would have it, he came in contact with the
pioneers of the Great Trek. Some hideous massacres
were the result, but he had to deal with an enemy
against whom his race could never hope to stand.
The Boers, under Uys and Potgieter, drove him from
his kraal, impounded his ill-gotten cattle, and finally,
in a great battle on the Marico River, defeated him so
thoroughly that he fled north of the Limpopo and left
the country for ever. From the little we know of
him he was a cruel and treacherous chief, inferior in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
strength to Tchaka, as he was utterly inferior to
Moshesh in statesmanship. But the men he led had
the true Zulu fighting spirit, and in the Matabele,
under his son Lobengula, we have learned something
of the warriors of Mosilikatse.</p>

<p>A throne which, as with the Zulus and their offshoots,
had no strong religious sanction, must subsist
either by continued success in battle or a studious
statesmanship. Tchaka is an instance of the first;
Moshesh, the founder of the Basuto power, is a signal
example of the second. The Basutos were driven
down from the north by the Zulu advance, and found
shelter in the wild tangle of mountains which cradle
the infant Orange and Caledon rivers. Moshesh, who
had no hereditary claim to a throne, won his power
by his own abilities, and on the mountain of Thaba
Bosigo established his royal kraal. The name of the
&ldquo;Chief of the Mountain&rdquo; is written larger even than
Tchaka&rsquo;s over South African history, and to-day his
people are the only tribe who have any substantive
independence. Alone among native chiefs he showed
the intellect of a trained statesman, and a tireless
patience which is only too rare in the annals of statesmanship.
The presence of French missionaries at his
court gave him the means of instruction in European
ways, and he was far too clever to have any prejudice
against so startling a departure from the habits of his
race. He watched the dissensions of the rival white
peoples, and quietly and cautiously profited by their
blunders. He made war against them as a tactical
measure, and after an undoubted victory increased his
power by making a diplomatic peace. He left his
tribe riches and security, and the history of Basutoland
since his day is one long commentary on the
surprising talents of its founder. How far the credit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
is his and how far it belongs to his advisers we cannot
tell; but we can admire a character so liberal as to
accept advice, and a mind so shrewd that it saw unerringly
its own advantage. There is none of the
wild glamour of conquest about him, but there is a more
abiding reputation for a far more intricate
work; for, like another statesman, he could make
a small town a great city&mdash;and with the minimum
of expense.</p>

<p>With the death of Moshesh the history of South
Africa becomes almost exclusively the history of its
white masters. It is an old country, as old as time,
the prey of many conquerors, but with it all a patient
and mysterious land. Civilisations come and go, and
after a millennium or two come others who speculate
wildly on the relics of the old. In some future century
(who knows?), when the Rand is covered with thick
bush and once more the haunt of game, some enlightened
sportsman, hunting in his shirt after the
bush-veld manner, may clear the undergrowth from
the workings of the Main Reef and write a chapter
such as this on the doings of earlier adventurers.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h4>THE GENTLEMEN-ADVENTURERS.</h4>

<p>The world&rsquo;s changes, so philosophers have observed,
spring from small origins, though their reason and
their justification may be ample enough, and exercise
the learned for a thousand years. A sailor&rsquo;s tale, a
book in an old library, may set the adventurer off on
his voyages, and presently empires arise, and his
fatherland alters its history. The world moves to no
measured tune; everywhere there are sudden breaks,
paradoxes, high enterprises which end in smoke, and
pedestrian beginnings which issue in the imperial
purple. All things have their ground in theory, and
by-and-by a dismal post-mortem science will discover
impulses which the adventurer never dreamed of.
Few lands, even the most remote, are without this
variegated history, and the crudest commercial power
is built up on the <i>dibris</i> of romance. South Africa,
which is to-day, and to most men, a parvenu country,
founded on the Stock Exchange, has odd incidents in
her pedigree. Eliminate all the prehistoric guesses,
strike out the Dutch, and the Old World has still had
its share in her fashioning. Europe may seem only
yesterday to have finally sealed her conquest, but she
has been trying her hand at it for five hundred years.
And the result of the oldest struggle has been a
curious story of failure&mdash;often heroic, seldom wise, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
always fascinating, as such stories must be. It is
associated with one of the smallest, and to-day the
least enterprising, of European peoples; and it has
issued in Portugal&rsquo;s most notable over-sea possession.
Every nation has its holy land of endeavour&mdash;England
in India, France in Algiers, Russia in
Turkestan. Such was South Africa to Portugal;
much what Sicily was to the Athenians, the place
linked with all her hopes and with her direst misfortunes.</p>

<p>Happily the adventure was not without its
chroniclers. The Dominican friar, dos Santos,<a name="FNanchor_4_4"
id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> has
sketched for us the empire at its zenith, and de
Barros, the Portuguese Secretary for the Indies, has
piously narrated its beginnings. But the matter-of-fact
histories disguise the real daring of the exploit.
The chivalry of Europe in its most characteristic form
was carried 8000 miles from home to an unknown
land; civilisation of a kind, a Christian church, a code
of honour, the rudiments of law and commerce, and
the amenities of life, were planted on a narrow malarial
seaboard by men who had taken years in the voyage,
and had scarcely a hope of return. It is said that a
great part of courage lies in having done the thing
before, but there was no such ingredient in the valour
of those adventurers. Risking all on a dream, they
set off on their ten-year excursions, holding an almost
certain death as a fair stake in the game. The tenth
who survived set themselves cheerfully to transform
their discoveries into a national asset. They colonised
as whole-heartedly, if not as wisely, as any nation
in the world. And in spite of the narrowest and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
most pragmatic of cultures, they proved themselves
singularly adaptable. The Portuguese gentlemen, for
whom the Cancioneiros were sung, became Africans
in everything but blood, adopting a new land under
their old flag, and doing their best to Christianise and
colonise it. It was not their fault that the unalterable
laws of trade and the destinies of races shattered in
time the fabric at which they had laboured.</p>

<p>In 1445, the year in which Diniz Dias is reported to
have rounded Cape Verd, the Portuguese were the
most daring seamen in Europe. Dwelling on a promontory,
they naturally turned their eyes southward
and westward, when peace and a moderate wealth
gave them leisure for fancies. Those were the days
of the foreglow of the Renaissance. Constantinople
had not yet fallen, but the spirit of inquiry was
abroad, and a fresh wind had blown among scholastic
cobwebs. The Church had her share in the revival.
A belated missionary, or, as it may be, commercial,
zeal stirred the ecclesiastical powers. Fresh lands
might be won for the Cross, and fresh moneys to
build new abbeys and endow new bishoprics. The
merchants of Lisbon and Oporto saw gold in every
traveller&rsquo;s tale, and gladly risked a bark on a promising
undertaking. There lived, too, at the time a
sagacious prince, Henry the Navigator, the son of
Joco I. and Philippa of Lancaster, himself an amateur
of colonisation, who set the fashion for courtiers and
citizens. So the young Portuguese squire, trained in
the pride of his caste, his mind nurtured on chivalrous
tales, fired readily at the strange rumours, and found
a peaceful life among his vineyards no satisfying
career for a man. To him the white sea-wall of the
harbour was the boundary of the unknown. Out in
the west lay the Purple Islands of King Juba, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
forgotten Atlantis, the lost Hesperides, and dim
classical recollections from the monastery school gave
authority to his fancies. There were but two careers
for a gentleman, arms and adventure, and the latter
was for the moment the true magnet. To him it
might be given to find the Golden City, the Ophir of
King Solomon, or to penetrate beyond the deserts to
where Prester John<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a
href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> ruled his wild empire in the
fear of God. And all the while in Europe men were
wrangling over creeds and syllogisms, questioning the
powers of the Church, grumbling over dogmas, dying
for a few square miles of territory. What wonder if
to high-bred, high-spirited youth Europe seemed all
too narrow&mdash;especially to youth in that south-west
corner cut off by the sierras from the world? What
mattered desperate peril so long as it had daylight
and honour in it? So with hope at his prow and
a clear conscience the adventurer set out on his
travels.</p>

<p>The first object of Portuguese enterprise was Bilad
Ghana, the modern Senegal, which they knew of
from Arab geographers. The land route across the
Sahara was closed to them, so they were compelled to
reach it by sea. It was Henry&rsquo;s dream to make the
country a Portuguese dependency, and Christianise
it under the iron rule of the Order of the Knights
of Jesus Christ,&mdash;one of those schemes in which the
crusading spirit and a hunger for new territory are
subtly blended in the common fashion of the Age of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the Adventurers. It was currently believed that the
Senegal River rose from a lake near the source of the
Nile, and would thus enable the Portuguese to join
hands with the Christian monarch of Abyssinia. A
special indulgence was obtained from the Pope for all
who fought under the banner of the Order of Christ.
And so, blessed by the Church, a series of slave-raids
began, which were slowly pushed farther south till
Cape Verd was reached, and the great turn of the
coast to the east began to puzzle the sea-captains.
Henry died in 1460, having added, as he believed,
a vast territory to the Portuguese Crown, called by
the name of Guinea, which is Bilad Ghana corrupted.
That the future interests of its discoverer might be
properly cared for the new land was divided into
parishes, whose chaplains were bound to say one
weekly mass for the Iffante&rsquo;s soul. By the time of
the death of Affonso V. in 1481 the Portuguese had
passed the Niger Delta, discovered the island of
Fernando Po, and reached a point two degrees south
of the equator. In 1484 Diego Cam reached the
mouth of the Congo, and next year set up a marble
pillar at Cape Cross to mark his occupation. Another
year and Bartolomeo Diaz touched at Angra Pequena,
pushed round the Cape, keeping far out to sea, to
Algoa Bay; and on returning discovered that Cabo
Tormentoso which his king christened Cabo da
Boa Esperanza, the first earnest of the hope of the
new road to the Indies. Portugal had taken rank as
the first of seafaring powers, and, in Politian&rsquo;s words,
stood forth as &ldquo;the trustee of a second world, holding
in the hollow of her hand a vast series of lands,
ports, seas, and islands revealed by the industry of
her sons and the enterprise of her kings.&rdquo; Politian
asked that the great story might be written while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
materials were yet fresh, but unfortunately Portugal
was richer at that time in sea-captains than in men
of letters.</p>

<p>On July 8, 1497, Vasco da Gama, the greatest of
the world&rsquo;s sailors, left Lisbon on the greatest of all
voyages. The circumnavigation of Africa was imposed
upon the Archemenid Sataspes as a &ldquo;penalty
worse than death,&rdquo; but to those adventurers death
itself was an inconsiderable accident. Five years
before Columbus had made his first journey, an enterprise
not to be named in the same breath as da
Gama&rsquo;s. On Christmas day, having safely passed the
Cape, he came to a land of green, tree-clad shores,
which he piously christened Natal. He pushed on
past the Limpopo and the Zambesi delta to Mozambique,
where he found an Arab colony, and to Mombasa,
where the chief street still bears his name. He
reached Calicut safely on May 20, 1498, ten months
and twelve days after leaving Lisbon; and two years
later he returned home with one-third of the crew he
had sailed with. The Grand Road was now defined;
thenceforth it was a trade-route to which commerce
naturally turned. No more romantic voyages were
ever undertaken, for in those forlorn latitudes
Christian and Muslim, East and West, met in war
and peace, and creeds and ideas clashed in the
strangest disorder. In the expedition of 1500 under
Pedro Alvarez Cabral two men were set ashore at
Melinda, north of Mozambique, to look for Prester
John, and history is silent on the fate of the unfortunate
gentlemen. In da Gama&rsquo;s second voyage
Nilwa was captured and the Portuguese East African
empire began. A fierce enthusiast was this same
da Gama, for, meeting with a great ship of the
Sultan of Egypt, filled with Muslim pilgrims, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
looted it from stem to stern, and sent every pilgrim
to Paradise.</p>

<p>After da Gama came Affonso d&rsquo;Albuquerque, who
seized Goa, and established his country&rsquo;s hold on the
Malabar coast, and pushing on captured Malacca, the
richest of the Portuguese trading stations. He swept
all alien navies from the Eastern seas, and established
on a sound basis of naval supremacy a great commercial
empire. Nothing less than the conquest of
Turkey would satisfy him. He dreamed of allying
himself with Prester John, and establishing himself
on the Upper Nile; and again of raiding Medina,
carrying off Muhammad&rsquo;s coffin, and exchanging it
for the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. He captured
Hormuz on the Persian Gulf, and with it the enormous
trade between India and Asia Minor; and he was on
the eve of leading an expedition against Aden, which
he saw to be the key of the Red Sea, when he was
struck down at Goa, and died, like the great seigneur
he was, clothed in the robes of his knightly order.
Against his expressed wish he was buried at Goa, for
the Portuguese believed that, as long as the bones of
their intrepid leader lay there, their Empire of the
East would stand. So died the foremost of his
countrymen, one who may rank with Olive as the
greatest of Christian viceroys.</p>

<p>Meantime the East African power had been fully
established. Sofala and Mozambique, the chief cities
of the coast, had fallen to the Portuguese, and their
eyes turned to what they believed to be the fabulously
rich hinterlands, where Solomon had won his gold and
ivory, and Arab traders had for centuries found their
hunting-ground. The Monomotapa, the chief or
emperor of the Makalanga, whose Zimbabwe was
situated somewhere in what we now know as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Mashonaland, took the place of Prester John in their
imagination. They pushed up the Zambesi, founding
trading stations on the way, which still survive. They
found Ophir in every Bantu name, and began that long
series of meaningless wars of conquest which in the
end shattered their dream of empire. Gold-seeking
has never been an enterprise blessed of Heaven; and
the Portuguese were more unlucky than most adventurers.
They found themselves involved in desperate
wars; fever and poison carried off their leaders; and
the grandees, like Barreto and Homem, who in
cuirasses and velvets held indabas with Makalanga
chiefs, got little reward for their diplomacy. Soon
the horizon narrowed, boundaries were defined, and
the colonist sat down in the coast towns to make a
living by legitimate trade.</p>

<p>The chief commercial importance of South-East
Africa to the Portuguese was as a port of call on the
great trade-route to the Indies. The skins, ivory,
and gold, which the country produced, could never
vie with the organised exports of Goa and Calicut. So
Mozambique and Sofala became rather depots than
supply-grounds, at which the great ships anchored
and refitted; points of vantage, too, in the endless
bickerings with Arab traders. There was a modest
commerce with the interior, with Tete as the chief
depot, and Masapa, Luanze, and Bukoto as the up-country
stations. Each inland Portuguese trader was
also a diplomat. Through him the presents passed
from the Portuguese king to the savage &ldquo;emperors,&rdquo;
and, situated as he might be at Masapa, on the very
edge of the mountain Fura and the forbidden Makalanga
country, his duties were often most delicate and
hazardous. The trade as a whole was neither productive
nor well managed. The whole empire was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
undermanned. Portugal was colonising Brazil and
West Africa at the time she was sending out her
adventurers to the East, and the little kingdom in
Europe could not long endure the strain. The sons
she sent forth rarely returned; and the estates at
home fell out of cultivation for lack of men. Meantime
stronger and more fortunate races were appearing
in the Eastern waters. The Englishmen Newbery,
Candish, and Raymond began the rivalry, and the
formidable Dutch followed next, with their northern
vigour and commercial aptitudes. In 1595 the first
of Linschoten&rsquo;s books was published, and opened up
a new world for Dutch enterprise. The Dutch East
India Company soon wrested from Portugal her
Indian possessions, and in a little her East African
ports were mere isolated stations, much harassed
by the Netherland fleets, and the Grand Road had
become a thing of the past.</p>

<p>But, as commerce declined, a new epoch in the
Portuguese history began. The disappearance of
trade was followed by the advent of one of the
most heroic missionary brotherhoods in history. The
Jesuit Gonsalvo de Silveira was the pioneer, and
a year after he landed in Africa he was murdered
by the Makalanga chief. Some fifty years later the
Dominicans joined the Jesuits, and till the beginning
of the eighteenth century laboured at their quixotic
task. Now and then a chief&rsquo;s son was baptised and
attained to some degree of civilisation, but the mass
of the people, living among fierce tribal wars, cared
little for curious tales of peace. There was no ostentation
with those Bishops of This or That <i>in partibus
infidelium</i>. No churches remain to tell of their work.
They lived simply in huts, and died a thousand miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
away from their kin, so that their very names are
forgotten. In our own day travellers in the Zambesi
valley have come to kraals where the people called
themselves Christians, and showed a few perverted
rites in evidence, the one relic of those forgotten
heroes. A few incidents, however, have remained
in men&rsquo;s minds. Luiz do Espirito Santa, a prior of
Mozambique, on being taken into the presence of the
Monomotapa and ordered to make obeisance, stiffened
his back, and replied that he did such homage to God
alone; for which noble saying he was duly murdered.
The Shining Cross, which Constantine saw, appeared
also to the friar Manoel Sardinha when he led his forces
against the Makalanga. In 1652 the Monomotapa
Manuza was received into the Church, an event which
was the occasion for a great thanksgiving service at
Lisbon, at which the king Joco IV. attended in state.
His son, Miguel, entered the Dominican order, was
given the diploma of Master of Theology, and died
a vicar of the convent of Santa Barbara in Goa.
This barbarian Charles V., the greatest South African
chief of his time, may well be remembered among
the few mortals who have voluntarily renounced a
crown.</p>

<p>And so the empire, having shipwrecked on a dream
of gold and a land where men could not live,<a name="FNanchor_6_6"
id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> dwindled
down to isolated forts and stations, and the strenuous
creed of the pioneers was softened into the bastard
contentment of the disheartened. Miserably and corruptly
governed, forgotten by Europe, they forgot
Europe in turn, and a strange somnolent life began of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
half-barbaric, wholly oriental seigneurs, ruling as petty
monarchs over natives from whom they were not
wholly distinct.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a
href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Instead of holding the outposts of
European culture, they sank themselves into the ways
of the soil which their forefathers had conquered.
Round Tete and Inhambane and Sofala there grew up
great country estates, held on a kind of feudal tenure,
where the slack-mouthed grandee idled away his days.
Set among acres of orchards and gardens, those dwellings
were often noble and sumptuous. Thither came
belated travellers, gold-seekers, shipwrecked seamen,
wandering friars, men of every nationality and trade,
and in the prazo of a de Mattos or a de Mira found
something better than the mealie-pap they had been
living on in native kraals. Sitting on soft couches,
drinking good Madeira, and looking at a copy of
a Murillo or a Velasquez on the walls, they may well
have extolled those oases in the desert. The grandee
had his harem, like any Arab sheikh; he dispensed
death cruelly and casually among his subjects; but as
a rule he seems to have had the virtue of hospitality,
and welcomed gladly any traveller with tales of the
forgotten world. Fierce Bantu wars have left few
traces of those pleasant demesnes; but to the new-comer
the land where they once existed has still a quaint
air of decadent civilisation. Coming down from the
high tableland of the interior, which is the most
strenuous land on earth, through the mountain glens
which, but for vegetation, might be Norway, one
enters a country of bush and full muddy rivers, a
country of dull lifeless green and a pestilent climate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
But as one draws nearer the coast, where glimpses of
gardens appear and white-walled estancias, and rivers
spread into lagoons with spits of yellow sand and Arab
boatmen, and, last of all, the pale blue Indian Ocean
stretches its sleepy leagues to the horizon, there comes
a new feeling into the scene, as of something old, not
new, decaying rather than undeveloped, which, joined
with the moist heat, makes the place</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">&ldquo;A land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which it seemhd always afternoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All round the coast the languid air did swoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathing like one that hath a weary dream.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The tale of this empire, crude and melancholy as it
is, provides an instructive commentary on current
theories of colonisation. From Tyre and Sidon down
to the last Teutonic performance, there is surely sufficient
basis to generalise on; but no two theorists are
agreed upon the laws which govern those racial adventures.
The only approach to a dogma is the theory
that to colonise is to decentralise&mdash;that before a vigorous
life can begin over-sea the runners must be cut
which bind the colony to the homeland. France fails,
we say, because a Frenchman away from home cannot
keep his mind off the boulevards; he is for ever an
exile, not a settler. Britain succeeds because her sons
find a land of their adoption. But the converse is
equally important, though too rare in its application
to be often remembered. No race can colonise which
cannot decentralise its energy; but equally no race
can colonise which can wholly decentralise its sentiment
and memory. Portugal failed for this reason
chiefly, that the Portuguese forgot Portugal. Few
peoples have been so adaptable. The white man&rsquo;s
pride died in their hearts. They were ready to mix
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
with natives on equal terms.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a
href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Now concubinage is
bad, but legitimate marriage with half-castes is infinitely
worse for the <em>morale</em> of a people. And since
Nature to the end of time has a care of races but
not of hybrids, this tolerant, foolish, unstable folk
dropped out of the battle-line of life, and sank from
conquerors to resident aliens, while their country
passed from an empire to a vague seaboard. &ldquo;A
people scattered by their wars and affairs over the
whole earth, and home-sick to a man,&rdquo; wrote Emerson
of the English, and it is the trait of the true colonist.
It is as important to remember &ldquo;sweet Argos&rdquo; as it is
to avoid a womanish <i>heimweh</i>. For a colony is a sapling,
bound by the law of nature to follow the development
of the parent tree. A parcel of Englishmen
on the Australian coast have no significance without
England at their back, to give them a tradition of
manners and government, to be their recruiting-ground,
to hold out at once a memory of home and an ideal of
polity. Wars of separation may come, but a colony is
still a colony: it may have a different colour on the
map, but its moral complexion is the same; politically
it may be a rival, spiritually it remains a daughter.</p>

<p>The country, too, was wretchedly governed. The
Portuguese viceroy, often some impoverished noble,
was in the same position as the Roman proconsul, and
had to restore his fortunes at the expense of the provincials.
Local administration was farmed out to local
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
magnates, another part of the crazy decentralisation
which led to catastrophe. There is more in bad government
than hardship for the private citizen. It means
the weakening of the intellectual and moral nerve of
the race which tolerates it. Sound government is not,
as revolutionary doctrinaires used to think, the outcome
of the grace of God and a flawless code of abstractions.
It means a perpetual effort, a keen sense of
reality, a constant facing and adjusting of problems.
And it is one of the laws of life that this high faculty
is inconsistent with extreme luxury and ease. A great
governor may be one-fourth voluptuary, but he must
be three-parts politician. &ldquo;Je n&rsquo;aime pas beaucoup
les femmes,&rdquo; was one of Napoleon&rsquo;s self-criticisms,
&ldquo;ni le jeu&mdash;enfin rien; je suis tout ` fait un jtre
politique.&rdquo; The thin strain of old-world tradition
was useless in men who were sheikhs, adventurers,
grandees, but never statesmen.</p>

<p>But the ultimate source of weakness was economic.
The settlements were unproductive in any real sense.
The empire was a chain of forts and depots, and on no
side was the ruling power organically connected with
the soil. A colony should be built up of farmers and
miners and manufacturers, having for its basis the
productive energy of the land. To exploit is not to
colonise, and on this side there is the most urgent need
for decentralisation. The Portuguese lost their European
culture, but they remained adventurers and
aliens. Their traders bargained for produce, but they
never went to the root of the matter and organised
production. They had no ranches or plantations, only
their trading-booths. Like the Carthaginians, they
carried their commerce to the ends of the earth, and
left the ends of the earth radically unaffected by their
presence. People repeat glibly that trade follows the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
flag, and that commerce is the basis of empire. And
in a sense it is true, for an empire without commercial
inter-relations and a solid basis of material prosperity
is a house built on the sand. But if the maxim be
taken in the sense that commerce is in itself a sufficient
imperial bond, it is the most fatal of heresies. The
Dutch, in their heyday, had an empire chiefly of forts
and factories; and what part has the Dutch empire
played in the destinies of mankind? No race or kingdom
can endure which is not rooted in the soil, drawing
sustenance from natural forces, increasing by tillage
and forestry, pasturage and mining and manufacture,
the aggregate of the world&rsquo;s production. And the
need is as much moral as economic. The trader pure
and simple&mdash;Tyrian, Greek, Venetian, Dutch, or
Portuguese&mdash;is too cosmopolitan and adventitious to be
the staple of a strong race. He has not the common
local affections; he is not knit close enough to nature
in his toil. To wrest a living from the avarice of the
earth is to form character with the salt and iron of
power in it. India, it is true, is a partial exception;
but India is a unique case of a long-settled subject
people ruled wisely by a race which has sufficient
breadth and vitality in its culture to spare time for the
experiment. It is to colonies, which must always form
the major part of an empire, that the maxim applies;
for the former is a native power under tutelage, while
the latter is the expansion of the parent country beyond
the seas. And this expansion must be more than commercial.
The colony must be founded in the soil, its
people with each generation becoming more indigenous,
and its wealth based on its own toil and enterprise;
otherwise it is but such a chain of factories as the
Portuguese established, which the proverbial whiff of
grape-shot may scatter to-morrow.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h4>THE GREAT TREK.</h4>

<p>Every race has its Marathon into which the historian
does not inquire too closely who has a reverence for
holy places and a fear of sacrilege. It may be a battle
or a crusade, a creed, or perhaps only a poem, but whatever
it is, it is part and parcel of the national life, and
it is impossible to reach the naked truth through the
rose-coloured mists of pious tradition. A Sempach or
a Bannockburn cannot be explained by a bare technical
history. The spirit of a nation was in arms, the
national spirit was the conqueror, and the combatants
appear more than mere flesh and blood, walking
&ldquo;larger than human&rdquo; on the hills of story. This
phenomenon has merits which it is hard to exaggerate.
It is the basis for the rhetorical self-confidence which
is essential to a strong race. It is a fountain from
which generous youth can draw inspiration, an old
watchword to call the inert to battle. If the race has
a literature, it helps to determine its character; if the
race has none, it provides a basis for fireside tales.
The feeblest Greek at the court of Artaxerxes must
have now and then straightened himself when he
remembered Salamis. Without such a retrospect a
people will live in a crude present, and, having no
buttress from the past, will fare badly from the rough
winds of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
To the Boer the Great Trek is the unrecorded but
ever-remembered Odyssey of his people. He has a
long memory, perhaps because of his very slowness
and meagreness of fancy. His life was so monotonous
that the tale of how his fathers first came into the
land inspired him by its unlikeness to his own somnolent
traditions. Besides, he had a Scriptural parallel.
The persecuted children of Israel, in spite of the opposition
of Pharaoh, had fled across the desert from
Egypt and found a Promised Land. The Boer sense
of analogy is extremely vivid and extremely inexact.
Here he saw a perfect precedent. A God-fearing
people, leaving their homes doubtless at the call of the
Most High, had fled into the wilds of Amalek and
Edom, conquered and dispossessed the Canaanites, and
occupied a land which, if not flowing with milk and
honey, was at least well grassed and plentifully
watered. How keen the sense of Scriptural example
was, and how constantly present to the Boer mind
was the thought that he was following in the footsteps
of Israel, is shown by one curious story. The
voortrekkers, pushing out from Pretoria, struck a
stream which flowed due north, the first large north-running
water they had met. Moreover, it was liable
to droughts and floods recurring at fixed seasons.
What could it be but the great river of Egypt? So
with immense pious satisfaction they recognised it
as the Nile, and the Nyl it remains to this day.</p>

<p>The thought of a national exodus comes easily to
the Aryan mind,&mdash;an inheritance from primeval Asian
wanderings. And in itself it is something peculiarly
bold and romantic, requiring a renunciation of old ties
and sentiments impossible to an over-domesticated
race. It requires courage of a high order and a confident
faith in destiny. Perhaps the courage needed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
in the case of the Great Trek was less than in most
similar undertakings, because of the cheering Scriptural
precedent and the lack of that imagination which
can vividly forecast the future. The past history of
the Boer, too, prepared him for desperate enterprises.
Made up originally of doubtful adventurers from Holland,
hardihood grew up in their blood as they pushed
northwards from the seacoast. The people of the
littoral might be, as Lady Anne Barnard found them,
sluggish and spiritless; but the farmers of Colesberg
and Graaff-Reinet were in the nature of things a different
breed. The true Dutch blood does not readily
produce an adventurer, but it was leavened and sublimated
by a French Huguenot strain, scions of good
families exiled for the most heroic of causes. The
coarse strong Dutch stock swallowed them up; the language
disappeared, the Colberts became Grobelaars, the
Villons Viljoens, the Pinards Pienaars; but something
remained of <i>ilan</i> and spiritual exaltation. Harassed
from the north by Griqua and Hottentot bandits, and
from the east by Kaffir incursions, they became a hardy
border race, keeping their own by dint of a strong
arm. The quiet of the great sun-washed spaces entered
into their souls. They grew taciturn, ungraceful, profoundly
attached to certain sombre dogmas, impatient
of argument or restraint, bad citizens for any modern
State, but not without a gnarled magnificence of their
own. They were out of line with the whole world,
far nearer in kinship to an Old Testament patriarch
than to the townsfolk with whom they shared the
country. All angles and corners, they presented an
admirable front to savage nature; but they were
hard to dovetail into a complex modern society.
They would have made good Ironsides, and would
have formed a stubborn left wing at Armageddon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
but they did ill with franchises and taxes and
paternal legislation.</p>

<p>I will take two savage tales from their history to
show what manner of men they were in extremity.
A certain Frederick Bezuidenhout, a farmer in the
Bruintje Hoogte, and by all accounts a dabbler in
less reputable trades, was summoned on some charge
before the landdrost of the district, and declined to
appear. A warrant was issued for his apprehension,
and a party of soldiers sent out to enforce it, whereupon
Bezuidenhout took refuge in a cave, and was shot dead
in its defence. The fiery cross went round among his
relatives; overtures, which were refused, were made
to the Kaffir chiefs, and Jan Bezuidenhout, the brother
of the dead man, swore to fealty a band of as pretty
outlaws as ever dwelt on a border. The insurrection
failed; thirty-nine of the insurgents were captured,
and five were hanged, and Jan Bezuidenhout himself
was shot in the Kaffir country by an advance party of
the pursuit. Such is the too famous story of Slachter&rsquo;s
Nek. The tale of Conrad de Buys<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a
href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and his doings is
wilder but more obscure. A man of great physical
strength and the worst character, he was the leader of
the sterner desperadoes on the Kaffir border. Through
living much in native kraals he had become little
better than a savage. He was mixed up in Van
Jaarsveld&rsquo;s insurrection, and by-and-by his private
crimes exceeded his political by so much that he was
compelled to flee into the northern wilds. This first
of the voortrekkers is next heard of on the banks of
the Limpopo, living in pure barbarism, with a harem
of Kaffir wives and an immense prestige among his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
neighbours. The emigrant party under Potgieter,
on their return from Delagoa Bay, found somewhere
in the Lydenburg hills two half-breeds who
called this ruffian father and acted as interpreters.
Conrad peopled the Transvaal with his
children, whom he seems to have ruled in a patriarchal
fashion, forming a real Buys clan, who still hang
together at Marah, in Zoutpansberg. In the Pietersburg
Burgher camp during the war there was a Buys
location, who strenuously urged their claim to be considered
a white people and burghers of the republic.</p>

<p>Such was one element in the race of border farmers&mdash;a
substratum of desperate lawlessness. But there
were other elements, many of them noble and worthy.
Their morals were less bad than peculiar; their lawlessness
rather an inability to understand restrictions
than an impulse to disorder. They had their own
staunch loyalties, their own strict code of honour.
They had the self-confidence of a people whose
dogmatic foundations are unshaken, and who are in
habitual intercourse with an inferior race. In a rude
way they were kindly and hospitable. They had a
courage so unwavering that it may be called an
instinct, and the bodily strength which comes from
bare living and constant exertion. &ldquo;Simple&rdquo; and
&ldquo;pastoral&rdquo; used to be words of praise. During the
late war they became a sneer; but it is well to
recognise that while they may comprise the gravest
faults they must denote a few sterling virtues.</p>

<p>When Pieter Retief left Graaff-Reinet in 1837, he
issued an ingenious proclamation which contains his
justification of the Great Trek. He complains of the
unnecessary hardships attending the emancipation of
the slaves, the insecurity of life and property caused
by the absence of proper vagrancy laws, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
disaster certain to attend Lord Glenelg&rsquo;s reversal of
British policy on the Kaffir border. Retief was a
man of high and conscientious character, and his
profession of faith is valuable as showing the view of
current politics held by the better class of the voortrekkers.
They did not defend slavery&mdash;Retief expressly
repudiates it; but they objected to the method
of its abolition, and the lack of precautions for future
public safety which the event demanded. Lord Glenelg&rsquo;s
withdrawal from the eastern border to the
boundary of the Keiskama and Tyumie rivers, as
fixed by Lord Charles Somerset in 1819, appeared to
them a flagrant piece of weakness which sooner or
later must make life on that border impossible. They
saw no hope of redress from the imperial Government,
which seemed to be dominated by philanthropic
hysteria. It is a grave indictment, and worth examination.
The slavery question stands in the foreground.
The ocean slave-trade was suppressed in
1807, and the English abolitionists had leisure to turn
their minds to South Africa. The first progressive
enactment came in 1816, when the registration of
slaves and slave-births was made compulsory in
every district. In 1823 a series of laws were passed
restricting slave labour on the Sabbath, giving
slaves the right of owning property, and limiting
the punishments to which they were liable. In
1826 officials were appointed in country districts to
watch over slave interests, and see that the protective
enactments were carried out. The famous Fiftieth
Ordinance of 1828 gave the Hottentots the same legal
rights as the white colonists. Meanwhile for years a
great missionary agitation for total abolition had been
going on, which was powerfully supported by the
Whig party in England. The Dutch saw clearly the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
trend of events, and, in what is known as the &ldquo;Graaff-Reinet
proposals,&rdquo; attempted to procure gradually the
emancipation which they realised was bound to come.
They proposed, unanimously, that after a date to be
fixed by Government all female children should be
free at birth, and, by a majority, that all male children
born after the same date should also be free. I cannot
find in these proposals the insidious attempt to defeat
the movement which some writers have discerned:
they seem to me to be as fair and reasonable an offer
as we could expect a slave-holding class to make.
But the British attitude is also perfectly clear. Slave-holding
had been condemned as a crime by the national
conscience, and there could be no temporising with
the evil thing. Here, again, a certain kind of education
was necessary to appreciate the point of view.
The farmers of Graaff-Reinet had not listened to the
harangues of Wilberforce and Fowell Buxton; Zion
Chapel and its all-pervading atmosphere of mild
brotherly love were not within the compass of their
experience. England was right, as she generally is in
policies which are inspired by a profound popular conviction;
but she could hardly expect men of a very
different training to fall in readily with her views. In
any case the working out of the policy was attended
by many blunders. The Emancipation Act took effect
in Cape Colony from the 1st of December 1834.
#1,200,000 seems a rather inadequate compensation
for 35,000 slaves, and as each claim had to be presented
before commissioners in London, the farmer
had perforce to employ an agent, who bought up his
claims at a discount of anything from 18 to 30 per
cent.</p>

<p>The losses from emancipation were chiefly felt in
the rich agricultural districts of the colony, such as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Stellenbosch, Ceres, and Worcester; the border farmers
were not a large slave-owning class, and the lack
of cheap labour did not trouble them. But emancipation
meant a general dislocation of credit all over the
country. A man who in 1833 was counted a rich
man was comparatively poor in 1835, and this <i>peripeteia</i>
had a bad effect on the whole farming class.
It was rather the spirit of the Act which the Boers
of Graaff-Reinet complained of,&mdash;the theory, to them
ridiculous, that the black man could have legal rights
comparable with the white, and the sense of insecurity
which dwellers under such a <i>rigime</i> must feel. The
average Boer was an arbitrary but not an unkind slave-master;
he regarded his slaves as part of his <i>familia</i>,
an enclosure to which the common law should not penetrate.
To be limited by statute in the use of what
he considered his chattels, to find hundreds of officious
gentlemen ready to take the part of the chattels on
any occasion against him, were pills too bitter to
swallow. Emancipation produced vagrants, and he
asked for a stringent vagrancy law which his landrosts
could administer. England, refusing naturally
to take away with one hand what she had given with
the other, declined to expose the emancipated slave to
the arbitrariness of local tribunals. Well, argued the
farmers, our slaves, being free, have become rogues
and vagabonds; they may plunder us at their pleasure
and England will take their part: it is time for us to
seek easier latitudes.</p>

<p>But the chief factor in Dutch dissatisfaction was
undoubtedly Lord Glenelg&rsquo;s limitation of the eastern
border line. There is something to be said for the
view of that discredited, and, to tell the truth, not
very wise statesman. The Boer was a bad neighbour
for a Kaffir people. He was always encroaching,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
spurred on by that nomadic something in his blood&mdash;a
true Campbell of Breadalbane, who built his house
on the limits of his estate that he might &ldquo;brise yont.&rdquo;
A buffer state was apt to become very soon a Boer
territory. Better to try and establish a strong Kaffir
people, who might attain to some semblance of national
life, and under the maternal eye of Britain become useful
and progressive citizens. So reasoned Lord Glenelg and
his advisers, missionary and official. Unfortunately
facts were against him, the chimera of a Kaffir nation
was soon dispelled, and ten years later Sir Harry Smith,
a governor who did not suffer from illusions, made the
eastern province a Kaffir reserve under a British
commissioner. The frontier Boer, however, was not
in a position to share any sentiment about a Kaffir
nation. He saw his cattle looted, his family compelled
to leave their newly acquired farm, and a long prospect
of Kaffir raids where the presumption of guilt
would always be held to lie against his own worthy
self. Above all things he saw a barred door. No
more &ldquo;brising yont&rdquo; for him on the eastern border.
Expansion, space, were as the breath of his nostrils,
and if he could not have them in the old colony he
would seek them in the untravelled northern wilds.</p>

<p>There were thus certain well-defined reasons for the
Great Trek in contemporary politics which, combined
with distorted memories like Slachter&rsquo;s Nek, made
up in Boer eyes a very complete indictment against
Pharaoh and his counsellors. But the real reason lay
in his blood. Had the British Government been all
that he could desire, he would still have gone. He
was a wanderer from his birth, and trekking, even for
great distances, was an incident of his common life.
A pastoral people have few vested interests in land.
There are no ancient homesteads to leave, or carefully-tended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
gardens or rich corn-lands. Their wealth is
in their herds, which can be driven at will to other
pastures. The Boer rarely built much of a farm, and
he never fenced. A cottage, a small vegetable-yard,
and a stable made up the homestead on even large
farms on the border. There was nothing to leave
when he had gathered his horned cattle into a mob,
yoked his best team to his waggon, and stowed his
rude furniture inside. With his rifle slung on his
shoulder, he was as free to take the road as any
gipsy. He was leaving the country of the alien,
where mad fancies held sway and unjust laws and
taxes oppressed him. He was bound for the far
lands of travellers&rsquo; tales, the country of rich grass
and endless game, where he could live as he pleased
and preserve the fashions of his fathers unchanged. He
would meet with fierce tribes, but his elephant-gun,
as he knew from experience, was a match for many
assegais. There was much heroism in the Great Trek,
but there was also for the young and hale an exhilarating
element of sport. To them it was a new,
strange, and audacious adventure. No predikant
accompanied the emigrants. The Kirk did not see
the Scriptural parallel, and to a man preferred the
treasure in Egypt to the doubtful fortunes of Israel.</p>

<p>The first party consisted of about thirty waggons,
under the leadership of Louis Trichard and Jan van
Rensburg. They travelled slowly, the men hunting
along the route, and outspanned for days, and even
weeks, at pleasant watering-places. The main object
of those pioneers was to ascertain the road to Delagoa
Bay; so they did not seek land for settlement, but
pushed on till they came to Piet Potgieter&rsquo;s Rust, a
hundred miles or so north of Pretoria, which they
thought to be about the proper latitude. Here the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
party divided. Van Rensburg and his men went due
east into the wild Lydenburg country on their way to
the coast, and were never heard of again. Trichard
waited a little, and then slowly groped his way
through the Drakensberg to Portuguese territory.
The band suffered terribly from fever; their herds
were annihilated by the tsetse fly, of which they now
heard for the first time; but in the end about twenty-six
survivors struggled down to the bay and took
ship for Natal. So ended the adventure of the path-finders.
The next expedition was led by the famous
Andries Potgieter, and came from the Tarka and
Colesberg districts. The little Paulus Kruger, a boy
of ten, travelled with the waggons to the country
which he was to rule for long. Potgieter settled first
in the neighbourhood of Thaba &rsquo;Nchu on the Basuto
border, and bought a large tract of land from a
Bataung chief. Farms were marked out, and a few
emigrants remained, but the majority pushed on to
the north and east. Some crossed the Vaal, and
finding a full clear stream coming down from the
north, christened it the Mooi or Fair River; and
here in after-days, faithful to their first impression,
they planted the old capital of the Transvaal. Potgieter
with a small band set off on the search for
Delagoa Bay, but he seems to have lost himself in
the mountains between Lydenburg and Zoutpansberg.
On his return he found that Mosilikatse&rsquo;s warriors had
at last given notice of their presence, and had massacred
a number of small outlying settlements. So
began one of the sternest struggles in South African
history.</p>

<p>Potgieter gathered all the survivors into a great
laager at a place called Vechtkop, between the
Rhenoster and Wilge rivers. The precaution was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
taken none too soon, for one morning a few days
later a huge native army appeared, led by the chief
induna of Mosilikatse. The odds, so far as can be
gathered, were about a hundred to one, but the little
band was undaunted, and Sarel Celliers, a true Cromwellian
devotee of the Bible and the sword, called his
men to prayer. Then forty farmers rode out from the
laager, galloped within range, spread out and fired a
volley, riding back swiftly to reload. They did good
execution, but forty men, however bold, cannot disperse
5000, and in a little the Matabele were round
the laager, and the siege began. The defence was so
vigorous that after heavy losses the enemy withdrew,
driving with them the little stock which formed the
sole wealth of the emigrants.</p>

<p>The glove had been thrown down and there could be
no retreat. Midian must be destroyed root and branch
before Israel could possess the land. After a short rest
Potgieter and Gerrit Maritz began the war of reprisals.
With a commando of over 100 men and a
few Griqua followers, they forded the Vaal, crossed
the Magaliesberg, and arrived at Mosilikatse&rsquo;s chief
kraal at Mosega. The farmers&rsquo; victory was complete.
Over 400 of the Matabele were slain, several thousand
head of cattle secured, and the kraal given to the
flames. Potgieter returned to found the little town
of Winburg in memory of his victory, and, with the
assistance of Pieter Retief, to frame a constitution for
the nascent state. But Mosilikatse still remained.
He had not been present at the <i>debbcle</i> of Mosega,
and while he remained on the frontier there was no
security for life and property. New recruits had
come up from the south, including the redoubtable
family of Uys, the horses were in good condition, all
had had a breathing-space; so a new and more formidable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
expedition started in search of the enemy.
They found him on the Marico, and for nine days
fought with him on the old plan of a charge, a volley,
and a retreat. Then one morning there was no enemy
to fight; a cloud of dust to the north showed the line
of his flight; Mosilikatse had retired across the Limpopo.
Whereupon the emigrants proclaimed the whole
of the late Matabele territory&mdash;the Transvaal, the
Orange River Colony, and a portion of Bechuanaland&mdash;as
theirs by the right of conquest.</p>

<p>So runs the tale of the Great Trek,&mdash;rather an Iliad
than an Odyssey, perhaps, and a very bloodthirsty
Iliad, too. To most men it must seem a noble and
spirited story. Whatever the justice of the emigrants&rsquo;
grievances, they conducted themselves well in their
self-imposed exile. Potgieter and his men were indeed
rather exceptional specimens of their race, and they
were strung to the highest pitch by Christian faith
and the unchristian passion of revenge. They relapsed,
when all was over, to a somewhat ordinary type of
farmer, which seems to bear out the general conception
of the Boer character&mdash;that, while it is capable
of high deeds, it is powerful by sudden effort rather
than by sustained and strenuous toil. The experiment
which began so well should have ended in something
better than two bourgeois republics. There are some
who see in the tale nothing more than an unwarranted
invasion of native territory, and a cruel
massacre of a brave race. No view could be more
unjust. The Matabele had not a scrap of title to the
country, and had not dwelt in it more than a few
years. The real owners, if you can talk of ownership
at all, were the unfortunate Bataungs and Barolongs,
whom the emigrants befriended. The Matabele were
indeed as murderous a race of savages as ever lived, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
their defeat was a moral as well as a political necessity.
It is well to protect the aborigine, but when he is
armed with a dozen assegais and earnestly desires
your blood, it is safer to shoot him or drive him
farther afield. That the Boers were guilty of atrocities
in those fierce wars is undoubted, and, if some
tales be true, unpardonable. But there are excuses
to be made. When a man has seen his child writhing
on a spear and his wife mutilated; when he reflects
that he stands alone against impossible odds, and has
a keen sense, too, of Scriptural parallels,&mdash;he may be
forgiven if he slays and spares not, and even gives
way to curious cruelties. Revenge and despair may
play odd pranks with the best men: <i>tout comprendre
c&rsquo;est tout pardonner</i>.</p>

<p>What, then, is the proper view to take of this footnote
to the world&rsquo;s history, this Marathon of an unimaginative
race? It is possible to see in it only an
attempt of a half-savage people to find elbow-room for
their misdeeds. The voortrekkers, it has been said,
fled the approach of a mild and enlightened modern
policy, invaded a land which was not theirs, slaughtered
a people who had every right to resist them,
and created for themselves space to practise their
tyranny over the native, and perpetuate their exploded
religious and political creed in a retrograde society.
It is easy to say this, as it is easy to explain the
doings of the Pilgrim Fathers as a flight from a too
liberal and tolerant land to wilds where intolerance
could rule unchecked. With the best will in the
world to scrutinise Dutch legends, the Great Trek
seems to me just that legend which can well support
any scrutiny. For it was first and foremost a conflict
between civilisations. There were strong and worthy
men among the voortrekkers, as there were estimable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
people among their opponents. The modern political
creed, based on English constitutionalism, stray doctrines
of the French Revolution, and certain economic
maxims from Bentham and Adam Smith, is, in spite
of minor differences, common to the civilised world.
This was the creed which was forced upon the Border
Dutch, and, having received no education in the
axioms on which it was based, they unhesitatingly
rejected it, and clung to their old Scriptural feudalism.
When two creeds come into conflict, the older
and weaker usually goes under. But in this case the
men on the losing side were of a peculiar temper and
dwelt in a peculiar country. They took the bold path
of carrying themselves and their creed to a new land,
and so extended its lease of life for the better part of
a century. Let us take the parallel of the American
Civil War. The North fought for the cause of the
larger civic organism and certain social reforms which
were accidentally linked to it. The South stood for
the principle of nationality, and for certain traditions
of their own particular nationality. Roughly speaking,
it was the same conflict; but the Southern creed
perished because there was no practicable hinterland
to which it could be transplanted. Had there been, I
do not think its most stubborn opponents would have
denied admiration to so bold an endeavour to preserve
a national faith.</p>

<p>The Great Trek set its seal upon the new countries.
The Orange River Colony and the Transvaal are still
in the rural places an emigrant&rsquo;s land. The farmhouse
is the unit; the country dorps are merely
jumbles of little shanties to supply the farmers&rsquo; wants.
The place-names, with the endless recurrence of simple
descriptive epithets like Sterkstroom or Klipfontein,
or expressions of feeling like Nooitgedacht or Welgevonden,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
still tell the tale of the first discoverers.
There is no obscurity in the nomenclature, such as
is found in an old land where history has had time
to be forgotten. Any farm-boy will tell you how this
river came to be named the Ox-Yoke or that hill the
Place of Weeping. It has made the people a solemn,
ungenial folk, calculating and thrifty in their ways,
and given to living in hovels which suggest that here
they have no continuing city. Perhaps, as has been
said, no performance, however stupendous, is worth
loss of geniality; and the finer graces of life have
never had a chance on the veld. There is gipsy blood
in their veins, undying vagabondage behind all their
sleepy contentment. The quiet of the old waggon
journeys, when men counted the days on a notched
stick that they might not miss the still deeper quiet of
the Sabbaths, has gone into the soul of a race which
still above all things desires space and leisure. It is
this gipsy endowment which made them born warriors
after a fashion; it is this which gives them that
apathy in the face of war losses which discomfits their
sentimental partisans. Britain in her day has won
many strange peoples to her Empire; but none, I
think, more curious or more hopeful than the stubborn
children of Uys and Potgieter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h4>THE BOER IN SPORT.</h4>

<p>It is a fair working rule of life that the behaviour of a
man in his sports is a good index to his character in
graver matters. With certain reservations the same
holds true of a people. For on the lowest interpretation
of the word &ldquo;sport,&rdquo; the high qualities of courage,
honour, and self-control are part of the essential equipment,
and the mode in which such qualities appear is
a reflex of the idiosyncrasies of national character.
But this is true mainly of the old settled peoples,
whose sports have long lost the grim reality in which
they started. To a race which wages daily war with
savage nature the refinements of conduct are unintelligible;
sport becomes business; and unless there is a
hereditary tradition in the matter the fine manners of
the true hunter&rsquo;s craft are notable by their absence.</p>

<p>It is worth while considering the Boer in sport, for
it is there he is seen at his worst. Without tradition
of fair play, soured and harassed by want and disaster,
his sport became a matter of commerce, and he held
no device unworthy in the game. He hunted for the
pot, and the pot cast its shadow over all his doings.
His arms were rarely in the old days weapons of precision,
and we can scarcely expect much etiquette in
the pursuit of elephant or lion in a bush country with
a smooth-bore gun which had a quaint trajectory and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
a propensity to burst. The barbarous ways which he
learned in those wild games he naturally carried into
easier sports. Let us admit, too, that the Boer race
has produced a few daring and indefatigable hunters,
who, though rarely of the class of a Selous or a Hartley,
were yet in every way worthy of the name of sportsmen.
I have talked with old Boers from the hunting-veld,
and in their tales of their lost youth there
was a fervour which the commercial results of their
expeditions did not explain. But the fact remains
that to an Englishman the Boers, with a few exceptions,
are not a sporting race&mdash;they are not even a race
of very skilful hunters. They came to the land when
game was abundant and they thinned it out; but the
manner of this thinning was as prosaic as the routine
of their daily lives.</p>

<p>One advantage the Boer possessed in common with
all dwellers in new lands&mdash;he was familiar from childhood
with gun and saddle, and had to face the world
on his own legs from his early boyhood. In this way
he acquired what one might call the psychological
equipment of the hunter. Any one who has hunted in
wild countries will remember the first sense of strangeness,
the feeling that civilisation had got too far away
for comfort, which is far more eerie than common
nervousness. To this feeling the Boer was an utter
stranger. It was as natural for him to set a trap for
a lion before returning at nightfall, or to go off to the
hunting-veld for four winter months, as it was to sow
in spring and reap in autumn. And because it was an
incident of his common life he imported into it a
ridiculous degree of domesticity. On his farm he shot
for the pot; on his winter treks with stock to the
bush-veld and the wilder hunting expeditions for skins
and horns he carried his wife and family in his buck-waggon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
built himself a hut in the wilds, and reproduced
exactly the life of the farm. It was easy to
reproduce anywhere, for it was simplicity itself.
Mealie-meal, coffee, and some coarse tobacco were his
supplies, and fresh meat when game fell to his gun.
So it is not to be wondered at if hunting became to
him something wholly destitute of romance and adventure,
an affair like kirk and market, where business
was the beginning and the end.</p>

<p>But besides the Boer who farmed first and hunted
afterwards, there was the Boer who hunted by profession.
The class is almost extinct, but in outlying
farms one may still meet the old hunter and listen
to his incredible tales. Some were men of the first
calibre, the pioneers of a dozen districts, men of profound
gravity and placid temper, who rarely told the
tale of their deeds. But the common hunter is above
all things a talker. Like the Kaffir, he brags incessantly,
and a little flattery will lead him into wild
depths. He lies to the stranger, because he cannot be
contradicted; he lies to his friends, because they are
connoisseurs in the art and can appreciate the work of
a master. Boer hunting tales, therefore, should be
received with extreme caution. They would often
puzzle an expert lawyer, for they are full of minute
and fallacious particulars, skilfully put together, and
forming as a rule a narrative of single-hearted heroism.
I have listened to a Boer version of a lion-hunt, and I
have heard the facts from other members of the same
party; and the contrast was a lesson in the finer arts
of embroidery. But this society had its compensations.
Those men live on the outer fringe of Boerdom;
they have no part in politics and few ties to the
civilised society of Pretoria; and the result is that
race hatred and memory of old strifes have always had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
a smaller place in their hearts. Without the virtues
of their countryman, they are often free from his more
unsocial failings.</p>

<p>It is as a big-game hunter that he has acquired his
reputation, and by big game he meant the lion and
the elephant, animals which he had to go farther
afield and run greater risks to secure. The old race
of elephant-hunters were a strong breed, men in whom
courage from long experience had become a habit;
and certainly they had need of it with their long-stocked
cumbrous flint-locks, which might put out a
man&rsquo;s shoulder in the recoil. They knew their business
and took no needless risks, for elephant-hunting
is a thing which can be learned. Save in thick bush,
there is little real danger; and if the hunter awaits a
charging elephant, a point-blank shot at a few yards
will generally make the animal swerve. Mr Selous,
whose authority is beyond question, has drawn these
men as they appeared to him in Mashonaland&mdash;skilful
shikarris, but jealous, uncompanionable, often treacherous
as we count honour in sport; and Oswell&rsquo;s
story is the same. The lion, which, in spite of
tales to the contrary, remains one of the two most
dangerous quarries in the world, was a different affair
to them. There was little commercial profit from
shooting him, and they had no other motive to face
danger. Nor can we blame them, for a charging lion
to a man with an uncertain gun means almost as sure
destruction as a shipwreck in mid-ocean. The Boer
hunter shot him for protection, rarely for sport. Very
few of the lions killed on the high veld fell to rifles; a
trap-gun set near a drinking-place was the ordinary
way of dealing with them. Mr Ericsen, the most
famous of Kalahari pioneers, who brought many herds
of Ovampa and Damara cattle across the desert, used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
to tell this story of Boer prowess in lion-hunting. He
was travelling with a party of Boer hunters, and one
night a lion killed one of the oxen. The men were in
a fury, and urged Mr Ericsen to follow, bragging that
each of them was prepared to tackle the beast single-handed.
Mr Ericsen said that he was no hunter, but
promised to let them have his dogs and natives to
follow up the spoor in the morning. But when the
morning came the party had silently dispersed,
mortally afraid lest they should be expected to
fulfil their promises. In the long list of South
African big-game hunters the names are mostly
English,&mdash;Gordon-Cumming, Byles, Hartley, Oswell,
Sharpe, Selous, Francis, John Macdonald,&mdash;and the
reason does not wholly lie in the inability and disinclination
of the Boer to bring his deeds from the
rhetoric of talk to the calmer record of print.</p>

<p>At other four-footed game, from the buffalo to the
duiker, the Boer was generally a fair shot, in some
cases a good shot, but very rarely a great shot. Reputation
in marksmanship was very much a matter of
accident. A happy fluke with them, as with natives,
might make a reputation for life, though the man in
question shot badly ever afterwards. The number of
Boer marksmen of the first rank could be counted on
the ten fingers. On the other hand, the nature of
their life produced a very high average. The Boer
boy shot from the day he could hold a rifle, and there
were few utter failures among them. To be sure, it
was not pretty shooting. His first business was to
get the game, and if he could do it by sitting on a
tree near the stream and killing at twenty yards, he
did it gladly. When he went hunting he reflected
that his cartridges cost him 3d. apiece, and were
all that stood between him and starvation; so very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
naturally he became as poky a shot as the English
gamekeeper who is sent out to kill for the table. If a
hunter took out 500 cartridges and brought back 120
head of game, he was reckoned a good man at his
work. To this, of course, there were exceptions, such
as old Jan Ludig, who once in Waterberg shot five
gnu (who travel in Indian file) within seven miles.
The name of Mr Van Rooyen, too, familiar to all
Matabele hunters, shows what the Dutch race can
produce in the way of marksmanship and veld-craft.
In one branch of the chase they were consummate
masters. The Boer method of stalking is an art by
itself, for it is really a kind of driving, by showing
oneself at strategic points till the game is forced into
suitable ground. In open country they also followed
with great success the method of riding down.
Mounted on a good shooting pony, the hunter galloped
alongside a herd till he was within reasonable
distance; then in a trice he was on the ground, had
selected his animal, and fired&mdash;all within a few
seconds. This was a risky game for a large party,
owing to the very rude etiquette which prevailed on
the subject of shooting in your neighbour&rsquo;s direction;
and I have heard of many seriously wounded and even
killed by their companions&rsquo; shots. Still another way
was to ride alongside an animal and shoot him from
the saddle at a few paces&rsquo; distance. This was called
&ldquo;brandt&rdquo; or &ldquo;burning,&rdquo; and required a firm seat and
a very steady eye.</p>

<p>Birds were thought little of, except by some of the
more advanced farmers and by sportsmen from the
towns. The country is full of many excellent sporting
birds: guineafowl, quail, francolin, duck, geese, and
several kinds of partridge and bustard; but though
a few farmers shot wildfowl on their dams, the average
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Boer was a poor shot with a gun, and when he
did use one he liked to take his birds sitting. A
hunter might kill a bird neatly with a rifle, which he
would miss at shorter range with a shot-gun. This
fashion is quickly passing. Many farmers possess excellent
guns of the latest pattern; and I have known
Boers who could hold their own with credit in Norfolk
or Perthshire. As shooting is becoming more of a
sport and less of a business, etiquette is growing up;
and the Boer is learning to spare does and ewes and
take pleasure in hard shots, where his father would
have slaughtered casually and walked long and far to
spare his cartridges. The new order is bringing better
manners, but nothing can restore the noble herds of
game which fell unlamented and unnoted under the
old <i>rigime</i>.</p>

<p>Other sports were scarcely considered. He rarely
fished, leaving the catching of yellow-fish, tiger-fish,
and barbel to the Kaffirs; and when he did, his rod
and tackle were neolithic in their simplicity. I have
never seen a Boer rod which had any of the proper
attributes of a rod, and he used to profess scorn for a
man with a greenheart or a split-cane as for one who
would stipulate for an elegant spade before digging
potatoes. Sometimes in a village or among neighbouring
farmers flat-races would be got up; but the
Boer pony was bred more for endurance than for
speed, and a small selling-plate meeting was about
the limit of his horse-racing. I have never seen or
heard of a Boer steeplechase. On the other hand, he
had a wonderful skill, as our army discovered, in riding
at full speed over a breakneck country,&mdash;a skill due,
perhaps, more to veld-craft than to horsemanship.
Hunting big game on horseback taught him, as part
of the business, to leave much to his horse; and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
horse rarely played him false. Whether he was clattering
down a stony hillside, or dodging through thick
scrub, or racing over veld honeycombed with ant-bear
holes, he rode with a loose rein and full confidence
in his animal. It is difficult to frame an opinion
on his horsemanship. His long stirrups, the easy
&ldquo;tripple&rdquo; of his horse, and his loose seat make him
a type of horseman very different to our cavalryman
or Leicestershire master of hounds. But, loose as he
sits, he can stick on over most kinds of country, and
he is a natural horsemaster of the first order. A Boer
knows by instinct how to manage his horse: he never
frets him; he rarely ill-treats him; and he can judge to
a mile the limits of his endurance.</p>

<p>As a sportsman, then, the Boer is scarcely at his best.
He has shown himself dull, sluggish, unimaginative,
capable of both skill and endurance, but a niggard in
the exercise of either, unless compelled by hunger or
hope of gain. Unlike most races, it is in his sports
that he shows his most unlovely traits, and that flat
incomprehensible side of his character which has
puzzled an ornamental world. The truth is that he
is, speaking broadly, without imagination and that
dash of adventure which belongs to all imaginative
men. The noble spurs of the Drakensberg rose within
sight of his home; but he would as soon have thought
of climbing a peak for the sport or the scenery as of
dabbling in water-colours. A dawn was to him only
the beginning of the day, a mellow veld sunset merely
a sign to outspan; and I should be afraid to guess his
thoughts on a primrose by the river&rsquo;s brim, or whatever
is the South African equivalent. His religion
made him credulous, but his temperament transformed
the most stupendous of the world&rsquo;s histories into a
kind of Farmer&rsquo;s Almanac, and Eastern poetry became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
for him a literal record of fact. A friend of mine,
travelling with a Boer hunter in the far north, called
his attention to the beauty of the starry night, and,
thinking to interest his companion, told him a few
simple astronomical truths. The Boer angrily asked
him why he lied so foolishly. &ldquo;Do not I read in the
Book,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the world stands on four
pillars?&rdquo; And when my friend inquired about the
foundation of the pillars, the Boer sulked for two
days. But there is one trait which he shared with
all true sportsmen, a love of wild animals. To be
sure, the finest reserves of buck were made by new-comers,
such as Mr van der Byl&rsquo;s park at Irene and
Mr Forbes&rsquo;s at Athole, in Ermelo, both unhappily
ruined by the war. But many veld farmers had their
small reserves of springbok or blesbok, and permitted
no hunting within them. Some did it as a speculation,
being always ready to lease a day&rsquo;s shooting to a
gun from Johannesburg, and many for the reason that
they sought big farms and complete solitude&mdash;to
pander to a sense of possession. But in all, perhaps,
there was a strain of honest pleasure in wild life, a
desire to encircle their homes with the surroundings
of their early hunting days. In which case, it is
another of the anomalies which warn us off hasty
generalisations.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h4>THE BOER IN ALL SERIOUSNESS.<a name="FNanchor_10_10"
id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></h4>

<p>The Boer character has suffered by its simplicity. It
has, as a rule, been crudely summed up in half a dozen
denunciatory sentences, or, in the case of more curious
students, it has been analysed and defined with a
subtlety for which there is no warrant. A hasty
condemnation is not the method for a product so full
of difficulty and interest, and a chain of laborious
paradoxes scarcely enables us to comprehend a thing
which is pre-eminently broad and simple. The Boer
has rarely been understood by people who give their
impressions to the world, but he has been very completely
understood by plain men who have dwelt
beside him and experienced his ways in the many
relations of life. It is easy to dismiss him with a
hostile epigram; easy, too, to build up an edifice of
neat contradictions, after the fashion of what Senancour
has called &ldquo;le vulgaire des sages,&rdquo; and label it the
Boer character. The first way commends itself to
party feeling; the second appeals to a nation which
has confessedly never understood its opponents, and
is ready now to admit its ignorance and excuse itself
by the amazing complexity of the subject. Sympathy,
which is the only path to true understanding, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
made difficult by the mists of war, and, when all was
over, by the exceeding dreariness of the conquered
people. There was little romance in the slouching
bearded men with flat faces and lustreless eyes who
handed in their rifles and came under our flag;
National Scouts, haggling over money terms, and the
begging tour of the generals, seemed to have reduced
honour to a matter of shillings and pence, and dispelled
the glamour of many hard-fought battlefields.
There is a perennial charm about an <i>ancien rigime</i>;
but this poor <i>ancien rigime</i> had no purple and fine
gold for the sentimental&mdash;only a hodden-grey burgess
society, an unlovely Kirk, and a prosaic constitution.</p>

<p>And yet the proper understanding of this character
is of the first political importance, and a task well
worth undertaking for its own sake. Those men are
for ever our neighbours and fellow-citizens, and it is
the part of wisdom to understand the present that it
may prepare against the future. To the amateur of
racial character there is the chance of reading in the
largest letters the lesson of historical development,
for we know their antecedents, we can see clearly the
simple events of their recent history, and we have
before us a product, as it were, isolated and focussed
for observation. Nor can sympathy be wanting in
a fair observer,&mdash;sympathy for courage, tenacity of
purpose, a simple fidelity to racial ideals. No man
who has lived much with the people can regard them
without a little aversion, a strong liking, and a large
and generous respect.</p>

<p>In any racial inquiry there are certain determinant
factors which form the axioms of the problem. In
the case of a long-settled people these are so intricate
and numerous that it is impossible to disentangle
more than a few of the more obvious, and we explain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
development, naturally and logically, rather by the
conscious principles which the race assimilated than
by the objective forces which acted upon it from the
outer world. But in the case of a savage or a backward
nation, the history is simple, the ingredients in
racial character few and intelligible. The wars of the
spirit and the growth of philosophies are potent influences,
but their history is speculative and recondite.
But the struggle for bare life falls always in simple
forms, and physical forces leave their mark rudely
upon the object they work on. In this case we have
a national life less than a century long, a mode of
society all but uniform, a creed short and unsophisticated,
an intelligible descent, and a country which
stamps itself readily upon its people. Origin, history,
natural environment, accidental modes of civilisation,
these are the main factors in that composite thing
we call character. We can read them in the individual:
we can read them writ large in a race which
is little more than the individual writ large. In
complex societies the composition is a chemical
process, the result is a new product, not to be
linked with any ingredient; the soul and mind of
the populace is something different in kind from the
average soul and mind of its units. But in this
collection of hardy individualists there was no novel
result, and the type is repeated with such scanty
variations that we may borrow the attributes of the
individual for our definition of the race.</p>

<p>Descent, history, natural environment have laid the
foundation of the Boer character. The old sluggish
Batavian stock (not of the best quality, for the first
settlers were as a rule of the poorest and least reputable
class) was leavened with a finer French strain,
and tinctured with a little native blood. Living a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
clannish life in solitude, the people intermarried closely,
and suffered the fate of inbreeders in a loss of facial
variety and a gradual coarsening of feature. Their
history was a record of fierce warfare with savage
nature, and the evolution of a peculiar set of traditions
which soon came into opposition with imported
European ideas. They evolved, partly from the needs
of their society and partly from distorted echoes of
revolutionary dogma, an embryo political creed, and in
religion they established a variant of sixteenth-century
Protestantism. Their life, and the vast spaces
of earth and sky amid which they lived, strengthened
the patriarchal individualism in their blood. The
whole process of development, so remote from the
common racial experience, produced in the Boer
character a tissue of contradictions which resist all
attempts at an easy summary. He was profoundly
religious, with the language of piety always on his
lips, and yet deeply sunk in matter. Without imagination,
he had the habits of a recluse and in a
coarse way the instincts of the poet. He was extremely
narrow in a bargain, and extremely hospitable.
With a keen sense of justice, he connived at
corruption and applauded oppression. A severe moral
critic, he was often lax, and sometimes unnatural, in
his sexual relations. He was brave in sport and
battle, but his heroics had always a mercantile basis,
and he would as soon die for an ideal, as it is commonly
understood, as sell his farm for a sixpence.
There were few virtues or vices which one could deny
him utterly or with which one could credit him honestly.
In short, the typical Boer to the typical observer
became a sort of mixture of satyr, Puritan,
and successful merchant, rather interesting, rather
distasteful, and wholly incomprehensible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
And yet the phenomenon is perfectly normal. The
Boer is a representative on a grand scale of a type
which no nation is without. He is the ordinary backward
countryman, more backward and more of a
countryman than is usual in our modern world. At
one time this was the current view&mdash;a &ldquo;race of farmers,&rdquo;
a &ldquo;pastoral folk&rdquo;; but the early months of the
war brought about a reversal of judgment, and he
was credited with the most intricate urban vices.
Such a false opinion was the result of a too conventional
view of the rural character. There is nothing
Arcadian about the Boer, as there is certainly nothing
Arcadian about the average peasant. A Corot background,
a pastoral pipe, and a flavour of honeysuckle,
must be expelled from the picture. To analyse what
is grandiloquently called the &ldquo;folk-heart,&rdquo; is to see in
its rude virtues and vices an exact replica of the life
of the veld. &ldquo;Simple&rdquo; and &ldquo;pastoral,&rdquo; on a proper
understanding of the terms, are the last words in
definition.</p>

<p>Let us take an average household. Jan Celliers
(pronounced Seljee) lives on his farm of 3000 morgen
with his second wife and a family of twelve. His
father was a voortrekker, and the great Sarel was a
far-out cousin. Two cousins of his mother and their
families squat as bywoners on his land, and an orphan
daughter of his sister lives in his household. The
farmhouse is built of sun-dried bricks, whitewashed in
front, and consists of a small kitchen, a large room
which is parlour and dining-room in one, and three
small chambers where the family sleep. Twelve families
of natives live in a little kraal, cultivate their own
mealie-patches, and supply the labour of the farm,
while two half-caste Cape boys, Andries and Abraham,
who attend to the horses, have a rude shanty behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the stable. Jan has a dam from which he irrigates
ten acres of mealies, pumpkins, and potatoes. For the
rest he has 500 Afrikander oxen, which make him a
man of substance among his neighbours, including two
spans of matched beasts, fawn and black, for which he
has refused an offer of #30 apiece. He is not an active
farmer, for he does not need to bestir himself. His
land yields him with little labour enough to live on,
and a biscuit-tin full of money, buried in the orchard
below the fifth apricot-tree from the house, secures his
mind against an evil day. But he likes to ride round
his herds in the early morning, and to smoke his pipe
in his mealie-patch of a late afternoon. He is not
fond of neighbours, but it is pleasant to him once in a
while to go to Pretoria and buy a cartload of fancy
groceries and the very latest plough in the store. As
a boy Jan was a great hunter, and has been with his
father to the Limpopo and the Rooi Rand; but of late
game has grown scarce, and Jan is not the fellow to stir
himself to find it. Now and then he shoots a springbok,
and brags wonderfully about his shots, quite
regardless of the presence of his sons who accompany
him. These sons are heavy loutish boys, finer shots
by far than Jan, for they have that infallible eyesight
of the Boer youth. They, too, are idle, and are
much abused by their mother, when she is wide awake
enough to look after them. The daughters are plump
and shapeless, with pallid complexions inside their
sun-bonnets, and a hoydenish shyness towards neighbours.
Not that they see many neighbours, though
rumour has it that young Coos Pretorius, son of
the rich Pretorius, comes now and then to &ldquo;opsitten&rdquo;
with the eldest girl. Jan believes in an Old Testament
God, whom he hears of at nachtmaals, for the kirk is
too far off for the ordinary Sabbath-day&rsquo;s journey; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
he believes much more in a spook which lives in the
old rhinoceros-hole in the spruit, and in his own
amazing merits. He is sleepily good-natured towards
the world, save to a Jew storekeeper in the town who
calls himself on the sign above his door the &ldquo;Old
Boer&rsquo;s Friend,&rdquo; and on one occasion cheated him out of
#5. But Jan has also had his triumphs, notably when
he induced a coal prospector to prospect in an impossible
place and leave him, free of cost, an excellent
well. When war broke out Jan and three of his sons,
sorely against their will, went out on commando. Two
of the boys went to Ceylon, one fell at Spionkop, and
Jan himself remained in the field till the end, and came
back as proud as a peacock to repatriation rations.
His womenfolk were in the Middelburg Burgher camp,
where they acquired a taste for society which almost
conquered their love for the farm. At any rate, it was
with bitter complaints that they sat again under a
makeshift roof, with no neighbours except the korhaan
and a span of thin repatriation oxen. Jan did not
enjoy war. At first he was desperately afraid, and
only the strangeness of the country and the presence
of others kept him from trekking for home. By-and-by
he found amusement in the sport of the thing, and
realised that with caution he might keep pretty well
out of the way of harm. But in the guerilla warfare
of the last year there was no sport, only stark unrelieved
misery. Sometimes he thought of slipping
over to the enemy and surrendering; often he wished
he had been captured and sent to Ceylon with his
boys; but something which he did not understand and
had never suspected before began to rise in his soul, a
wild obstinacy and a resolve to stand out to the last.
Once in a night attack he was chased by two mounted
infantrymen, and turned to bay in a narrow place,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
shooting one man and wounding the other badly. He
did his best for the sufferer before making off to the
rendezvous, an incident which has appeared in the
picture papers (Jan is depicted about eight feet high,
with a face like Moses, whereas he really is a broken-nosed
little man), and which shows that he had both
courage and kindness somewhere in his slow soul. But
he gladly welcomed peace; he had never cared greatly
for politics, and had an ancestral grudge against the
Kruger family; and when he had assured himself that,
instead of losing all, he would get most of his property
back, and perhaps a little for interest, he became quite
loyal, and figured prominently on the local repatriation
board. He takes the resident magistrate out shooting,
and has just sold to the Government a fraction of his
farm at an enormous profit.</p>

<p>Such is an ordinary type of our new citizens. If
we look at him the typical countryman stands out
clear from the mists of tortuous psychology. It is an
error, doubtless, to assume that the primitive nature
is always simple; it is often bewilderingly complex.
An elaborate civilisation may produce a type which
can be analysed under a dozen categories; while the
savage or the backwoodsman may show a network of
curiously interlaced motives. But the man is familiar.
We know others of the family; we have met him in
the common relations of life; he stands before us as
a concrete human being.</p>

<p>His most obvious characteristic is his mental
sluggishness. Dialectic rarely penetrates the chain-armour
of his prejudices. He has nothing of the
keen receptive mind which, like a sensitive plant, is
open to all the influences of life. His views are the
outcome of a long and sluggish growth, and cling like
mandrakes to the roots of his being. He makes no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
deductions from ordinary events, and he never follows
a thing to its logical conclusion. His blind faith
requires a cataclysm to shake it, and to revise a belief
is impossible for him save under the stress of pain.
Death and burning towns may reveal to him a principle,
but unless it is written large in letters of blood
and fire it escapes his stagnant intelligence. Change
is painful to all human creatures, but such coercion of
change is doubly painful, since he has no scheme of
thought into which it can fit, and it means, therefore,
the upturning of the foundations of his world. But
the countryman, while he holds tenaciously his innermost
beliefs, has a vast capacity for doing lip-service
to principles which he does not understand. He sees
that certain shibboleths command respect and bring
material gain, so he glibly adopts them without
allowing them for a moment to encroach upon the
cherished arcana of his faith. Hence comes the apparent
inconsistency of many simple folk. The Boer
had a dozen principles which he would gladly sell to
the highest bidder; but he had some hundreds of
prejudices which he held dearer (almost) than life.
His principles were European importations, democratic
political dogmas, which he used to excellent purpose
without caring or understanding, moral maxims which
bore no relation to his own ragged and twisted ethics.
The mild international morality which his leaders were
wont to use as a reproach to Britain seems comically
out of place when we reflect upon the high-handed international
code, born of filibustering and Kaffir wars,
which he found in the Scriptures and had long ago
adopted for his own. His political confession of faith,
which the framers of his constitution had borrowed
from Europe and America, with its talk of representation
and equal rights and delegated powers, contrasted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
oddly with the fierce individualism which was his
innermost conviction, and the cabals and &ldquo;spoils to
the victor&rdquo; policy which made up his daily practice.
His religion had a like character. In its essentials it
was the same which a generation or two ago held sway
over Galloway peasants and Hebridean fishermen;
but the results were very different. The stern hard-bitten
souls who saw the devil in most of the works of
God, and lived ever under a great Taskmaster&rsquo;s eye,
had no kinship with the easy-going sleek-lipped Boer
piety. The Boer religion in practice was a judicious
excerpt from the easier forms of Christianity, while its
theory was used to buttress his self-sufficiency and
mastery over weaker neighbours. His political creed
may be stated shortly as a belief in his right to all
new territories in which he set foot, his indefeasible
right to control the native tribes in the way he thought
best, a denial of all right of the State to interfere with
him, but an assertion of the duty of the State to enrich
him. To these cardinal articles liberty, equality,
and fraternity were added as an elegant appendage
before publication. So, too, in his religion: God made
man of two colours, white and black, the former to
rule the latter till the end of time; God led Israel out
of Egypt and gave to them new lands for their inalienable
heritage; any Egyptian who followed was
the apportioned prey of the chosen people, and it was
a duty to spoil him; this beneficent God must therefore
be publicly recognised and frequently referred to
in the speech of daily life, but in the case of the Elect
considerable latitude may be allowed in the practice of
the commandments,&mdash;such may fairly be taken as the
ordinary unformulated Boer creed. But, as the statement
was too short and bare, all the finer virtues had
to be attached in public profession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
A countryman lives in a narrow world which he
knows intimately, but beyond is an unexplored region
which he knows of by hearsay and fears. He is not
naturally suspicious. Among his fellows he is often
confiding to a fault, and a little acquaintance with
a dreaded object will often result in a revulsion to
contempt. The Boer has in a peculiar degree this
characteristic of rural peoples. He has an immense
awe of an alien Power while he does not know it, but
once let it commit itself to some weakness, and the
absence of all mental perspective changes the exaggerated
awe into an equally exaggerated condescension.
This truth is written clear over the whole history of
England in Africa. A lost battle, a political withdrawal,
a wavering statesman, have had moral effects
of incalculable significance. The burgher who opposed
us with terror and despair became at the first gleam
of success a screeching cock-of-the-walk, and this attitude,
jealously fostered, obscured the world to him
for the rest of his days. In our threats he saw bluster,
in our kindness he read weakness, in our diplomacy
folly; and he went out at last with the fullest confidence,
which three years of misery have scarcely
uprooted. This is one side of the parochial mind; the
other is the suspicion which became his attitude to
everything beyond his beacons. It is not the proverbial
&ldquo;slimness&rdquo;; that graceful quality is merely
the rustic cunning which he thought the foundation
of business, a quality as common on Australian stock-runs
and Scottish sheep-farms. His suspicion was his
own peculiar possession, born of his history and his
race, and, above all, of his intercourse with native
tribes. He did not give his confidence readily, as who
would if he believed that the world was in league
against him? New ideas, new faces, new inventions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
were all put on his black list. Like Mr By-ends, he
found his principles easy and profitable, and was
resolved to stick to them. Two forces, however,
tended to undermine his distrust. One was his intense
practicality. If his principles ceased to be profitable,
he was prepared, against the grain, to consider
emendations. The second was his crude pleasure in
novelties, the curious delight of a child in a mechanical
toy. A musical box, a portrait of Mr Kruger which,
when wound up, emitted the Volkslied, or the latest
variety of mealie-crusher, were attractions which he
had no power to resist.</p>

<p>At the root of all his traits lies a meagre imagination.
In religion he turns the stupendous tales of
Scripture into a parish chronicle, with God as a
benevolent burgomaster and Moses and the prophets as
glorified landrosts. In politics no Boer since President
Burgers saw things with a large vision, and his
rhetorical dreams were folly to his countrymen. The
idea of a great Afrikander state, very vigorously held
elsewhere in South Africa, had small hold on the
ordinary population of the Republics, save upon sons of
English fathers or mothers, half-educated journalists,
and European officials. In the wars which he waged
he saw little of the murky splendour which covers the
horrors of death. The pageantry of the veld was nothing
to him, and in the amenities of life he scarcely advanced
beyond bare physical comfort. He had neither
art nor literature. If we except Mr Reitz&rsquo;s delightful
verses, which at their happiest are translations of
Burns and Scott, he had not even the songs which are
commonly found among rural peoples. His nursery
tales and his few superstitions were borrowed from the
Kaffir. On one side only do we discern any trace of
imaginative power. Somehow at the back of his soul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
was the love of the wilds and the open road&mdash;a call
which, after years of settled life, had still power to stir
the blood of the old hunter. He was not good at
pictorial forecasts, but he had one retrospect stamped
on his brain, and this hunger for old days was a spark
of fire which kept warm a corner of his being.</p>

<p>The typical countryman he remains, typical in his
limitations and the vices which followed them. The
chief was his incurable mendacity. Truth-speaking
is always a relative virtue, being to some men an easy
habit, and to others of a livelier fancy a constant
and strenuous effort. The Boer is not brutal, he is
eminently law-abiding and sober, and kindly in most
of the relations of life. He has the rustic looseness in
sexual morals, and in the remoter farmhouses this
looseness often took the form of much hideous and
unnatural vice. But the cardinal fault, obvious to the
most casual observer, is a contempt for truth in every
guise. Masterful liars, who have held their own in
most parts of the world, are vanquished by the systematic
perjury of the veld. The habit is, no doubt,
partly learned from the Kaffir, a fine natural professor
of the art; but to its practice the Boer brought a
stolid patience, an impassive countenance, and a
limited imagination which kept him consistent. He
bragged greatly, since to a solitary man with a high
self-esteem this is the natural mode of emphasising his
personality on the rare occasions when he mixes with
his fellows. He lied in business for sound practical
reasons. He lied at home by the tacit consent of his
household. The truest way to outwit him, as many
found, was to tell him the naked truth, since his
suspicion saw in every man his own duplicity. But
because he is a true countryman, when once he has
proved a man literally truthful he will trust him with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
a pathetic simplicity. There were Englishmen in the
land before the war, as there are Englishmen to-day,
whose word to the Boer mind was an inviolable
oath.</p>

<p>So far I have described the average Boer failings
with all the unsympathetic plainness which a hostile
observer could desire. But there is a very different
side to which it is pleasant to turn. If he has the
countryman&rsquo;s faults strongly developed, he has also in
a high degree the country virtues. Simplicity is not
an unmixed blessing; but it is the mother of certain
fine qualities, which are apt to be lost sight of by a
sophisticated world. He could live bare and sleep
hard when the need arose; and if he was sluggish in
his daily life it was the indolence of the sleepy natural
world and not the enervation of decadence. Because
his needs were few he was supremely adaptable: a
born pioneer, with his household gods in a waggon
and his heart turning naturally to the wilds. The
grandeur of nature was lost on him; but there is a
certain charm in the way in which he brought all
things inside the pale of his domesticity. His homely
images have their own picturesqueness, as when he
called the morning star, which summoned him to
inspan, the <i>voorlooper</i>, or &ldquo;little boy who leads out
the oxen.&rdquo; It is the converse of sublimity, and itself
not unsublime. His rude dialect, almost as fine as lowland
Scots for telling country stories, is full of metaphors,
so to speak, in solution, often coarse, but always
the fruit of direct and vigorous observation. In short,
he had a personality which stands out simply in all his
doings, making him a living clear-cut figure among
the amorphous shades of the indoor life.</p>

<p>Wild tales and judicious management from Pretoria
succeeded in combining him temporarily into a semblance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of a state and a very formidable reality of an
army; but at bottom he is the most dogmatic individualist
in the world. His allegiance was never to
a chief or a state, but to his family. The family was
generously interpreted, so that distant relations came
within its fold. This clannishness has not been sufficiently
recognised; but it is a real social force, and
of great importance to a survey of Boer society. In
the country farms, with their system of bywoners,
a whole cycle of relations lived, all depending upon
the head of the household for their subsistence. When
sons or daughters married they lived on in the homestead,
and as their children grew up and married in
turn they squatted on a corner of the farm. The
system led to abuses, notably in the ridiculous subdivision
of land and the endless servitudes and burdens
imposed on real estate; but it relieved the community
of any need for orphanages and workhouses. The
Boer&rsquo;s treatment of orphans does him much credit.
However poor, a family would make room for orphaned
children, and there was no distinction in their usage.
It is a primitive virtue, a heritage from the days
when white folk were few in numbers: a little family
in the heart of savagery, bound together by a common
origin and a common fear.</p>

<p>But his chief virtue was his old-fashioned hospitality.
A stranger rarely knocked at his gates in vain. You
arrived at a farmhouse and asked leave to outspan by
the spruit. Permission was freely granted, and in a
little girls came out with coffee for the travellers. An
invitation to supper usually followed, and there is no
better fare in the world than a chicken roasted by a
Boer housewife and her home-made sausages. Then
followed slow talk over deep-bowled pipes, and then
good-night, with much handshaking and good wishes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
And so all over the veld. The family might be
wretchedly poor, but they dutifully and cheerfully
gave what they had. In the early months of peace
it was a common thing to come on a Boer family
living in a hut of biscuit tins or a torn tent, with
scanty rations and miserably ragged clothes. But
those people, in most cases, set the little they had
gladly before the stranger. The Boer, who will
perjure himself deeply to save a shilling, will part
with a pound&rsquo;s worth of entertainment without a
thought.</p>

<p>And, as a host, he has a natural dignity beyond
praise. A placid life, backed by an overwhelming
sense of worth, is a fine basis for good manners.
Boastfulness and prejudice may come later, but the
first impression is of an antique kindliness and ease.
The veld has no nerves, no uneasy consciousness of
inferiority, least of all the cringing friendliness of
the low European. The farmer, believing in nothing
beyond his ken, makes the stranger welcome as a
harmless courier from a trivial world. No contrast
can be more vivid than between the nervous, bustling
cosmopolitans who throng the Rand and the silent
veld-dwellers. The Boer type of countenance is not
often handsome; frequently it is flat and expressionless,
lustreless grey eyes with small pupils, and hair
growing back from chin and lip. But it is almost
always the embodiment of repose, and in the finer
stock it sometimes reaches an archaic and patriarchal
dignity. The same praise cannot be given to the
<i>jeunesse dorie</i> of the Afrikander world, who acquired
the smattering of an education and migrated
to the towns. Ignorant, swaggering, mentally and
bodily underbred, they form a distressing class of
people who have somehow missed civilisation and hit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
upon the vulgarity of its decline. They claim glibly
and falsely the virtues which their fathers possessed
without advertisement. Much of the bad blood and
spurious nationalism in the country comes from this
crew, who, in partnership with the worst type of
European adventurer, have done their best to discredit
their nation. The true country Boer regards
them much as the silent elder Mirabeau and Zachary
Macaulay must have regarded their voluble sons&mdash;with
considerable distrust, a little disfavour, and not
a little secret admiration for a trick which has no
place in his world.</p>

<p class="smlpadt">Understanding is the only basis of a policy towards
this remarkable section of our fellow-citizens&mdash;understanding,
and a decent abstinence from subtleties.
We used to flatter our souls that we created our
Empire in a fit of absent-mindedness, and in all our
troubles convinced ourselves that we were destined to
&ldquo;muddle through.&rdquo; But there are limits to this policy
of serene trust in Providence, and it is rather our duty
to thank God we have taken so few falls, and brace
our minds to forethought and prudence. The Boer is
the easiest creature in the world to govern. He is
naturally law-abiding, and he has an enormous respect
for the accomplished fact. True union may take long,
but the nominal amalgamation which is necessary for
smooth government already exists. We must understand
how slow he is to learn, how deep his pride is,
how lively his suspicions. Spiritually he will be a
slow pupil, but with proper care politically he may be
a ready learner. He has a curiously acute sense of
justice, which makes him grumble at compulsion, but
obey, and end by applauding. He is also quick to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
realise what is competent and successful in administration.
He will give everything a fair trial, waiting,
watching, and forming his slow mind; and if a
thing is a practical fiasco, he will laugh at it in the
end. The practical is the last touchstone for him.
He is not easily made drunk with the ideals of
ordinary democracy; an efficient government, however
naked of adornments, will always command his
respect, and the fool, though buttressed with every
sublime aspiration, will find him adamant. To a
government which can estimate the situation soberly
and face it manfully he is a simple problem. But he
will be a hard critic of weakness, and when once his
laggard opinions are formed it will be a giant&rsquo;s task to
shake them. The war has broken his old arrogance,
and he now waits to make up his mind on the new
<i>rigime</i>. We shall get justice from him from the start&mdash;laborious
justice and nothing more. If we fail, all
the honesty of purpose on earth will not save us; for to
the Boer good intentions may preserve a man&rsquo;s soul in
another world, but they cannot excuse him in this one.
There is much practical truth in Bunyan&rsquo;s parable
when he makes Old Honest come &ldquo;from the town of
Stupidity,&rdquo; which town &ldquo;lieth four degrees <em>beyond</em> the
City of Destruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the Boer is once won to our side we shall have
secured one of the greatest colonising forces in the
world. We can ask for no better dwellers upon a
frontier. If the plateaux of our Central and East
African possessions are to be permanently held by the
white man, I believe it will be by this people who
have never turned their back upon a country which
seemed to promise good pasture-land. Other races
send forth casual pioneers, who return and report and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
then go elsewhere; but the Boer takes his wife and
family and all his belongings, and in a decade is
part of the soil. In the midst of any savagery he
will plant his rude domesticity, and the land is won.
With all her colonising activity, Britain can ill afford
to lose from her flag a force so masterful, persistent,
and sure.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<h4>EVENING ON THE HIGH VELD.</h4>

<p>We leave the broken highway, channelled by rains
and rutted by ox-waggons, and plunge into the leafy
coolness of a great wood. Great in circumference
only, for the blue gums and pines and mimosa-bushes
are scarcely six years old, though the feathery leafage
and the frequency of planting make a thicket of the
young trees. The rides are broad and grassy as an
English holt, dipping into hollows, climbing steep
ridges, and showing at intervals little side-alleys,
ending in green hills, with the accompaniment everywhere
of the spicy smell of gums and the deep rooty
fragrance of pines. Sometimes all alien woodland
ceases, and we ride through aisles of fine trees, which
have nothing save height to distinguish them from
Rannoch or Rothiemurchus. A deer looks shyly out,
which might be a roebuck; the cooing of doves, the
tap of a woodpecker, even the hawk above in the blue
heavens, have nothing strange. Only an occasional
widow-bird with its ridiculous flight, an ant-heap to
stumble over, and a clump of scarlet veld-flowers are
there to mark the distinction. Here we have the
sign visible of man&rsquo;s conquest over the soil, and of
the real adaptability of the land. With care and
money great tracts of the high-veld might change
their character. An English country-house, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
deer-park and coverts and fish-ponds, could be created
here and in many kindred places, where the owner
might forget his continent. And in time this will
happen. As the rich man pushes farther out from
the city for his home, he will remake the most complaisant
of countries to suit his taste, and, save for
climate and a certain ineradicable flora and fauna,
patches of Surrey and Perthshire will appear on this
kindly soil.</p>

<p>With the end of the wood we come out upon the
veld. What is this mysterious thing, this veld, so
full of memories for the English race, so omnipresent,
so baffling? Like the words &ldquo;prairie,&rdquo; &ldquo;moor,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;down,&rdquo; it is easy to make a rough mental picture of.
It will doubtless become in time, when South Africa
gets herself a literature, a conventional counter in
description. To-day every London shopboy knows
what this wilderness of coarse green or brown grasses
is like; he can picture the dry streams, the jagged
kopjes, the glare of summer, and the bitter winter
cold. It has entered into patriotic jingles, and has
given a <i>mise-en-schne</i> to crude melodrama. And yet
no natural feature was ever so hard to fully realise.
One cannot think of a monotonous vastness, like the
prairie, for it is everywhere broken up and varied. It
is too great for an easy appreciation, as of an English
landscape, too subtle and diverse for rhetorical generalities&mdash;a
thing essentially mysterious and individual.
In consequence it has a charm which the common
efforts of mother-earth after grandiloquence can never
possess. There is something homely and kindly and
soothing in it, something essentially humane and fitted
to the needs of human life. Climb to the top of the
nearest ridge, and after a broad green valley there
will be another ridge just the same: cross the mountains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
fifty miles off, and the country will repeat itself
as before. But this sameness in outline is combined
with an infinite variety in detail, so that we readily
take back our first complaint of monotony, and wonder
at the intricate novelty of each vista.</p>

<p>Here the veld is simply the broad green side of a
hill, with blue points of mountain peeping over the
crest, and a ragged brown road scarred across it.
The road is as hard as adamant, a stiff red clay baked
by the sun into porphyry, with fissures yawning here
and there, so deep that often it is hard to see the
gravel at the bottom. A cheerful country to drive
in on a dark night in a light English cart, but less
deadly to the lumbering waggons of the farmer. We
choose the grass to ride on, which grows in coarse
clumps with bare soil between. Here, too, are traps
for the loose rider. A conical ant-heap with odd perforations,
an ant-bear hole three feet down, or, most
insidious of all, a meerkat&rsquo;s hole hidden behind a tuft
of herbage. A good pony can gallop and yet steer,
provided the rider trusts it; but the best will make
mistakes, and on occasion roll over like a rabbit.
Most men begin with a dreary apprenticeship to
spills; but it is curious how few are hurt, despite
the hardness of the ground. One soon learns the art
of falling clear and falling softly.</p>

<p>The four o&rsquo;clock December sun blazes down on us,
raising hot odours from the grass. A grey African
hare starts from its form, a meerkat slips away indignantly,
a widow-bird, coy and ridiculous like a flirtatious
widow, flops on ahead. The sleepy, long-horned
Afrikander cattle raise listless eyes as we pass, and a
few gaudy butterflies waver athwart us. Otherwise
there is no sound or sight of life. Flowers of rich
colours&mdash;chrysanthemums, gentians, geraniums&mdash;most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
of them variants of familiar European species, grow in
clumps so lowly that one can only observe them by
looking directly from above. It is this which makes
the veld so colourless to a stranger. There are no
gowans or buttercups or heather, to blazon it like a
spring meadow or an August moorland. Five yards
off, and nothing is visible but the green stalks of
grass or a red boulder.</p>

<p>At the summit of the ridge there is a breeze and a
far prospect. The road still runs on up hill and down
dale, through the distant mountains, and on to the
great pastoral uplands of Rustenburg and the far
north-west. On either side the same waving grass,
now grey and now green as the wind breathes over it.
Below is a glen with a gleam of water, and some yards
of tender lawn on either bank. Farmhouses line the
sides, each with its dam, its few acres of untidy crop
land, and its bower of trees. Beyond rise line upon
line of green ridges, with a glimpse of woods and
dwellings set far apart, till in the far distance the bold
spurs of the Magaliesberg stand out against the sky.
A thin trail of smoke from some veld-fire hangs between
us and the mountains, tempering the intense
clearness of an African prospect. There is something
extraordinarily delicate and remote about the vista; it
might be a mirage, did not the map bear witness to its
reality. It is not unlike a child&rsquo;s conception of the
landscape of Bunyan, a road running straight through
a mystical green country, with the hilltops of the
Delectable Mountains to cheer the pilgrim. And indeed
the land is instinct with romance. The names of
the gorges which break the mountain line&mdash;Olifants&rsquo;
Poort, Crocodile Poort, Commando Nek&mdash;speak of
war and adventure and the far tropics beyond these
pastoral valleys. The little farms are all &ldquo;Rests&rdquo; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
&ldquo;Fountains,&rdquo; the true nomenclature of a far-wandering,
home-loving people. The slender rivulet below us is
one of the topmost branches of the great Limpopo,
rising in a marsh in the wood behind, forcing its way
through the hills and the bush-veld to the north,
and travelling thence through jungles and fever-swamps
to the Portuguese sea-coast. The road is one
of the old highways of exploration; it is not fifty
years since a white man first saw the place. And yet
it is as pastoral as Yarrow or Exmoor; it has the
green simplicity of sheep-walks and the homeliness of
a long-settled rustic land. In the afternoon peace
there is no hint of the foreign or the garish; it is as
remote as Holland itself from the unwholesome splendours
of the East and South.</p>

<p>No landscape is so masterful as the veld. Broken
up into valleys, reclaimed in parts by man, showing
fifty varieties of scene, it yet preserves one essential
character. For, homely as it is, it is likewise untamable.
There are no fierce encroachments about it. A
deserted garden does not return to the veld for many
years, if ever. It is not, like the jungle, the natural
enemy of man, waiting for a chance to enter and
obliterate his handiwork, and repelled only by sleepless
watching. Rather it is the quiet spectator of human
efforts, ready to meet them half-way, and yet from its
vastness always the dominant feature in any landscape.
Its normal air is sad, grey, and Quakerish, never
flamboyant under the brightest sun, and yet both
strenuous and restful. The few red monstrosities man
has built on its edge serve only to set off this essential
dignity. For one thing, it is not created according to
the scale of man. It will give him a home, but he will
never alter its aspect. Let him plough and reap it
for a thousand years, and he may beautify and fructify
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
but never change it. The face of England has altered
materially in two centuries, because England is on a
human scale,&mdash;a parterre land, without intrinsic wildness.
But cultivation on the veld will always be
superimposed: it will remain, like Egypt, ageless and
immutable&mdash;one of the primeval types of the created
world.</p>

<p>But, though dominant, it is also adaptable. It can,
for the moment, assume against its unchangeable
background a chameleon-like variety. Sky and weather
combine to make it imitative at times. Now, under
a pale Italian sky, it is the Campagna&mdash;hot, airless,
profoundly melancholy. Again, when the mist drives
over it, and wet scarps of hill stand out among clouds,
it is Dartmoor or Liddesdale; or on a radiant evening,
when the mountains are one bank of hazy purple, it
has borrowed from Skye and the far West Highlands.
On a clear steely morning it has the air of its namesake,
the Norwegian fjelds,&mdash;in one way the closest of
its parallels. But each phase passes, the tantalising
memory goes, and we are back again upon the aboriginal
veld, so individual that we wonder whence arose
the illusion.</p>

<p>A modern is badly trained for appreciating certain
kinds of scenery. Generations of poets and essayists
have so stamped the &ldquo;pathetic fallacy&rdquo; upon his soul
that wherever he goes, unless in the presence of a
Niagara or a Mount Everest, he runs wild, looking for
a human interest or a historical memory. This is well
enough in the old settled lands, but on the veld it is
curiously inept. The man who, in Emerson&rsquo;s phrase,
seeks &ldquo;to impress his English whim upon the immutable
past,&rdquo; will find little reward for his gymnastics. Not
that there is no history of a kind&mdash;of Bantu wars, and
great tribal immigrations, of wandering gold-seekers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
and Portuguese adventurers, of the voortrekker and
the heroic battles in the wilds. But the veld is so
little subject to human life that had Thermopylf
been fought in yonder nek, or had Saint Francis
wandered on this hillside, it would have mastered
and obliterated the memories. It has its history;
but it is the history of cosmic forces, of the cycle
of seasons, of storms and suns and floods, the joys
and sorrows of the natural world.</p>

<p>Men dreamed of it and its wealth long ago in Portugal
and Holland. They have quarrelled about it in
London and Cape Town, fought for it, parcelled it
out in maps, bought it and sold it. It has been
subject for long to the lusts and hopes of man. It
has been larded with epithets; town-bred folk have
made theories about it; armies have rumbled across
it; the flood of high politics has swept it. But the
veld has no memory of it. Men go and come,
kingdoms fall and rise, but it remains austere,
secluded, impenetrable, &ldquo;the still unravished bride
of quietness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As one lives with it the thought arises, May not
some future civilisation grow up here in keeping with
the grave country? The basis of every civilisation
is wealth&mdash;wealth to provide the background of
leisure, which in turn is the basis of culture in a
commercial world. Our colonial settlements have
hitherto been fortuitous. They have fought a hard
fight for a livelihood, and in the process missed the
finer formative influences of the land. When, then,
civilisation came it was naturally a borrowed one&mdash;English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
with an accent. But here, as in the old
Greek colonies, we begin <i>de novo</i>, and at a certain
high plane of life. The Dutch, our forerunners,
acquired the stamp of the soil, but they lived on
the barest scale of existence, and were without the
aptitude or the wealth to go farther. Our situation
is different. We start rich, and with a prospect of
growing richer. On one side are the mining centres&mdash;cosmopolitan,
money-making, living at a strained
pitch; on the other this silent country. The time
will come when the rich man will leave the towns,
and, as most of them are educated and all are able
men, he will create for himself a leisured country
life. His sons in turn will grow up with something
autochthonous in their nature. For those who are
truly South Africans at heart, and do not hurry to
Europe to spend their wealth, there is a future, we
may believe, of another kind than they contemplate.
All great institutions are rooted and grounded in the
soil. There is an art, a literature, a school of thought
implicit here for the understanding heart,&mdash;no tarnished
European importation, but the natural, spontaneous
fruit of the land.</p>

<p>As we descend into the glen the going underfoot
grows softer, the flinty red clay changes to sand and
soon to an irregular kind of turf. At last we are on
the stream-bank, and the waving grasses have gone.
Instead there is the true meadow growth, reeds and
water-plants and a species of gorgeous scarlet buck-bean;
little runnels from the farm-dams creep among
the rushes, and soon our horses&rsquo; feet are squelching
through a veritable bog. Here are the sights and
sounds of a Hampshire water-meadow. Swallows
skim over the pools; dragon-flies and bees brush
past; one almost expects to see a great trout raise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
a sleepy head from yonder shining reach. But there
are no trout, alas! none, I fear, nearer than Natal;
only a small greenish barbel who is a giant at four
to the pound. The angler will get small satisfaction
here, though on the Mooi River, above Potchefstroom,
I have heard stories of a golden-scaled monster who
will rise to a sea-trout fly. As we jump the little
mill-lades, a perfect host of frogs are leaping in the
grass, and small bright-eyed lizards slip off the stones
at our approach. But, though the glen is quick with
life, there is no sound: a deep Sabbatical calm broods
over all things. The cry of a Kaffir driver from the
highroad we have left breaks with an almost startling
violence on the quiet. The tall reeds hush the stream&rsquo;s
flow, the birds seem songless, even the hum of insects
is curiously dim. There is nothing for the ear, but
much for the eye and more for the nostril. Our ride
has been through a treasure-house of sweet scents.
First the pines and gum-trees; then the drowsy
sweetness of the sunburnt veld; and now the more
delicate flavour of rich soil and water and the sun-distilled
essences of a thousand herbs. What the old
Greek wrote of Arabia the Blessed might fitly be
written here, &ldquo;From this country there is a smell
wondrous sweet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lower down the glen narrows. The stream would
be a torrent if there were more water; but the
cascades are a mere trickle, and only the deep green
rock-pools, the banks of shingle, and the worn foot of
the cliff, show what this thread can grow to in the
rains. A light wild brushwood begins, and creeps
down to the very edge of the stream. Twenty years
ago lions roamed in this scrub; now we see nothing
but two poaching pariah dogs. We pass many little
one-storeyed farms, each with a flower-garden run
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
to seed, and some acres of tangled crops. All are
deserted. War has been here with its heavy hand,
and a broken stoep, empty windows, and a tumbled-in
roof are the marks of its passage. The owners may
be anywhere&mdash;still on commando with Delarey, in
Bermuda or Ceylon, in Europe, in camps of refuge, on
parole in the towns. Great sunflowers, a foot in
diameter, sprawl over the railings, dahlias and marigolds
nod in the evening sunshine, and broken fruit-trees
lean over the walks. Suddenly from the yard
a huge aasvogel flaps out&mdash;the bird not of war but
of unclean pillage. There is nothing royal in the
creature, only obscene ferocity and a furtive greed. But
its presence, as it rises high into the air, joined with
the fallen rooftrees, effectively drives out Arcady from
the scene. We feel we are in a shattered country.
This quiet glen, which in peace might be a watered
garden, becomes suddenly a desert. The veld is
silent, but such secret nooks will blab their tale
shamelessly to the passer-by.</p>

<p>The stream bends northward in a more open valley,
and as we climb the ridge we catch sight of the country
beyond and the same august lines of mountain. But
now there is a new feature in the landscape. Bushes
are dotted over the far slope, and on the brow cluster
together into something like a coppice. It is a
patch of bush-veld, as rare on our high-veld as are
fragments of the old Ettrick forest in Tweeddale.
Two hundred miles north is the real bush-veld, full of
game and fevers, the barrier between the tropical
Limpopo and these grassy uplands. Seen in the
splendour of evening there is a curious savagery about
that little patch, which is neither veld nor woodland,
but something dwarfish and uncanny. That is Africa,
the Africa of travellers; but thus far we have ridden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
through a countryside so homely and familiar that we
are not prepared for a foreign intrusion. Which leads
us to our hope of a new civilisation. If it ever comes,
what an outlook it will have into the wilds! In England
we look to the sea, in France across a frontier,
even in Russia there is a mountain barrier between
East and West. But here civilisation will march
sharply with barbarism, like a castle of the Pale,
looking over a river to a land of mists and outlaws.
A man would have but to walk northward, out of the
cities and clubs and the whole world of books and
talk, to reach the country of the oldest earth-dwellers,
the untamable heart of the continent. It is much for
a civilisation to have its background&mdash;the Egyptian
against the Ethiopian, Greek against Thracian, Rome
against Gaul. It is also much for a race to have an
outlook, a far horizon to which its fancy can turn.
Even so strong men are knit and art is preserved from
domesticity.</p>

<p>We turn homeward over the long shoulders of hill,
keeping to the track in the failing light. If the place
is sober by day, it is transformed in the evening. For
an hour the land sinks out of account, and the sky is
the sole feature. No words can tell the tale of a veld
sunset. Not the sun dipping behind the peaks of
Jura, or flaming in the mouth of a Norwegian fiord, or
sinking, a great ball of fire, in mid-Atlantic, has the
amazing pageantry of these upland evenings. A flood
of crimson descends on the world, rolling in tides from
the flagrant west, and kindling bush and scaur and
hill-top, till the land glows and pulsates in a riot of
colour. And then slowly the splendour ebbs, lingering
only to the west in a shoreless, magical sea. A delicate
pearl-grey overspreads the sky, and the onlooker thinks
that the spectacle is ended. It has but begun; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
there succeed flushes of ineffable colour,&mdash;purple, rose-pink,
tints of no mortal name,&mdash;each melting imperceptibly
into the other, and revealing again the twilight
world which the earlier pageant had obscured. Every
feature in the landscape stands out with a tender,
amethystine clearness. The mountain-ridge is cut
like a jewel against the sky; the track is a ribbon of
pure beaten gold. And then the light fades, the air
becomes a soft mulberry haze, the first star pricks out
in the blue, and night is come.</p>

<p>Here is a virgin soil for art, if the art arises. In
our modern history there is no true poetry of vastness
and solitude. What there is is temperamental and
introspective, not the simple interpretation of a natural
fact. In the old world, indeed, there is no room for
it: a tortured, crowded land may produce the aptitude,
but it cannot give the experience. And the new lands
have had no chance to realise their freshness: when
their need for literature arose, they have taken it
second-hand. The Australian poet sings of the bush
in the rococo accents of Fleet Street, and when he is
natural he can tell of simple human emotions, but not
of the wilds. For the chance of the seeing eye has
gone. He is not civilised but de-civilised, having
borrowed the raiment of his elder brother. But, if
South African conditions be as men believe, here we
have a different prospect. The man who takes this
country as his own will take it at another level than
the pioneer. The veld will be to him more than a
hunting-ground, and the seasons may be viewed from
another than a commercial standpoint. If the art
arises, it will be an austere art&mdash;with none of the
fatuities of the picturesque, bare of false romance and
preciosities, but essentially large, simple, and true. It
will be the chronicle of the veld, the song of the cycle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
of Nature, the epic of life and death, and &ldquo;the unimaginable
touch of time.&rdquo; Who can say that from
this land some dew of freshness may not descend
upon a jaded literature, and the world be the richer
by a new Wordsworth, a more humane Thoreau, or a
manlier Senancour?</p>

<p>Once more we are in the wood, now a ghostly place
with dark aisles and the windless hush of evening in the
branches. The flying ants are coming out of the ground
for their short life of a night. The place is alive with
wings, moths and strange insects, that go white and
glimmering in the dusk. The clear darkness that
precedes moonrise is over the earth, so that everything
stands out clear in a kind of dark-green monochrome.
Something of an antique dignity, like an evening of
Claude Lorraine, is stealing into the landscape. Once
more the veld is putting on an alien dress, till in
this fairyland weather we forget our continent again.
And yet who shall limit Africa to one aspect? Our
whole ride has been a kaleidoscope of its many phases.
Hot and sunburnt, dry grasses and little streams, the
red rock and the fantastic sunset. And on the other
side the quiet green valleys, the soothing vista of blue
hills, the cool woods, the water-meadows, and the
twilight. It is a land of contrasts&mdash;glimpses of
desert and barbarism, memories of war, relics of old
turmoil, and yet essentially a homeland. As the
phrase goes, it is a &ldquo;white man&rsquo;s country&rdquo;; by
which I understand a country not only capable of
sustaining life, but fit for the amenities of life and the
nursery of a nation. Whether it will rise to a nation
or sink to a territory rests only with its people. But
it is well to recognise its possibilities, to be in love
with the place, for only then may we have the hope
which can front and triumph over the many obstacles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
The first darkness is passing, a faint golden light
creeps up the sky, and suddenly over a crest comes
the African moon, bathing the warm earth in its
cold pure radiance. This moon, at any rate, is the
peculiar possession of the land. At home it is a
disc, a ball of light; but here it is a glowing world
riding in the heavens, a veritable kingdom of fire.
No virgin huntress could personify it, but rather
some mighty warrior-god, driving his chariot among
trampled stars. It lights us out of the wood, and
on to the highroad, and then among the sunflowers
and oleanders of the garden. The night air is cool
and bracing, but soft as summer; and as we dismount
our thoughts turn homeward, and we have a sudden
regret. For in this month and at this hour in that
other country we should be faring very differently.
No dallying with zephyrs and sunsets; but the
coming in, cold and weary, from the snowy hill, and
telling over the peat-fire the unforgettable romance
of winter sport.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<h4>IN THE TRACKS OF WAR.</h4>

<h5>I.</h5>

<p>We left Klerksdorp in a dust-storm so thick and incessant
that it was difficult to tell where the houses
ended and the open country began. The little town,
which may once have been a clean, smiling place, has
been for months the <i>corpus vile</i> of military operations.
A dozen columns have made it their destination; the
transport and supplies of the whole Western Army
have been congested there, with the result that the
town lands have been rubbed bare of grass, the streets
furrowed into dust-heaps, and the lightest breeze
turned into a dust-tornado. Our Cape carts rattled
over the bridge of the Schoon Spruit&mdash;&ldquo;Caller
Water,&rdquo; as we might translate it in Scots, but here
a low and muddy current between high banks&mdash;and,
climbing a steep hill past the old town of Klerksdorp,
came out of the fog into clearer veld, over which a
gale of wind was blowing strongly. The desert was
strewn with empty tins, which caught the sun like
quartz; stands of barbed wire were everywhere on
the broad uneven highway; little dust devils spouted
at intervals on to the horizon. The place was like
nothing so much as a large deserted brick-field in
some Midland suburb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
There is one feature of the high veld which has not
had the attention it deserves&mdash;I mean the wind. Ask
a man who has done three years&rsquo; trekking what he
mostly complains of, and he will be silent about food
and drink, the sun by day and the frost by night,
but he is certain to break into picturesque language
about the wind. The wind of winter blows not so
unkindly as persistently. Day and night the cheek
is flaming from its buffets. There is no shelter from
scrub or kopje, for it is a most cunning wind, and
will find a cranny to whistle through. Little wrinkles
appear round blinking eyes, the voice gets a high
pitch of protest, and a man begins to walk sideways
like a crab to present the smallest surface to his
enemy. And with the wind go all manner of tin-cans,
trundling from one skyline to another with a
most purposeful determination. Somewhere&mdash;S.S.W.
I should put the direction&mdash;there must be a Land of
Tin-cans, where in some sheltered valley all the
<i>dibris</i> of the veld has come to anchor.</p>

<p>About ten o&rsquo;clock the wind abated a little, and the
road passed into a country of low hills with a scrub of
mimosa thorn along the flats. The bustard, which
the Boers have so aptly named &ldquo;korhaan&rdquo; or scolding
cock, strutted by the roadside, a few hawks circled
about us, and an incurious secretary-bird flapped
across our path. The first water appeared,&mdash;a melancholy
stream called Rhenoster Spruit,&mdash;and the
country grew hillier and greener till we outspanned
for lunch at a farmhouse of some pretensions, with a
large dam, a spruit, and a good patch of irrigated
land. The owner had returned, and was dwelling in
a tent against the restoration of his homestead. A
considerable herd of cattle grazed promiscuously on
the meadow, and the farmer with philosophic calm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
was smoking his pipe in the shade. Apparently he
was a man of substance, and above manual toil; for
though he had been back for some time there was no
sign of getting to work on repairs, such as we saw
in smaller holdings. Fairly considered, this repatriation
is a hard nut for the proud, indolent Boer,
for it means the reversal of a life&rsquo;s order. His bywoners
are scattered, his native boys refuse to return
to him; there is nothing for the poor man to do but
to take pick and hammer himself. Sooner or later he
will do it, for in the last resort he is practical, but in
the meantime he smokes and ponders on the mysteries
of Providence and the odd chances of life.</p>

<p>In the afternoon our road lay through a pleasant
undulating land, with green patches along the streams
and tracts of bush relieving the monotony of the grey
winter veld. Every farmhouse we passed was in the
same condition,&mdash;roofless, windowless, dams broken,
water-furrows choked, and orchards devastated. Our
way of making war may be effective as war, but it
inflicts terrible wounds upon the land. After a campaign
of a dozen bloody fights reconstruction is
simple; the groundwork remains for a new edifice.
But, though the mortality be relatively small, our
late methods have come very near to destroying the
foundations of rural life. We have to build again
from the beginning; we have to face questions of
simple existence which seem strange to us, who in
our complex society rarely catch sight of the bones of
the social structure. To be sure there is hope. There
is a wonderful recuperative power in the soil; the
Boer is simpler in habits than most countrymen; and
it is not a generation since he was starting at the
same rudiments. Further, our own settlers will have
the same beginnings, and there is a chance of rural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
communities, Boer and British, being more thoroughly
welded together, because they can advance <i>pari
passu</i> from the same starting-point. But to the new-comer
the situation has a baffling oddness. It seems
strange to be doling out the necessaries of life to a
whole community, to be dealing with a society which
must have been full of shades and divisions like all
rural societies, as a featureless collection of units.
Yet it is probable that the Boers themselves are the
last to realise it. The people who crowded to the
doors of the ruined farms as we passed were on the
whole good-humoured, patient, and uncomplaining.
They had set about repairing the breaches in their
fortunes, crudely but contentedly. At one farm we
saw a curious Arcadian sight in this desert which war
had made. Some small Boer children were herding a
flock of sheep along a stream. A little girl in a sunbonnet
was carrying a lamb; two brown, ragged,
bare-legged boys were amusing themselves with a
penny whistle. To the children war and reconstruction
alike can only have been a game; and hope and
the future are to the young.</p>

<p>From Klerksdorp to Wolmaranstad the distance is
some fifty miles, and it was almost nightfall before we
descended with very weary cattle the long hill to our
outspan. The country was one wide bare wold, the
sky a soft glow of amber; and there was nothing
between amber earth and amber sky save one solitary
korhaan, scolding in the stillness. I do not know who
the first Wolmarans may have been, but he built a
stad very like a little Border town&mdash;all huddled together
and rising suddenly out of the waste. The
Makasi Spruit is merely a string of muddied water-holes,
but in the darkness it might have been the
&ldquo;wan water&rdquo; of Liddel or Yarrow. We camped in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
one of the few rooms that had still a roof, and rid
ourselves of the dust of the road in an old outhouse
in the company of a facetious monkey and a saturnine
young eagle. When we had warmed ourselves and
dined, I began to like Wolmaranstad, and, after a
moonlight walk, I came to the conclusion that it was
a most picturesque and charming town. But Wolmaranstad,
like Melrose, should be seen by moonlight;
for in the morning it looked little more than a collection
of ugly shanties jumbled together in a dusty
patch of veld.</p>


<h5>II.</h5>

<p>On the 12th of August, in the usual dust-storm, we
started for Lichtenburg. There is no highroad, but a
series of wild cross-country paths merging constantly
in farm-roads. No map is quite reliable, and local
information is fallacious. The day being the festival
of St Grouse, we shot conscientiously all morning with
very poor success. The game was chiefly korhaan,
and he is a hard bird to get on terms with. About
the size of a blackcock, and as slow on the wing, he
looks an easy mark; but if stalked, he has a habit of
rising just out of range, and repeating the performance
till he has lured you a mile from your waggon,
when he squawks in triumph and departs into the
void. The orthodox way is to ride round him in
slowly narrowing circles&mdash;a ruse which seems to
baffle his otherwise alert intelligence. The country
was rolling veld dotted with wait-a-bit thorn-bushes;
the farmhouses few but large; the roads heavy with
sand. In one hill-top farm, well named Uitkyk, we
found an old farmer and his son-in-law, who invited
us to enter. The place was in fair order, being out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the track of columns, tolerably furnished, and with
the usual portrait of the Reverend Andrew Murray
on the wall. The farmer had no complaints to make,
being well-to-do and too old to worry about earthly
things; but the son-in-law, a carpenter by trade, was
full of his grievances. The neighbourhood, being in
ruins, was crying for his services, he said, but there
was no material in the country to work with. Building
material was scarce in Johannesburg and Pretoria;
how much scarcer it must be in Wolmaranstad! This
just complaint was frequent on our journey; for the
Transvaal, served by its narrow-gauge single-line railways
choked with military traffic, is badly equipped
with the necessaries of reconstruction, and many willing
workmen have to kick their heels in idleness.</p>

<p>We outspanned at midday near some pools of indifferent
water, which our authorities had enthusiastically
described as an abundant water-supply.
There was a roofless farm close by, where a kind
of hut of biscuit-tins had been erected, in which a
taciturn young woman was nursing a child. There
was also a boy of about sixteen in the place who had
coffee with us, and took us afterwards to stalk korhaan
with a rifle. He was newly home from commando,
full of spirit and good-humour, and handled
longingly the rifle which the law forbade him to
possess. All afternoon we passed roofless farmhouses
crowded with women and children, and in
most cases the farmer was getting forward in the
work of restoration. Dams and water-furrows were
being mended, some kind of roof put on the house,
waggons cobbled together, and in many cases a good
deal of ploughing had been done. The country grew
bleaker as we advanced, trees disappeared, huge wind-swept
downs fell away on each side of the path, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
heavy rain-clouds came up from the west. The real
rains begin in October, but chill showers often make
their appearance in August, and I know nothing more
desolate than the veld in such a storm. By-and-by
we struck the path of a column, ploughed up by heavy
gun-carriages, and in following the track somehow
missed our proper road. The darkness came while
we were yet far from our outspan, crawling up a great
hill, which seemed endless. At the top a fine sight
awaited us, for the whole country in front seemed on
fire. A low line of hills was tipped with flame, and
the racing fires were sweeping into the flats with the
solid regularity of battalions. A moment before, and
we had been in Shelley&rsquo;s</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Wide, grey, lampless, deep, unpeopled world&rdquo;;<br
/></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>now we were in the midst of light and colour and
elfish merriment. To me there is nothing solemn in
a veld-fire&mdash;nothing but madness and fantasy. The
veld, so full at other times of its own sadness, the</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Acerbo indegno mistero della cose,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>becomes demented, and cries an impish defiance to
the austere kings who sit in Orion. The sight raised
our spirits, and we stumbled down the long hillside
in a better temper. By-and-by a house of a sort
appeared in the valley bottom, and a dog&rsquo;s bark
told us that it was inhabited. To our relief we
found that we had actually struck our outspan,
Korannafontein, having approached it from the opposite
side. The Koranna have long since gone from
it, and the sole inhabitant was a Jew storekeeper,
a friendly person, who assisted us to doctor our very
weary horses. The ways of the Jew are past all
finding out. Refuse to grant him a permit for himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and goods, and he says nothing; but he is in
occupation months before the Gentile, unless that
Gentile comes from Aberdeen. Our friend had his
store stocked, and where he got the transport no
man knows. He spoke well of the neighbourhood,
both of Boer and native. The natives here, he said,
are civilised. I asked him his definition of civilisation.
&ldquo;They speak Dutch,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;an answer
worth recording. We camped for the night behind
what had once been the wool-shed. The floor of the
tent was dirty, and, foolishly, I sent a boy to &ldquo;mak
skoon.&rdquo; He made &ldquo;skoon&rdquo; by digging up dust
with a shovel and storing it in heaps in different
corners. About midnight the rain fell heavily, and
a little later a great wind rose and put those dust-heaps
in circulation. I awoke from dreams of salmon-fishing
with a profound conviction that I had been
buried under a landslip. I crawled hastily through
a flap followed by a stream of dust, and no ventilation
could make that tent habitable, so that in the
morning we awoke with faces like colliers, and
throats as dry as the nether millstone.</p>

<p>From Korannafontein to Lichtenburg is something
over forty miles, so we started at daybreak and
breakfasted at a place called Rhenosterput, where
some gentleman sent a Mauser bullet over our heads
to remind us of his presence. The country was downland,
very full of Namaqua partridge and the graceful
spur-winged plover, a ranching country, for the streams
had little fall and less water. At midday we outspanned
at a pretty native village called Rooijantjesfontein,
with a large church after the English village
pattern, and a big dam lined with poplars. The life
of a commercial missionary, who bought a farm when
land was cheap and had it cultivated by his congregation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
is a pleasant one: he makes a large profit,
spends easy days, and returns early to his native
Germany. It is a type I have little patience with,
for it discredits one of the most heroic of human
callings, and turns loose on society the slim Christian
native, who brings Christianity and civilisation alike
into discredit. We were now out of the region of
tracks and on the main road to Lichtenburg, and all
afternoon we travelled across the broad shallow basin
of the Hartz River with our goal full in view on
a distant hill-top. Far off on our right we saw a
curious sight&mdash;a funeral waggon with a train of
mourners creeping slowly across the veld. The
Boers, as we heard from many sources, are exhuming
the dead from different battle-fields, and bringing
them, often from great distances, to the graveyards
on their own homesteads. An odd sombre task, not
without its grandeur; for to the veld farmer, as to
the old Roman, there are Lares and Penates, and
he wishes at the last to gather all his folk around
him.</p>


<h5>III.</h5>

<p>Lichtenburg, as I have said, stands on a hill-top,
but when one enters he finds a perfect model of a
Dutch village. The streets are lined with willows
and poplars, and seamed with water-furrows, and all
the principal buildings surround a broad village green
on which cattle were grazing. Seen in the morning
it lost nothing of its attractiveness; and it dwells
in my memory as a fresh clean place, looking over
a wide upland country,&mdash;a place where men might
lead honest lives, and meet the world fearlessly. It
has its own relics of war. The court-house roof and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
walls are splashed with bullets, relics of Delarey&rsquo;s
fight with the Northumberland Fusileers. General
Delarey is himself the principal inhabitant. He owns
much land in the neighbourhood, and his house stands
a few miles out on the Mafeking road. From this
district was drawn all that was most chivalrous and
resolute in the Boer forces; and the name of their
leader is still a synonym with lovers of good fighting
men for the finest quality of his race.</p>

<p>The Zeerust road is as bad going for waggons as
I have ever seen. It runs for miles through a desert
where the soil is as black as in Lancashire, and a
kind of coaly dust rises in everlasting clouds. We
started late in the day, so that sunset found us
some distance from water, in a featureless country.
We were to outspan at the famous Malmani Oog&mdash;the
eye of the Malmani; but a fountainhead is not
a good goal on a dark night to ignorant travellers.
Shortly after dusk we rode on ahead to look for the
stream. Low slopes of hills rose on all sides, but
nowhere could we see a gleam or a hollow which
might be water. The distance may have been short,
but to a hungry and thirsty man it seemed endless,
as one hill after another was topped without any
result. We found a fork in the road, and took the
turn to the left as being more our idea of the way.
As it happened we were trekking straight for the
Kalahari Desert, and but for the lucky sound of a
waggon on the other road might have been floundering
there to-day. We turned aside to ask for information,
and found we were all but at the Oog, which
lay in the trees a hundred yards off. The owner of
the waggon was returning to Lichtenburg with a sick
wife, whom he had taken to Zeerust for a change. He
had been a road surveyor under the late Government,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
had served on Delarey&rsquo;s staff, and had been taken
prisoner. A quiet reserved man with dignified manners,
he answered our questions without complaint or
petulance. There is something noble in travel when
pursued in this stately leisure. The great buck-waggon,
the sixteen solemn oxen lumbering on, the master
walking behind in the moonlight, have an air of patriarchal
dignity, an elder simplicity. I suppose fifteen
to twenty miles might be a good day&rsquo;s march, but
who shall measure value by miles? It is the life for
dreams, for roadside fires, nights under the stars, new
faces studied at leisure, good country talk, and the
long thoughts of an unharassed soul. Let us by all
means be up and doing, setting the world to rights
and sounding our own trumpet; but is the most successful
wholly at ease in the presence of great mountains
and forests, or men whose lives share in the calm
cycle of nature?</p>

<p>The night in tents was bitterly cold, and the morning
bath, taken before sunrise in the springs of Malmani,
was the most Arctic experience I have ever met.
We left our drivers to inspan and follow, and set off
down the little stream with our guns. There are
hours which live for ever in the memory&mdash;hours of
intense physical exhilaration, the pure wine of health
and youth, when the mind has no thoughts save for
the loveliness of earth, and the winds of morning stir
the blood to a heavenly fervour. No man who has
experienced such seasons can be other than an optimist.
Dull nights in cities, heartless labours with pen
and ink, the squalid worries of business and ambition,
all are forgotten, and in the retrospect it is those hours
which stand up like shining hill-tops&mdash;the type of the
pure world before our sad mortality had laid its spell
upon it. It is not pleasure&mdash;the word is too debased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
in human parlance; nor happiness, for that is for calm
delights. Call it joy, that &ldquo;enthusiasm&rdquo; which is
now the perquisite of creeds and factions, but which of
old belonged to the fauns and nymphs who followed
Pan&rsquo;s piping in the woody hollows of Thessaly. I
have known and loved many streams, but the little
Malmani has a high place in my affections. The
crystal water flowed out of great reed-beds into a
shallow vale, where it wound in pools and cataracts to
a broad ford below a ruined mill. Thence it passed
again into reed-beds fringed with willows and departed
from our ken. There was a bamboo covert opposite
full of small singing birds; the cries of snipe and plover
rose from the reed-beds, and the fall of water, rarest of
South African sounds, tinkled like steel in the cold
morning air. We shot nothing, for we saw nothing;
the glory of the scene was all that mortal eye could
hold at once. And then our waggons splashed through
the ford, and we had perforce to leave it.</p>

<p>We took a hill road, avoiding the detour by Malmani
Drift, and after some hours in a country of
wooded glens, came into the broad valley of the Klein
Marico. The high veld and its scenery had been left
far behind. Something half tropical, even in this mid-winter,
was in the air of those rich lowlands. After
the bleak uplands of Lichtenburg it was pleasant to
see good timber, the green of winter crops, and abundant
runnels of water. The farm-houses were larger
and in fair repair,&mdash;embowered, too, in orange-groves,
with the golden fruit bright among the glossy leaves.
Blossom was appearing in every orchard; new and
strange birds took the place of our enemy the korhaan;
and for the first time on our journey we saw buck on
the slopes. The vale was ringed with stony tree-clad
hills like the Riviera, and in the hot windless noon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
dust hung in clouds about us, so that, in spite of water
and greenery, my impression of that valley is one of
thirst and discomfort. Zeerust<a name="FNanchor_11_11"
id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> is
a pretty village
close under the hills, with tree-lined streets,&mdash;a prosperous
sleepy place, with no marks of the ravages of
war. The farmers, too, are a different stock from the
high-veld Boers; they get their living more easily, and
in their swarthy faces and slouching walk one cannot
read the hard-bitten spirit which inspired the men of
Botha and Delarey. They seemed on good terms with
their new masters. We attended a gymkhana given
by the South African Constabulary, and the Dutch
element easily predominated in the crowd which
watched the races. A good-humoured element, too,
for the men smoked and criticised the performances in
all friendliness, while their womenkind in their Sunday
clothes thronged to the marquees for tea.</p>

</div>

<h5>IV.</h5>

<p>The Rustenburg road runs due east through a fine
defile called Klein Marico Poort, and thence in a
country of thick bush for twenty miles to the ford of
the Groot Marico. We started before dawn, and did
not halt for breakfast till the said ford, by which time
the sun was high in the heavens and we were very hot,
dusty, and hungry. Lofty wooded hills rose to the
north, and not forty miles off lay the true hunting-veld,
with koodoo, water-buck, and hippopotamus. Bird
life was rich along the road&mdash;blue jays, rollers, and the
handsome malicious game-bird which acts as scout to
the guinea-fowl, and with his harsh call informs them
of human presence. The farms were small and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
richly watered, with laden orange-groves and wide
ruined verandahs. The people of Zeerust had spoken
with tears in their eyes of the beautiful condition of
this road, but we found it by far the worst in our
travels. It lay deep in sand, was strewn with ugly
boulders, and at one ford was so impossible that we
had to make a long detour over virgin veld. The
Great Marico, which, like all streams in the northern
watershed, joins the Limpopo, and indeed forms its
chief feeder, is a muddy tropical water, very unlike
the clear Malmani. Beyond it the country becomes
bare and pastoral again, full of little farms, to which
the bulk of the inhabitants had returned. It was the
most smiling country we had seen, for bush-veld has
an ineradicable air of barbarism, but a green open land
with white homesteads among trees is the true type
of a settled country. Apricot blossom lay like a soft
haze on the landscape. The young grass was already
springing in the sheltered places, the cold dusty winds
had gone, and a forehint of spring was in the calm
evening.</p>

<p>We spent the night above the Elands River, a very
beautiful full water, almost on the site of the battle.
The Elands River fight seems to have slipped from
the memory of a people who made much of lesser
performances; but to soldiers it is easily the Thermopylf
of the war. Five hundred or so of Australians
of different regiments, with a few Rhodesians, were
marching to join another force, when they were cut
off at Elands River by 3000 Boers. They were invited
to surrender, and declined. A small number took up
a position beside the stream; the remainder held a
little ridge in the centre of the amphitheatre of hills.
For several days they toiled at dug-outs&mdash;terrible
days, for they were shelled continually from the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
rim of the amphitheatre. One relieving force from
the west retired in despair; a relieving force from the
east was deceived by false heliograms, and went away,
believing the work accomplished. Then came the
report that they had surrendered; and then, after
some fifteen days, they were found by Lord Kitchener,
still holding the forlorn post. It was a mere sideshow,
but to have been there was worth half the
clasps in the campaign. More shells were fired into
that little place than into Mafeking, and the courage
of the few by the river who passed up water in the
night to their comrades is beyond praise. The Colonials
will long remember Elands River. It was their own
show: without generalship or orders, against all the
easy traditions of civilised warfare, the small band
followed the Berserker maxim, and vindicated the
ancient dignity of arms. In the morning we went
over the place. The dug-outs were still mostly intact,
and in a little graveyard beneath rude crosses slept
the heroic dead.</p>

<p>A few miles farther on and the summit of a ridge
was reached, from which the eye looked over a level
valley to the superb western line of the Magaliesberg.
Straight in front was the cleft of Magata&rsquo;s Nek,
beyond which Rustenburg lay. The western Magaliesberg
disappoints on closer acquaintance. The cliffs
prove to be mere loose kranzes, the glens are waterless,
the woods are nothing but barren thorn. But
seen from afar in the clear air of dawn, when the
darkness is still lurking in the hollows and the blue
peaks are flushed with sunrise, it is a fairyland picture,
a true mountain barrier to an enchanted land. Our
road swung down a long slope to the Coster River,
where we outspanned, and then through a sandy
wilderness to the drift of the Selons. From this it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
climbed wearily up to the throat of the nek, a dull
tract of country with few farms and no beauties. The
nek, too, on closer view has little to commend it, save
the prospect that opens on the other side. The level
green plateau of Rustenburg lay before us, bounded
on the north by a chain of kopjes, and on the south
by the long dark flanks of the Magaliesberg as it
sweeps round to the east. A few miles and the village
itself came in sight, with a great church, as at
Wakkerstroom, standing up like some simple rural
cathedral over the little houses. Rustenburg was
always the stronghold of the straitest sect of the
Boers; and in the midst of the half-tropical country
around, this sweep of pasture, crowned with a white
kirk, had something austere and Puritan in its air,&mdash;the
abode of a people with their own firm traditions,
hostile and masterful towards the world. The voortrekker
having fought his way through the Magaliesberg
passes, outspanned his tired oxen on this pleasant
upland, and called it his &ldquo;city of rest.&rdquo; And it still
looks its name, for no orchards and gardens can make
it otherwise than a novelty in the landscape&mdash;sober,
homely, and comforting, like some Old Testament
Elam where there were twelve wells of water
and three-score and ten palm-trees, or the &ldquo;plain
called Ease&rdquo; wherein Christian &ldquo;walked with much
content.&rdquo;</p>


<h5>V.</h5>

<p>We took up our quarters at a farm a little way
south of the town in the very shadow of the
mountains. It was a long, low, rambling house
called Boschdaal, with thick walls and cool passages.
All around were noble gum-trees; a clear stream
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
ran through the garden, which even at this season
was gay with tropical flowers; and the orchard was
heavy with oranges, lemons, and bananas. A little
conical hill behind had a path made to its summit,
whence one had a wide prospect of the Magaliesberg
and the whole plateau. There were sheer cliffs in
the background, with a waterfall among them; and
between them and the house were some miles of
park-like country where buck came in the morning.
The rooms were simply but pleasantly furnished; the
walls a forest of horns; and the bookcases full of
European classics, with a great abundance of German
story-books for children, telling how wicked Gretchen
amended her ways, or little Hans saved his pennies.
Altogether a charming dwelling-place, where a man
might well spend his days in worthy leisure, shooting,
farming, gardening, and smoking his pipe in the
evening, with the sunset flaming over the hills.</p>

<p>We spent two nights in Rustenburg, visiting in the
daytime a horse depot to which a number of brood
mares had been brought for winter grazing, and
paying our respects to a neighbouring chief, Magata,
who lives in a <i>stad</i> from which many town councils
might learn a lesson of cleanliness and order. The
natives are as rich as Jews from the war, owning fine
spans of oxen and Army Service Corps waggons, and
altogether disinclined to stir themselves for wages.
This prosperity of the lower race must be a bitter pill
for the Boer to swallow, as he drives in for his rations
with a team of wretched donkeys, and sees his former
servants with buck-waggons and cattle. We watched
strings of Burghers arriving at the depot, and at night
several fires in the neighbouring fields told of their
outspans. Most of them were polite and communicative:
a very few did their business in sulky silence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
There was one man who took my fancy. Originally
he must have been nearly seven feet high, but a
wound in the back had bent him double. He had
long black hair, and sombre black eyes which looked
straight before him into vacancy. He had a ramshackle
home-made cart and eight donkeys, and a
gigantic whip, of which he was a consummate master.
A small boy did his business for him, while he sat
hunched up on his cart speaking hoarsely to his
animals, and cracking his whip in the air,&mdash;a man
for whom the foundations of the world had been upset,
and henceforth, like Cain, a dweller apart.</p>

<p>On the third morning we started regretfully, for
Pretoria was only two days distant. This was the
pleasantest stage in our journey: the air was cool and
fine, the roads good, water abundant, and a noble
range of mountains kept us company. This is the
tobacco-land of the Transvaal, whence comes the
Magaliesberg brand, which has a high reputation in
South Africa. There are no big farms but a great
number of small holdings, richly irrigated and populous&mdash;the
stronghold of Mr Kruger in former times, for
he could always whistle his Rustenburgers to his will.
Now and then a pass cleft the mountain line on our
right, and in the afternoon we came in sight of the
great gap through which the Crocodile River forces
its passage. Farther east, and at a higher altitude,
lay Silikat&rsquo;s Nek, which is called after Mosilikatse.
It was approaching sunset as we crossed Commando
Nek, which is divided from Crocodile Poort by a spur
of mountain, and looked over the Witwatersberg
rolling south to the Rand and the feverish life of
cities. High up on a peak stood a castellated blockhouse,
looking like a peel tower in some old twilight
of Northumbrian hills, and to the left and right the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
precipitous cliffs of the Magaliesberg ran out to the
horizon. At the foot of the pass we forded the
Magalies River, a stream of clear water running over
a bed of grey-blue stones, and in another half-hour
we had crossed the bridge of the Crocodile and outspanned
on the farther bank.</p>

<p>The rivers unite a mile away, and the cleft of the
Poort to which the twin streams hurried stood out as
black as ink in the moonlight. Far up on the hillside
the bush was burning, and the glare made the gorge
like the gate of a mysterious world, guarded by flames
and shadows. This Poort is fine by daylight, but still
not more than an ordinary pass; but in the witching
half-light it dominated the mind like a wild dream.
After dinner we set out over the rough ground to
where a cliff sank sheer from the moonlight into utter
blackness. We heard the different notes of the two
rivers&mdash;the rapid Magalies and the sedater Crocodile;
and then we came to the bank of the united stream,
and scrambling along it found ourselves in the throat
of the pass. High walls of naked rock rose on either
hand, and at last, after some hard walking, we saw a
space of clear star-sown sky and the land beyond the
mountains. I had expected a brawling torrent; instead,
I found a long dark lagoon sleeping between
the sheer sides. In the profound silence the place
had the air of some underground world. The black
waters seemed to have drowsed there since the
Creation, unfathomably deep&mdash;a witch&rsquo;s caldron, where
the savage spirits of the hills might show their faces.
Even as we gazed the moon came over the crest: the
cliff in front sprang into a dazzling whiteness which
shimmered back from the lagoon below. Far up on
the summit was a great boulder which had a far-away
likeness to an august human head. As the light fell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
on it the resemblance became a certainty: there were
the long locks, the heavy brows, the profound eyes of
a colossal Jove. Not Jove indeed, for he was the god
of a race, but that elder deity of the natural man,
grey-haired Saturn, keeping his ageless vigil, quiet as
a stone, over the generations of his children. Forgotten
earth-dwellers, Mosilikatse and his chiefs, Boer
commandos, British yeomanry,&mdash;all had passed before
those passionless eyes, as their successors will pass and
be forgotten. And in the sense of man&rsquo;s littleness
there is comfort, for it is part of the title of our inheritance.
The veld and the mountains continue for
ever, austerely impartial to their human occupants:
it is for the new-comer to prove his right to endure by
the qualities which nature has marked for endurance.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<h4>THE WOOD BUSH.</h4>

<p>Some thirty miles east of Pietersburg, the most
northerly railway station in the Transvaal, the Leydsdorp
coach, which once a-week imperils the traveller&rsquo;s
life, climbs laboriously into a nest of mountains, and
on the summit enters an upland plateau, with shallow
valleys and green forest-clad slopes. Twenty miles on
and the same coach, if it has thus far escaped destruction,
precipitously descends a mountain-side into the
fever flats which line the Groot Letaba and the Letsitela.
The Leydsdorp road thus cuts off a segment of
a great irregular oblong, which is bounded on the
south by the spurs of the Drakensberg, which the Boers
call the Wolkberg or Mountain of Cloud, and on the
north divided by the valley of the Klein Letaba from
the Spelonken. It is a type of country found in
patches in the de Kaap mountains, and in parts of
Lydenburg; but here it exists in a completely defined
territory of perhaps 700 square miles, divided sharply
from high veld and bush veld. The average elevation
may be 5000 feet, and, though cut up into valleys
and ridges, it preserves the attributes of a tableland,
so that on all sides one can journey to an edge and
look down upon a wholly different land. But the geographical
is the least of its distinctions. The climate
has none of the high-veld dryness or the low-veld
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
closeness, but is humid and sharp and wholesome all
the year round. Mists and cool rains abound, every
hollow has its stream, and yet frost is rarely known.
Its vegetation, the configuration of its landscape, the
soil itself, are all things by themselves in South Africa.
Fever, horse-sickness, and most cattle diseases are unknown.
It is little explored, for till quite lately the
native tribes were troublesome, and only the poorer
class of Boer squatted on its occupation farms, and,
though a proclaimed gold-field for some years, the
uitlander who strayed there had rarely an eye for its
beauty. The unfortunate man who took his life in his
hands and journeyed by coach to Leydsdorp forgot the
landscape in the perils of the journey, and in all likelihood
forgot most things in fever at the end of it. It
remained, therefore, a paradise with a few devotees, a
place secret and strange, with a beauty so peculiar that
the people who tried to describe it were rarely believed.
A delight in the Wood Bush is apt to spoil a man for
other scenery. The high veld seems tame and monotonous,
the bush veld an intolerable desert, and even
the mountain glories of the Drakensberg something
crude and barbarous after this soft, rich, and fascinating
garden-land.</p>

<p>The mountains come into view a little way from
Pietersburg, but there are many miles of featureless
high veld to be covered before the foothills are reached.
It was midsummer when I first travelled there, and
the dusty waterless plains were glazed by the hot
sun. The Sand River, filled with acres of fine sand,
but not a drop of moisture, was not a cooling object
in the scene, and the dusty thorn scrub offered no
shade. But insensibly the country changed. Bold
kopjes of rose-red granite appeared on the plain, and
at a place called Kleinfontein the road turned sharply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
south, and we were confronted with a noble line of
crags running out like a buttress from the mountains.
At Smith&rsquo;s Drift the road swerved east again, and a
long valley appeared before us running up into the
heart of the hills. A clear stream came down it, and
the sides were dotted in bush-veld manner with redwood
and sikkelboom and syringa, and a variety of
thorns, of which the Kaffir waak-en-beetje and the
knopjes-doorn were the prettiest. Occasionally the
dull green of the olivienhout appeared, and when the
bush ceased aloes raised their heads among the rocks.
Everywhere the mimosa was in bloom, and the afternoon
air was laden with a scent like limes. Towards
the top the valley flattened out into upland meadows,
little farms appeared dotted on the hillsides, and the
yellow mimosa blossom on the slopes was so indistinguishable
from gorse that in the half-light I could
have sworn I was among Cumberland fells, and not
on the edge of the tropics and 300 miles from the sea.
We assisted a Boer farmer to slay a pig, had coffee
afterwards with his family, and slept the sleep of the
just on a singularly hard piece of ground under a
magnificent sky of stars, being roused once to give a
drink to a belated member of the S.A.C.</p>

<p>Shortly after dawn next day we toiled to the top
of a long hill, and entered the Wood Bush. A high
blue ridge&mdash;the Iron Crown mountain behind Haenertsburg&mdash;rose
before us, which changed with the
full light to a dazzling green, studded in the kloofs
with patches of dark forest. Glimpses of other forest-crowned
hills appeared in the turnings of the path;
and when we had exhausted the horizon we had time
to look at the roadside. It was a perfectly new
country. The soil was as red as Devonshire, the
steep sides oozed with little runnels of water. Thickly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
grassed meadows of the same dazzling yet delicate
green fell away to the little hollows, where copses
took their place, and now and then a small red farm
showed in a group of alien gum-trees. It was so
novel as to be almost unbelievable. And then in the
meadows little shrubs like dwarf hazels appeared,
which on closer view showed themselves as tree-ferns,&mdash;old
gnarled veterans and young graceful saplings.
The herbage, too, was gay with flowers, as gay as an
English meadow save that for daisies there were
patches of tall arums and lilies, and for buttercups a
superb golden-belled campanula. I am no botanist
and am not ashamed of it, but on that morning I
regretted a wasted youth and many unprofitable
hours given to the classics. By-and-by we descended
on the little township of Haenertsburg, a cluster of
rondhavels and the tents of an S.A.C. post. On leaving
we crossed a torrent, the Bruderstroom, which
later becomes the Groot Letaba and flows through
miles of feverish deserts to join the Olifants and
thence to the Limpopo. It was a true highland
stream, with deep dark-blue pools, and great swirls
of icy grey water sweeping round crags or stretching
out into glistening shallows. On the high veld it
would be dignified by the name of river, and be shorn
and parcelled into a thousand water-furrows. But
here it was but one of many, for every hollow had its
limpid stream slipping out of sight among the tall
grasses.</p>

<p>Beyond Haenertsburg the Iron Crown mountain
comes into full view, with its green sides scarred and
blackened in places with the works of gold-seekers.
To the left rose the crags of the Wolkberg, and far
behind the blue lines of the Drakensberg itself. To
the north the true Wood Bush country appeared, an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
endless park laid out as if by a landscape gardener,
with broad dales set with coppices, and little wood-covered
hills. &ldquo;A park-like country,&rdquo; is the common
travellers&rsquo; phrase for the bush veld; but there the
grass is rank and ugly, the trees isolated thorns, and
the whole land flat and waterless. Here was a true
park, like Chatsworth or Windsor, so perfectly laid
out that one could scarcely believe that it was not a
work of man. For surely a park is properly man&rsquo;s
work, a flower of civilisation, which nature aids but
rarely contrives. Yet when she does contrive, how
far is the result beyond our human skill! For an
exception the mountain-tops were free from mist;
the land lay bathed in a cool morning light, and
the scent of a thousand aromatic herbs&mdash;wormwood,
southernwood, a glorified bog-myrtle, musk, and peppermint&mdash;rose
from the wayside. Bracken was as
plentiful as on a Scots moor, and the old familiar
fragrance was like a breath of the sea. We breakfasted
in a water-meadow, where a spring of cold
water stole away through a forest of tree-ferns,
arums, giant orchises, and the tall blue agapanthus.
As we smoked our morning pipes and watched a
white eagle and a brace of berghaans circling in the
blue, I vowed that here at last had been found the
true Hesperides.</p>

<p>A few miles on and we were on the farther edge.
At a place called Skellum Kloof the road dips sharply
over the crest, and down three break-neck miles to
the Groot Letaba. Behind lay the green garden-land;
in front, a hundred miles of broken country, fading
in the far distance into misty flats. The little range of
the Murchison hills ran out at right angles; away to
the north the peaks of Majajie&rsquo;s mountains, with the
Spelonken beyond, blocked the horizon. As far as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
eye could see, the faint blue line of the Rooi Rand,
the Portuguese border, was just distinguishable from
the sky, with the fingers of the little Lebombo breaking
the thin line to the south. One forgot the weary
miles of swamp and fever that lay between, and saw
only a glorious sunlit plain, which might have been
full of clear rivers and vineyards and white cities,
instead of thorn and Kaffir huts and a few ugly mining
shanties. The Wood Bush on its eastern side is a
series of soft green folds, with the superb evergreen
forest in every kloof. At first sight the woods look
like hazel copses, and you plunge gaily in to your disaster.
Below Skellum Kloof is a little wooded glen,
into which I descended for water, and at one time
there were doubts of my ever emerging again. The
place was matted with monkey-creepers, mosses, huge
ferns, and a thick undergrowth around the trunks
of great trees. Yellowwoods, 200 feet high, essenwood,
sneezewood, stinkwood, most of them valuable
timber-trees, and all with a glossy dark foliage, rose
out of the jungle to the confusion of the poor inhabitant
below. I noticed some giant royals, some
curious orchids, and quantities of maidenhair fern and
the graceful asparagus creeper. But soon I noticed
little beyond the exceeding toilsomeness of the passage.
Every step had to be fought for, the place was
hot to suffocation, and I was in mortal fear of snakes.
Also, I had no desire to meet a bushbuck ram, than
whom no fiercer fellow for his size exists, at close
quarters in his native haunts. I kept down-hill,
listening for water, and by-and-by rolled over a red
scaur into an ice-cold pool, which was the only pleasing
thing in the forest. Happily in returning I struck a
native path, and reached open country in greater
comfort. Two boys who had been sent to find me&mdash;Basutos,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
and, like all Basutos, fools in a thick wood&mdash;
succeeded in getting lost themselves, and had to be
searched for.</p>

<p>Hereabouts, when my ship comes home, I shall
have my country house. There is a piece of flat
land, perhaps six acres square, from which a long
glen runs down to the Letaba. There I shall have
my dwelling. In front there will be a park to put
England to shame, miles of rolling green dotted with
shapely woods, and in the centre a broad glade in
which a salmon-river flows in shallows and falls among
tree-ferns, arums, and bracken. There may be a lake,
but I am undecided. In front I shall have a flower-garden,
where every temperate and tropical blossom
will appear, and in a sheltered hollow an orchard
of deciduous trees, and an orange plantation. Highland
cattle, imported at incredible expense, will roam
on the hillsides. My back windows will look down
4000 feet on the tropics, my front on the long
meadow vista with the Iron Crown mountain for
the sun to set behind. My house will be long and
low, with broad wings, built of good stone and whitewashed,
with a thatched roof and green shutters, so
that it will resemble a <i>prazo</i> such as some Portuguese
seigneur might have dwelt in in old times. Within
it will be cool and fresh, with stone floors and big
fireplaces, for the mists are chill and the winds can
blow sharply on the mountains. There will be good
pictures and books, and quantities of horns and skins.
I shall grow my own supplies, and make my own
wine and tobacco. Rides will be cut in the woods,
and when my friends come to stay we shall drive
bushbuck and pig, and stalk tiger-cats in the forest.
There will be wildfowl on my lake, and Lochleven
trout in my waters. And whoever cares to sail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
5000 miles, and travel 1500 by train, and drive 50
over a rough road, will find at the end of his journey
such a palace as Kubla Khan never dreamed of. The
accomplishment is difficult, but not, I trust, impossible.
Once upon a time, as the story goes, a Dutchman
talked with a predikant about the welfare of his
soul. &ldquo;You will assuredly be damned,&rdquo; said the
predikant, &ldquo;and burn in hell.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said the
Dutchman. &ldquo;If I am so unfortunate as to get in
there, I shall certainly get out again.&rdquo; &ldquo;But that
is folly and an impossibility,&rdquo; said the predikant.
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the other with confidence, &ldquo;wait and
see: I shall make a plan.&rdquo; <i>Ek sal &rsquo;n plan maak</i>&mdash;this
must be my motto, and I shall gratefully accept
all honourable suggestions.</p>

<p>The country is full of wealth&mdash;mines, agriculture,
forestry, and pasturage. The presence of payable
gold, both in quartz and banket, is undoubted, and
some improvement in the roads, possibly a light
railway, and the completion of the Selati line may
provide for the rise of Haenertsburg from a very
little dorp into a flourishing township. There is
magnificent pasturage for stock, for cattle diseases
are few and horse-sickness is unknown. It has been
said that one acre in the Wood Bush will carry an
ox, and though this is an exaggeration, it is certain
that the rich herbage will maintain three or four
times the head of stock which can be run on the
high veld. The grass in spring is very early, and
in the worst part of winter the forests can be resorted
to, so that hand-feeding is almost unknown.
The grass is sour veld, but any extensive pasturing
would soon bring it into the sweet veld class. Once
it were properly grazed down, it would be also a
natural sheep country of high value. The soil is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
a clayey red loam, and the moist climate provides
perfect conditions for most seed crops. Tobacco would
thrive well&mdash;as well perhaps as on the lower slopes
along the Groot Letaba, where Mr Altenroxel produces
excellent pipe tobacco and a respectable cigar.
It is a paradise for vegetables, and all hardy fruits
and a few sub-tropical ones could be made to flourish
in the rich straths. It is a land for small holdings,
save for a few larger farms on the hill-tops, and
here might arise a community of British settlers,
making a new England out of a country which
already possesses the climate of the West Highlands
and the configuration of a Sussex park.</p>

<p>At Skellum Kloof we descended from the uplands
to an elevation of about 2000 feet, a type of scenery
half-way between the wholesome high veld and the
pernicious flats of the Lower Letaba. I take that
descent to be all but the worst in the Transvaal,
second only to the appalling cliff over which the road
from Lydenburg drops to the Olifants. The grades
are so steep that with a waggon it is necessary to
outspan all animals but the two wheelers, and lock
the wheels tightly. With a two-wheeled Cape cart
to attempt it is to court destruction. Just at the
foot is an awesome corner, and then a straight slope
to the Letaba, a stream about the size of the Spean
and not unlike it. There is a fine salmon pool below
the ford, in which I swam circumspectly, being in
dread of stray crocodiles. The valley has nothing
of that raw unfinished look so common in South
African landscapes. The peaks rise in noble contours
from long stretches of forest and Kaffir tillage. As
we crossed, the mist drooped over the hills and we
ascended the far side to our camp in a heavy persistent
rain. The whole country was full of crying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
waters, and but for the clumps of wild bananas and
the indescribable African smell, we might have been
climbing to a Norwegian saeter after a long day&rsquo;s
fishing.</p>

<p>All night it rained in torrents, and next morning&mdash;New
Year&rsquo;s Day&mdash;dawned in the same driving misty
weather. We could not see twenty yards, and the
long sloppy grass and thick red mud of the roads made
bad going even for Afrikander ponies. We sent our
heavy transport back, and, carrying little more than
a dry shirt and a toothbrush, struck down a track
which follows the eastern ridge of the valley. The
vegetation was as dense as any jungle, and swishing
through the reeds and ducking the low branches of
trees soaked us to the skin in a few minutes. But in
spite of discomfort it was a fascinating ride. The
heavy tropical scents which the rain brought out of
the ground, the intense silence of the drooping mists
and water-laden forests, the clusters of beehive Kaffir
huts in the hollows, all made up a world strange and
new to the sight and yet familiar to the imagination.
This was the old Africa of a boy&rsquo;s dream, and there is
no keener delight than to realise an impression of
childhood. Yet, though the air blew sharp, there
was something unwholesome in it. Fever lurked
in the comely glens, and the clear reaches of the
Letaba were not the honest, if scanty, waters of
the high veld. The pungent penetrating smell
of the herbs we trod underfoot had an uncanniness
in it as if all were simples and antidotes&mdash;a
faint medicinal flavour like the ante-chamber of a
physician.</p>

<p>Krabbefontein, which we reached at mid-day, is a
very beautiful clearing in the woods on the left bank
of the river and at the foot of the Machubi glen. Mr
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Altenroxel, the owner, farms on a large scale, and has
long been famous for his tropical produce. The
luxuriance of the growth is so great as almost to
pass belief. Gum-trees grow from 10 to 15 feet in
a year; and we saw a bamboo fully 50 feet high
whose age was under two years. Huge drying-sheds
for tobacco, numerous well-built outhouses and cottages,
wholly the work of natives, and a few rondhavels
made up the farm-steading. The time was
past for apricots, but the orchard was full of grenadillas,
finest of South African fruit, and kei apples;
grapes were plentiful; and in a field of pines we
destroyed the remnants of our digestion. The owner
remained on his farm throughout the war, growing
his own supplies, which included tea, sugar, and coffee.
His tobacco is the finest brand of Transvaal pipe-tobacco
I have smoked, and he exports to the
towns boxes of light-flavoured but pleasant cigars,
making everything on the farm except the labels.
I have rarely seen native workers so intelligent and
industrious, and the whole place leaves an impression
of strenuous and enlightened toil. In the bungalow
we ate our New Year&rsquo;s dinner, washed down by excellent
German beer, carried many miles across the hills.
If the conversation at table approached the domain
of fact at all, the neighbourhood is full of uncanny
things. A disgusting variety of tarantula, whose
bite means death in half an hour, has his home
around the tobacco-sheds; puff-adders abound; and
the week before our visit a black mamba had attacked
and killed a young Dutch girl. We heard, too,
many tales of the eastern hunting-veld, and in the
huge dark spaces beyond the rafters we saw the
shadowy trophies of former hunting trips.</p>

<p>At daybreak next morning, in a thick drizzle, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
started to reascend the mountains. A Kaffir set us
on our way, and soon the hills closed in and we were
in the long glen of Machubi. Machubi was a Kaffir
chief with whom the Boers waged one of their many
and most inglorious little wars. When his people
were scattered he took refuge in the thick forest at
the head of the river which bears his name. After
my experience of that kind of forest I do not wonder
that the Boers preferred not to fight a hand-to-hand
battle in its tangled depths. So, after their fashion,
they hired an impi of Swazis, who sat around the
wood for three weeks, and ultimately slew the chief&mdash;not,
however, before he had accounted in single-handed
combat for three of his enemies. Mr Altenroxel
possesses the old warrior&rsquo;s skull, which, except
for the great thickness at the crown of the head, is
finely shaped, and all but Caucasian in its lines. For
this glen of Machubi I have nothing but praise: high
bush-clad mountains, grey corries, streaked with white
waterfalls, a limpid hill-stream, and in the flats green
patches of Kaffir tillage. But the road&mdash;which once
was a coach-road!&mdash;is pure farce. If there is a
peculiarly tangled piece of scrub it dives into it, a
really awkward rock and it ascends it, an unfordable
reach of an easy stream and it makes straight for it,
a swamp and it leads you into the deepest and direst
part. We had constantly to dismount and coax our
ponies down and up impossible steeps. My little
African stallion as a rock-climber was not at his
best, and I had some awkward positions to get him
out of. One in particular remains in my memory. A
very deep river could only be crossed by standing on
a stone, leaping to an old log, and thence with a final
sprawl to the farther bank. I turned my reins into
a halter, went in front, and tried to coax my pony.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
When at last he did it he all but landed on my
chest, and I made the acquaintance of the hardness
of every one of his bones before I got him out of
the valley.</p>

<p>The road climbs a spur in the fork of two streams,
and as one ascends and looks up the narrow twin
glens, the old exquisite green of the true Wood Bush
takes the place of the sadder colours of the lowlands.
The heads of the glens have the form of what are
called in the north of England and Scotland &ldquo;hopes,&rdquo;
rounded green cup-shaped hollows; only here all things
are on a larger scale, and the evergreen forest takes
the place of birch and juniper in the corries. The
road wound through wood and bracken, now coming
out clear on a knoll, and now sinking to the level of
some little stream. The mist which had covered the
mountains was clearing, and one after another the
green summits came forth like jewels against the pale
morning sky. The tropical scents ceased, the sun
shone out, and suddenly we were on the neck of the
pass with a meadow-land country falling away from
our feet. It was still hazy, but as we breakfasted the
foreground slowly cleared. Little white roads sped
away over the shoulders of hill; a rushing stream
appeared in a hollow with one noble waterfall. Still
the landscape opened; wood after wood came into
being, glistening like emeralds in the dawn; long
sweeps of pasture, each with its glimpse of water,
carried the eye to where the great Drakensberg, blue
and distant, was emerging from the fleecy mists of
morning. Once more we were in the enchanted
garden-land.</p>

<p>It is easy to describe the awesome and the immense,
but it is hard indeed to convey an adequate impression
of exceeding charm and richness. Hard, at least,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
in dull prose. A line of gleaming poetry, such as
Herrick&rsquo;s&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>will convey more of the true and intimate charm than
folios of elaborated description. The main feature of
the place is its sharp distinction from the common
South African landscape. The high veld with its vast
spaces, the noble mountain ravines, the flats of the
bush veld, have all their own charm; but the traveller
is plagued with the something unfriendly and austere
in their air, as if all thought of human life had been
wanting in their creation. They are built on a scale
other than ours; man&rsquo;s labour has in the last resort
no power to change them. They remain rough, unfinished,
eternally strange, a country to admire, but
scarcely to adopt and understand. But this garden-ground
is wholly human. Natura Benigna was the
goddess who presided at its creation, and no roughness
enters into the &ldquo;warm, green-muffled&rdquo; slopes,
the moist temperate weather, and the limpid waters.
It is England, richer, softer, kindlier, a vast demesne
laid out as no landscape gardener could ever contrive,
waiting for a human life worthy of such an environment.
But it is more&mdash;it is that most fascinating of
all types of scenery, a garden on the edge of a wilderness.
And such a wilderness! Over the brink of the
meadow, four thousand feet down, stretch the steaming
fever flats. From a cool fresh lawn you look clear
over a hundred miles of nameless savagery. The first
contrast which fascinates the traveller is between the
common veld and this garden; but the deeper contrast,
which is a perpetual delight to the dweller,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
is between his temperate home and the rude wilds
beyond his park wall.</p>

<p>What is to be the fate of it? There is no reason
why it should not become at once a closely settled
farming country. If the Pietersburg line is looped
round between Magatoland and the Spelonken and
brought south to meet a line from Leydsdorp, this
intervening plateau will have a ready access to
markets. The place, too, may become a famous
sanatorium, to which the worried town-dwellers
may retire to recover health from the quiet greenery.
Country houses may spring up, and what is now the
preserve of a few enthusiasts may become in time the
Simla or Saratoga of the Transvaal. How much, I
wonder, will the new-comers see of its manifold graces?
Any one can appreciate the mellow air, the restful
water-meadows, the profound stillness of the deep-bosomed
hills. These are physical matters, making
a direct appeal to the simpler senses. But for the
rest? It is the place for youth, youth with high
spirit and wide horizon, sensitive to scenery and
weather, loving wild nature and adventure for their
own noble sakes. How much, I wonder, will they see
of it all&mdash;the people who have the purse to compass
health resorts and the constitutions to need them? For
here, as in all places of subtle and profound beauty,
there is need of the seeing eye and the understanding
heart.</p>

I do not think that the place will ever become staled.
The special correspondent will not rhapsodise over it&mdash;he
will find many places better worthy of his
genius; the voice of the halfpenny paper will not,
I think, be heard in that land. Its appeal is at once
too obvious and too subtle: too obvious in its main
features to please the common connoisseur, too subtle
and remote for the wayfaring man to penetrate. It
will remain, I trust, the paradise of a few&mdash;a paradise
none the less their own because towns and hotels and
country houses may have sprung up throughout it.
To such it will always appear (as it appeared to us
when we took farewell of it from the summit above
Haenertsburg and saw the hills and glades sleeping
in the mellow afternoon) an old-world Arcadia, a lost
classic land which Nature with her artist&rsquo;s humour
has created in this raw unstoried Africa.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<h4>ON THE EASTERN VELD.</h4>

<p>Machadodorp, that straggling village called after
a Portuguese commander, is the most easterly outpost
of the high veld. A few miles farther and there
is a sheer fall into narrow mountain glens, down which
the Elands River and the Delagoa Bay Railway make
the best of their way to the lowlands. North lies the
hill country of Lydenburg, to which the traveller may
come in a coach after a day of heart-breaking hills
and neck-breaking descents. But south for a good
hundred miles sweeps the high veld in a broad promontory
from Machadodorp to the Pongola, and on
the east to the Swaziland border. It is the highest
part of the great central tableland, and a very bleak
dwelling-place in winter; but in summer and autumn
it has a full share of the curious veld beauty. In
particular, being in the line of the Drakensberg, you
can come to its edge and look over into the wild
tangle of glens which lie between you and the
Lebombo hills. Also it is the lake district of South
Africa, being full of tarns of all sizes from Lake
Chrissie, which is a respectable sheet of water, to
the tiniest reed-filled pan. It is the coldest, freshest,
and windiest part of the land, a tonic country where
the inhabitants are rarely ill, and few doctors can
make a living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
The journey to the first outspan from Machadodorp
on the Ermelo road is a little monotonous, for you are
not yet on the ridge of the high veld, the grass is
rank, and the landscape featureless. You are pursued,
too, by an unfinished railway, the Machadodorp-Carolina
line, and if there is an uglier thing than
the raw scar made by earthworks and excavations
and uncompleted culverts, I do not know it. The line
is being taken over by Government, and the sooner
it is laid the better, for at present the richest farming
population in the Transvaal are some sixty miles from
a rail-head. At the fine stone bridge of the Komati
you enter a more pleasing country, with a glimpse to
the east of a gap in the hills through which the river
enters the broken country. The Komati here is a
slow high-veld stream creeping through long muddy
pools with the slenderest of currents, but some eight
miles down it is a hill torrent. This is one of the
paradoxes of the high-veld rivers. Elsewhere it is
in their cradle that streams have their &ldquo;bright
speed&rdquo;; here the infant river must be content to
creep like a canal, and lo! when it is almost full
grown, it finds itself hurled in cataracts down a
mountain valley. Who, seeing the Olifants near
Middelburg, can ever believe that it is the same
stream which swirls round a corner of the berg north
of Ohrigstad; or, watching the sluggish Umpilusi
crawling through the high veld, find any kinship
between it and the Swaziland salmon-river? It is
a romantic career&mdash;first a chain of half-stagnant
pools, then a cataract, and then a full-grown river,
rolling its yellow waters through leagues of bush and
jungle to the tropical ocean.</p>

<p>From Everard&rsquo;s store, which is a pleasant outspan
among trees, the road climbs steeply to the ridge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the country. A tremendous sweep of veld comes into
view, stretching to the west in hazy leagues till the
eyes dazzle with the soft contours and infinite lines,
and in the east barred at a great distance by a faint
blue range, the Ingwenya Mountains. The first pan
appeared, no larger than an English mill-dam, and
overgrown with reeds which made a patch of darker
green against the veld. One had the sensation of
being somewhere on the roof of the world, for on
every horizon but one the land sloped to a lower
altitude, and even on the east the mountains seemed
foreshortened, like the masts of a vessel just coming
into sight at sea. Presently a little white dorp,
Carolina, appeared some miles away on the left, with
that curious look of a Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress village which
so many veld townships possess. Then miles on miles
of the same green downland, the road now sinking
into little valleys with a glimpse of farm-steadings,
and now holding the ridge in the centre of the amphitheatre.
As the autumn evening fell, and the soft
lights bathed the landscape, it became a spectral world,
a Tir-an-Oig, in which it was difficult to believe that
this rose-coloured slope was not a dream or that
purple clump of trees a mirage. Little lochs appeared,
some olive-green with rushes, some cold and black
with inky waves lapping on dazzling white shores.
Water, in Novalis&rsquo; quaint fancy, is as the eye to a
landscape, the one thing generally lacking in the
blind infinity of the veld. Strings of wild-geese
passed over our heads, and from the meadow bottoms
there came the call of ducks and now and then the
bark of a korhaan. Curious echoes arose as we
passed, for there is something in the geological
structure of the country which makes it full of eerie
noises. And then, as darkness closed down, a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
piece of water appeared, beyond which rose a little
hill with two woods of blue gum and a light between
them. A nearer view showed a trim cottage, with
Kaffir huts around it, the beginnings of a garden,
and, even in the dusk, a glimpse of long lines of
crops stretching down to the lake. It was the homestead
of Florence, which stands on the apex of a large
block of Crown land, and is used as the headquarters
of the land commissioner of the eastern district.</p>

<p>From Florence to the Swaziland border is some
fifty miles as the crow flies, so at dawn our horses were
saddled, and, with a mule-cart for provisions, we set
out towards the remote hills. The morning had begun
in a Scots mist, but by ten o&rsquo;clock the sky was cloudless,
and the intense blue of the lakes, the white shores,
and the many patches of marl on the slopes caught
the sun with a bewildering glare. The water in the
pans is generally brackish, but some few are fresh, and
one in particular, about four miles long, has wooded
islets and a bold white bluff like a chalk cliff. The
names are mostly Scots&mdash;Blairmore, Ardentinny,
Hamilton,&mdash;for the land was first bought and settled
by a Glasgow company. They are almost all stock
farms, with little irrigation except along the Umpilusi;
and many are fenced, efficiently enough, with slabs of
stone for uprights. On one farm, Lake Banagher, we
rode past a herd of some 300 or 400 blesbok and
springbok, which are preserved by Mr Schalk Meyer,
the owner. About noon we came into the shallow vale
of the Umpilusi, and left it again for a high ridge,
whence all afternoon we had a view of rolling country
to the south, with the Slaangaapies mountains on the
horizon. The great hills in the north of Swaziland
were faint but clear, though we were still too high
ourselves to see them to advantage. The country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
began to change, the valleys became almost glens, a
great deal of tumbled rock appeared overgrown with
bush and bracken, and everything spoke of the beginnings
of a mountain country, which, strangely enough,
we were approaching from above. In the late afternoon
we came to large belts of trees around a ruined
farmhouse, and as the sky was beginning to threaten
we outspanned for the night. We were not more than
half a dozen miles from the Swazi border and in full
sight of it&mdash;a chain of little kopjes with a hint of
faint mountains behind.</p>

<p>The farmhouse was an odd place seen in that stormy
dusk. Thick woods of blue-gum and pine surrounded
it, and below, also hemmed in by trees, was a lush
water-meadow. The house had been a substantial
stone building, but it was stripped to the walls, every
scrap of woodwork having been used by the troops for
fuel. The broken stoep was overgrown with moon-flowers,
whose huge white blossoms gleamed uncannily
in the shadows. We pushed through the wood and
the overgrown paddock to a neglected orchard, where
the fruit-trees had lost all semblance of their former
selves, and struggled vainly among creepers and high
grasses, and thence to the meadow where a little
reddish stream trickled through the undergrowth.
Owls flitted about like the ghosts of the place, and
this relic of war with its moated-grange melancholy
had a depressing effect on our spirits. We gladly
sought our camp in an old barn on higher ground,
where a blazing fire restored us to cheerfulness. The
rain never fell, and the morning dawned grey and
misty, so that when we set out for the border we had
little hope of a view. We passed some Swazi kraals,
and got directions from their picturesque occupants.
The men are active and tall, and their wives with their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
curious head-dresses are better to look at than the
sluttish native women of the central districts. They
are beautiful dancers, and the performance of a body
of Swazis in war costume is a thing to remember.
The country began to be extremely rocky, and tree-ferns
and other specimens of sub-tropical vegetation
appeared in the hollows. One glossy-leaved bush bore
a berry about the size and shape of a rasp, called by
the natives &ldquo;infanfaan,&rdquo; which had an agreeable sub-acid
flavour. A little hill, looking as if it were made
of one single gigantic boulder, appeared on the right,
and with some scrambling we got our horses to the
foot of it. This was Bell&rsquo;s Kop, a famous landmark,
and beyond and below was Swaziland.</p>

<p>The morning had cleared, and though the horizons
were misty, we saw enough to reward us. The ground
fell sharply away from our feet to a green glen studded
with trees, down which a white road wound. A hill
shut the glen, but over the hill and at a much lower
altitude we saw the strath of the Umpilusi, with the
river running in wide sweeps with shores of gravel,
not unlike the Upper Spey as seen from the Grampians.
Beyond were tiers of broken blue hills, rising very
high towards the north, where they culminate in Piggs&rsquo;
Peak, but fading southward into a misty land where
lay the Lebombo flats. The grey soft air had an
intense stillness, a kind of mountain melancholy, but
far to the south there was a patch of sunlight on the
green hills above Amsterdam. It is a type of view
which can be had in all parts of the Drakensberg,
from Mont aux Sources frowning over Natal to the
Spelonken looking down on the plains of the Letaba&mdash;a
view to me of infinite charm, for you stand upon the
dividing line between two forms of country and two
climates, looking back upon the endless prairies and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
their fresh winds and forward upon warm glens and
the remote malarial tropics.</p>

<p>From Bell&rsquo;s Kop we fetched a wide circuit, going
to Amsterdam, which was not more than fifteen miles
from where we stood, by Florence and Ermelo, a
journey of over 100 miles. The afternoon ride was
something to remember, for the day had cleared into a
bright afternoon with cool winds blowing, and the
green ridges had a delicate pastoral beauty, as of sunlit
sheep-walks. When we forded the Umpilusi its
sluggish pools were glowing with the fires of sunset.
Cantering in the hazy twilight of the long slopes was
pure romance, and the sounds from a Kaffir kraal, the
slow mild-eyed oxen on the road, and the wheeling of
wild birds had all the strangeness of things seen and
heard in a dream. I know no such tonic for the
spirits, for in such a scene and at such a time the
blood seems to run more freely in the veins, the mind
to be purged from anxious indolence, and the whole
nature to become joyous and receptive. Much comes
from the air. There is something in those spaces of
clear absolute ether, eternally wide, fresh as spring
water, pure as winds among snow, which not only
sustains but vitalises and rejuvenates the body.
There is something, too, in the life. Fine scenery is
too often witnessed by men when living the common
life of civilisation and enjoying the blessings of a good
cook and a not indifferent cellar. But on the veld
there is bare living and hard riding, so that a man
becomes thin and hard and very much alive, the dross
of ease is purged away, and body and mind regain the
keen temper which is their birthright.</p>

<p>We outspanned at a Boer farm and dined with the
family off home-made bread, <i>confyt</i>, and tea. They
were very hospitable and friendly, and discussed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
war and current politics with all freedom. The walls
were adorned with numerous portraits of <em>British</em>
generals; and the farmer, who had been in Bermuda,
displayed with much pride the carvings with which
he had beguiled his captivity. One of the sons read
assiduously a Dutch translation of one of Mayne
Reid&rsquo;s novels, and when he could tear himself from
the narrative contributed to the talk some details of
his commando-life under Ben Viljoen, for whom, in
common with most of the younger Dutch, he had a
profound admiration. These people are a strange
mixture&mdash;so hospitable, that the traveller is ashamed
to go near a Boer farm, seeing the straitness of their
lives and the generosity with which they give what
they have; and yet so squalid that they make little
effort to better their condition. This particular farmer
owned four large farms, worth in the present market
not less than #20,000; the sale of one or a part of
one would have given him ample means to buy stock
and start again. But he was content to go on as he
was, running up a long bill with the Repatriation
depot, and grumbling at the high prices for stock compared
with what he had been used to pay. The
result was that, though he had been back for nine
months, I saw no living thing on that farm but a few
chickens, six goats, and a spavined horse.</p>

<p>We made the last stage to Florence shortly after sunrise,
and arrived at the homestead in time for breakfast.
The twenty odd miles to Ermelo were the easy journey
of an afternoon. We passed the ruined township
of Chrissie, with a roofless kirk and some flourishing
plantations of firs. The lake itself lay over some
meadows, a pear-shaped piece of water, very shallow,
and at its greatest perhaps some six or eight miles
round. Yet in spite of its shallowness there is ample
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
depth for a small centre-board; and when the railway
is completed and Chrissie becomes a summer sanatorium,
there is no reason why a modest kind of
yachting should not be enjoyed. For the rest it is a
bare road, with outcrops of coal appearing here and
there, and the infant Vaal to be crossed, a very mean
and muddy little stream. You come on Ermelo with
surprise, dipping over the brow of a barren ridge and
seeing a cheerful little town beneath you. It suffered
heavily in the war, being literally levelled with the
ground, but when we passed most of the houses had
been cobbled together and new buildings were arising.
It lies in a rich mineral tract, and is also the centre
of a wide pastoral district, so with improved communications
it may very well become a thriving
country town. Whoever laid it out showed good
judgment in the planting of trees; and in that bare
land it is pleasant to come on such a village in a
wood. My chief recollection of Ermelo is of a talk
with a deputation of neighbouring farmers on the
subject of cattle diseases. One admirable old man
explained his perplexity. &ldquo;Formerly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we
used to be told that all diseases came from on High.
Now we are told that some are from on High and
some are our own fault. But which is which? Personally,&rdquo;
he concluded, &ldquo;I believe that Providence
is a good deal to blame for them all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About noon the following day we set out for Amsterdam.
The first part of the road is monotonous,
for it follows a straight line of blockhouses in a bleak
featureless country. We crossed the inevitable Vaal
again, a little larger and perhaps a little dirtier, but
not appreciably more attractive. Sometimes we came
to a flat moor like Rannoch with faint blue mountains
beyond it, but the common type was a succession of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
ridges without a shade of difference between them.
The weather had broken, and dust-coloured showers
pursued us over the face of the heavens, till, as we
came in sight of the considerable hill of Bankkop, the
whole sky behind us had darkened for a wet evening.
As we came down from the height, where the colour
of the roads told of coal, and entered a green marshy
valley, the storm burst on us,&mdash;a true African rain
which drenches a man in two minutes. We sought
shelter in a farmhouse, or rather in a blockhouse in
the stackyard, for there was little left of the house
except a shanty which the owner had restored for his
present accommodation. All evening it rained in
solid sheets, and to dinner, a meal cooked under
difficulties, the Boer farmer came and talked to us,
sitting on a barrel and telling stories of the war.
He had the ordinary tale&mdash;against the war at the
start, compelled to fight, had remonstrated with
Louis Botha on his conduct of the Natal campaign,
and, grumbling greatly, had followed his leader till
he was caught and sent to Ceylon. The Boer discipline
must have been a curious growth, and, when
we realise the intense individualism of the fighting
men, we begin to see the greatness of the achievement
of Botha and Delarey in keeping them together
at all. Our friend was living in squalid penury, but
he was drawing enough in mineral options on his farm
to have restocked it and lived in comfort, if he had
pleased. There is no doubt in my mind, after such
experiences, as to what would have been the wisest
and kindest form of repatriation for landowners, had
we had the courage to adopt it,&mdash;compulsory sale of
a portion of the farm, and out of the capital thus supplied
the farmer could have bought what he wanted
at reasonable prices from Government depots. Such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
a method would have given the Government more
good land, which it urgently wants; it would have
saved the endless credit accounts which in the long-run
will give trouble both to Boer and Government;
and it would have saved the pauperisation into which
the Boer is only too ready to sink. There would, of
course, have been many exceptions in the case of the
very poor and landless classes, but for the landholder
it would have been not only the most politic but in
his eyes the most intelligible plan.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the night spent in that blockhouse.
Every known form of vermin&mdash;fleas, bugs, mosquitoes,
spiders, rats, and, for all I know, snakes&mdash;came
out of the holes where they had fasted for months
and attacked us. I lay for hours swathed in a kaross,
my face tingling, watching through the open square of
door a melancholy moon trying to show herself among
the rain-clouds, and wishing I had had the wisdom to
sleep on the wet veld rather than in that chamber of
horrors. Sheer bodily weariness induced a few uneasy
hours of sleep, but the first ray of dawn found
me thankfully arising. We breakfasted in haste, inspanned
hurriedly, and were on the road an hour after
sunrise. A long ascent brought us to the ridge of
those hills of which Bankkop and Spitzkop are part,
an extension of the Drakensberg from Wakkerstroom
across the veld to the Swazi border. Then we passed
over some very flat meadows to another ridge, from
which we had a clear view of the Slaangaapies mountains
to the south, and before us to the north-east
the long green range of hills above Amsterdam. It
was a curious picture for the Transvaal, a line of hills
with regular glens and soft contours unbroken by rock
or tree, and at the foot in a wood a few white cottages&mdash;a
reminiscence of Galloway or Tweeddale; and one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
can well understand how the Scots settlers, who
founded the place and gave it its first name of
Robburnia after their national poet, saw in the landscape
a picture of their home. We skirted the village
on the left, and found the farm where we were to outspan.
Here heroic measures were taken to get rid of
the results of the blockhouse. A large tub was filled
with hot water, and a bottle of sheep-dip was emptied
into it. In this mixture we wallowed, and emerged
from it scarified but clean.</p>

<p>The farm was the property of a Scots gentleman,
who in six months had made new water-furrows, built
himself a comfortable house, put over 200 acres under
crops, and was running a fair head of stock on the hills.
In the afternoon we rode with him to Mr Forbes&rsquo; farm
of Athole, some three miles off, which is perhaps
the largest private landed estate in one piece in the
country. It runs to some 60,000 acres, a huge square
tract between two streams, from which is obtained a
fine prospect of the Swaziland hills. Mr Forbes, who
owns much land across the border, is one of the two or
three living Englishmen who know the Swazis best,
having for fifty years or more traded, farmed, and
mined in their country. Before the war Athole was a
great game-preserve, with 3000 blesbok, 2000 springbok,
as well as reed-buck, impala, the two rheboks,
and a few klipspringer. Now some odd springbok
along the stream are almost all that remain. But
when Mr Forbes first came to the place eland, koodoo,
and hartebeest were the common game, and one could
kill a lion on most farms. Of the original Scots
settlers, who gave the name of New Scotland to the
district, a few still remain, and their farms can be told
far off by the neat strips of plantation which make
the place like a hillside in Ayrshire. The land was acquired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
very cheaply from the Government,&mdash;one farm,
if tales be true, going for a pair of boots, and another
for a keg of whisky. The Boers themselves bought
the whole tract from the Swazi border to Ermelo, and
from the Komati in the north to the Pongola in the
south&mdash;perhaps 3000 square miles&mdash;from the Swazi
king for 150 oxen and 50 blankets. As at that
time an ox was worth about 30s., it was not a high
price, and the Boers still further improved the bargain
by declining to pay the blankets. When Mr Forbes
came to the place he was visited by a deputation of
Swazi chiefs to discuss the subject, and to save trouble
gave them the blankets from his own stores.</p>

<p>In Amsterdam next morning I was taken for a prospector,
and played the part for a considerable time,
to the confusion of an ex-official of the place, who
wished to profit by my knowledge, but could make
neither head nor tail of my answers. It is a sleepy
little town, with not more than half a dozen houses
lying pleasantly in gardens, with mountain streams on
all sides and pastoral green hills to the east and north.
South, where lay our road, are swelling moorlands,
flanked by the Slaangaapies and the Swazi hills, and
crossed at frequent intervals by clear grey streams.
The first of these is the Compies, a few miles from
the village, and a more naturally perfect trout-stream
I have rarely seen. There were deep blue pools, and
long shallow stretches, and little rapids in whose tail
one should have been able to get a salmon. When
trout become thoroughly acclimatised in the Transvaal,
and the proper waters are stocked, he will be a happy
man who owns a mile or two of the Compies. As if
to intensify the atmosphere of fishing, it began to rain
heavily and a cold mist blew up from the south. The
long grass became hoar with rain-drops, and the innumerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
veld watercourses found their voices after
months of dry silence. Still more lipping grey streams,
and then the rain ceased as suddenly as it had come,
and in a deceptive gleam of sunlight we came into Piet
Retief. It is a long, straggling, dingy village lying
on two ridges. The mountains on all sides are too far
off to be a feature in one&rsquo;s view of it, and save that it
is one of the backdoors to Swaziland, there is little of
interest for the traveller. At the entrance you pass a
monument to Piet Retief, of which only the pedestal
is completed&mdash;a poor tribute to a great man.</p>

<p>After lunch the rain began again in real earnest,
and there was nothing for it but to loiter through the
afternoon in waterproofs and hope for a dry morrow.
It is not the most cheerful of places, but seen through
the pauses of the driving wrack it had a wild charm of
its own. In particular the Slaangaapies mountains, a
dozen miles off, when by any chance they were visible
for a moment, stood out black and threatening, with
white cataracts seaming their sides and murky shadows
in their glens. The Dutch name means &ldquo;Snake-monkeys,&rdquo;
but the natives call them beautifully &ldquo;The
Mother of Rains.&rdquo; The inhabitants of the district are
almost the lowest type in the Transvaal,&mdash;poor, disreputable,
half-bred, despised by their neighbours and
neglected by the late Government. The progressive
element in the district is represented by a German
colony, who were originally placed there by the wily
Boer as a buffer against the natives, but who throve
and multiplied and now own the best farms in the
district. The most interesting thing I saw in the
place was a large Boer hound, with the hair on the
ridge of his back growing in an opposite direction to
the rest of his coat. Now this type is rare, and, when
found, makes the finest hunting dog in the world, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
he will tackle a charging lion, and, indeed, fears
nothing created. I had often been advised if I came
across such a dog to buy him at any price, but in this
case his Dutch owner utterly refused to sell, and I had
to depart in envious gloom.</p>

<p>Before daybreak next morning, in a mist which
clothed the world like a garment, so that we walked in
fleecy vapour, we set off on the sixty miles&rsquo; journey to
Wakkerstroom. The first half is through an exceedingly
dreary land. We crossed the Assegai, a finely
named but inglorious stream, chiefly remarkable for
its rapid flooding, and then for a score of miles we
ascended and descended little sandy hills, and saw on
each side of the road as far as the edge of the mist
the same endless coarse herbage. In fine weather
there is the wall of Slaangaapies to give dignity to the
landscape; but for us there was only a bank of cloud.
Before our mid-day outspan the sky cleared a little,
and huge stony blue hills appeared on our left, with
bush straggling up their sides and stray sun-gleams
on their bald summits. We outspanned for lunch at
Vanderpoel&rsquo;s store, which is a couple of huts in a
perfectly flat dusty plain with a fine ring of hazy
mountains around it. The day became exceedingly
hot, still cloudy, but with a dazzle behind the mists
which it hurt the eye to look at,&mdash;the kind of weather
which makes the cheeks flame and tires the traveller
far more readily than a clear sun and a blue sky.
Again the same hills and dales, but now with a
gradually increasing elevation, till when we came to
a fine stream falling over a precipice into a meadow
and looked back, we saw the Slaangaapies as if from
a neighbour hill-top. A curious little peak appeared
on the right, with what the Dutch call a <i>castrol</i> or
saucepan on its head, a perfectly round ring of kranzes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
which presented the appearance of an extinguisher
dropped down suddenly on the summit. It is a
common sight in this part of the Berg, where the
great original chain of cliffs has been broken and
hills lie tumbled about like the <i>dibris</i> of greater
mountains.</p>

<p>At Joubert&rsquo;s Hoogte the road emerges from the
glens, and the south opens up into a mazy tangle of
hills. It is one of the noblest views in the country;
but for us the mist curtailed the perspective, while it
greatly increased the mystery. Shapes of mountains
floating through a haze have far more fascination for
the lover of highlands than a long prospect to a clearly
defined horizon. Below lay the broad woody valley
of the Upper Pongola, shut off in the east by the spurs
of the Slaangaapies. The far mist was flecked with
little sun-gleams, which showed now an emerald slope,
now the grey and black of a cliff, and now a white
flash of water. The air had the intense stillness of
grey weather and great height; only the neighing of
our horses broke in upon what might have been the
first chaos out of which the world emerged. Thence
for a few miles we kept on the ridge till we dipped
into the hollow of a stream and slowly climbed a long
pass where the road clung to the edges of precipitous
slopes and wriggled among great rocks. The mist
closed down, and but for the feeling in the air which
spoke of wider spaces, we could not have told that we
had reached the top of Castrol&rsquo;s Nek, the gate of the
South-Eastern Transvaal. A Constabulary notice
plastered on a weather-worn board was another sign
that the place was a known landmark. As soon as
we passed the summit the country grew softer. The
shoulders of hills seemed greener, and along the little
watercourses bracken and a richer vegetation appeared.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
The evening was falling, and as we slipped down the
winding road the white mist faded into deeper and
deeper grey, till at last we emerged from it and saw a
clear sky above us and hills standing out black and
rain-washed against the yellows of sunset. By-and-by
in the centre of the amphitheatre of mountains a
dozen lights twinkled out, and in a little we were
off-saddling very weary horses in the pleasant town
of Wakkerstroom.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<h4>THE GREAT NORTH ROAD.</h4>

<p>The romance which is inseparable from all roads
belongs especially to those great arteries of the
world which traverse countries and continents, and
unite different zones and climates, and pass through
extreme variations of humankind. For in them the
adventurous sense of the unknown, which is found
in a country lane among hedgerows, becomes an
ever-present reality to the most casual traveller.
And it is a peculiarity of the world&rsquo;s roads that
this breath of romance blows most strongly on the
paths which point to the Pole-star. The Fmilian
Way, up which the Roman legions clanked to the
battlefields of Gaul and Britain, or that great track
which leads through India to the mountains of the
north and thence to the steppes of Turkestan, captures
the fancy more completely than any lateral
traverse of the globe. A way which passes direct
through the widest extremes of weather, and is in
turn frozen and scorched or blown in sand, has an
air of purpose which is foreign to long tracks in the
same latitude, and carries a more direct impress of
the shaping and audacious spirit of man. Of all
north roads I suppose the greatest to be that which
runs from the Cape to Egypt, greatest both for its
political meaning, the strangeness of the countries to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
which it penetrates, the difficulties and terrors of
the journey, and, above all, for the fact that it is
a traverse of the extreme length of a vast and
mysterious continent. It has been associated in the
south with the schemes of a great dreamer, and in
the north with the practical work of a great soldier
and a great administrator. Between these two
beginnings we all but lose trace of it in wilds of
sand and swamp, the dense forests, the lakes and
the wild mountains of Equatorial Africa, penetrated
at rare intervals by native paths and old hunters&rsquo;
tracks. But to the eye of faith the road is there,
marching on with single purpose from one railway
head on the veld to another in the Soudanese desert.
The men who travel it are hunters and prospectors,
a few soldiers, a chance official, and once and again
an explorer: but they travel only short stages, and
there are few indeed who, like my friend Mr E. S.
Grogan, carry their staff and scrip from end to end
of it. To the amateur, like the present writer, who
goes a little way on it, the thought of this majestic
Way gives dignity to the ill-defined sandy track in
which he may be floundering, and makes each
northern horizon seem like the hill-tops of the Apennines,
somewhere behind which, as the pilgrim is
confident, lie the towers and pinnacles of Rome. I
would recommend as a panacea for cold and comfortless
nights on the road that the mind of the
traveller should occupy itself with a projected itinerary.
He will see the Road running as a hunter&rsquo;s
path from the Limpopo to the Zambesi&mdash;through
thorn scrub and park-land and stony mountain. Then
he will travel up the Shiri by Nyassaland and on
by Tanganyika to Ruwenzori and the lakes; and if
he is not asleep by the time he has seen the sun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
rise on Albert Nyanza and fought his way through the
Dinkas and the mosquitoes of the Nile swamps, then
he must be an unquiet man with an evil conscience.</p>

<p>Only a little section of the road runs through
the Transvaal. The practical road has indeed been
diverted at De Aar in Cape Colony, and in the
shape of a railway runs to Rhodesia and the neighbourhood
of the Victoria Falls. But to the pilgrim
this is a palpable subterfuge, for the straight highway
goes through the Transvaal, taking the form
of a railway as far as Pietersburg, and then becoming
the Bulawayo coach-road for some eighty miles,
till it plunges sheer into the bush as a hunter&rsquo;s
road and makes for Main Drift on the Limpopo.
It is a type of the vicissitudes which the Great
Road is made to suffer,&mdash;railway, admitted highroad,
hunter&rsquo;s path, native track, no road, and then
a chain of waterways till it becomes a river, and
meets the railway again after 3000 miles of obscurity.
With a profound respect for the road, I am constrained
to admit that it makes bad going, that it
is insufficiently provided with water, that there are
no signposts or inns or, for the matter of that, white
habitations, that lions do the survey work and wild
pigs the engineering, and that it is apt to cease
suddenly and leave the traveller to his own devices.
But for the eye of Faith, that wonderful possession
of raw youth and wise old age, it is as broad and
solid as the Appian Way; the wheels of empire and
commerce pass over it, and cities, fairer than a mirage,
seem to rise along its shadowy course.</p>

<p>Our starting-point was the Repatriation depot at
Pietersburg, a large white-walled enclosure, with
row upon row of stables and sheds and in the centre
a cluster of thatched white dwelling-houses. It has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the air of an Eastern caravanserai, for convoys come
in and go out all day long, and the news of the
Road is brought there by every manner of traveller.
Apart from Government work with its endless trains
of ox and mule waggons, it is the starting-place for
all sorts of prospecting and hunting parties, and
farmers from seventy miles round ride in for stock
or supplies. If a lion is killed or gold found or a
man lost anywhere in the north, word will be brought
in to the depot by some Dutch conductor, so that
the place is far better supplied with news of true
interest than your town with its dozen newspapers.
For the essence of news is that it should be vital
to one&rsquo;s daily interests, and tidings of a massacre
in China is less stimulating to the mind than word
of a neighbour&rsquo;s windfall or disaster. I can conceive
no more fascinating life than to dwell comfortably
on the edge of a savage country from which in the
way of one&rsquo;s business all news comes first to one&rsquo;s
ears. To control transport is to be the tutelary genius
of travel, and in a sense the life of the wilds takes
its origin from the little caravanserai which sends
forth and welcomes the traveller.</p>

<p>The high veld continues for some thirty miles north
of the town before it sinks into bush and a humbler
elevation. It is ordinary high veld&mdash;bleak, dusty,
and in August a sombre grey; but on the east the
blue lines, which are the Wood Bush and the Spelonken
mountains, and in the far west the thin hills about the
Magalakween valley, remind the traveller how near
he is to the edge of the central plateau. Ten miles
out a crest was reached, and we looked down on a
long slope, with high mountains making gates in the
distance, and a sharp little hill called Spitzkop set in
the foreground. It was a cool hazy day, and in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
west the kopjes seemed to swim in an illimitable sea
of blue. The land is all part of Malietsie&rsquo;s location,
and patches of tillage and an occasional cluster of
huts gave it a habitable air. The native girls wear
thick rings of brass round their necks, which gives
them a straight figure and a high carriage of the
head, pleasant to see in a place where people slouch
habitually. Malietsie&rsquo;s is one of those Basuto tribes
which are scattered over the North Transvaal&mdash;not the
best type of native, for they are credulous and idle in
their raw state, and when Christianised and dwelling
near mission-stations, incorrigibly lazy and deceitful.
They are also inordinately superstitious. I found that
no one of my boys, who were mostly from Malietsie&rsquo;s,
would stir ten yards beyond the camp after dark. At
first I thought the reason was dread of wild beasts,
but I discovered afterwards that it was fear of spooks,
particularly of one spook who rolled along the road in
the shape of a ball of fire. It is a tribute to the
greatness of the North Road that it should have a
respectable ghost of its own. In a little we passed
the last store, kept by an old Scotsman, who gave us
much information about the district. He talked of
the Road, the River, and the Mountain, without
further designation, which is a pleasing habit of
country folk, who give the generic name to the
instances which dominate their daily life. The Limpopo
was the River, the Zoutpansberg the Mountain,
because no other river or mountain had a local
importance comparable with these, just as to a Highland
gillie his own particular ben is &ldquo;the hill,&rdquo; just
as to Egypt the Nile is not the Nile but &ldquo;the River.&rdquo;
He measured distance, too, by the Road: this place
was so many miles down the road, that water-hole so
many days&rsquo; journey up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
We inspanned again in the evening, and in a little
turned the flanks of Spitzkop, and coming over a
little rise saw a wide plain before us densely covered
with dwarf trees. The long line of the Zoutpansberg
comes to an abrupt end in a cliff above the Zoutpan.
On the west the huge mass of the Blaauwberg also
breaks off sharply in tiers of fine precipices. Between
the two is a level, from fifteen to twenty miles wide,
which is the pass from the high veld to the north.
It is a broad gate, but the only one, for to the east
the Zoutpansberg is impassable for a hundred miles,
and on the west beyond the Blaauwberg the Magalakween
valley is a long circuit and a difficult country.
The great mountain walls were dim with twilight,
but there was day enough left to see the immediate
environs of the road. They had a comical suggestion
of a dilapidated English park. The road was fine
gravel, the trees in the half light looked often like
gnarled oaks and beeches, and the coarse bush grass
seemed like neglected turf. It is a resemblance which
dogs one through the bush veld. You are always
coming to the House and never arriving. At every
turn you expect a lawn, a gleam of water, a grey
wall; soon, surely, the edges will be clipped, the sand
will cease, the dull green will give place to the tender
green of watered grass. But the House remains to
be found, though I have a fancy that it may exist on
a spur of Ruwenzori. As it was, we had to put up
with a tent and a dinner of curried korhaan, and
during the better part of a very cold night some
jackals performed a strenuous serenade.</p>

<p>The next morning dawned clear and very chilly,
the mountains smoking with mist, and the dust
behind our waggons rising to heaven in sharply
outlined columns. However cold and comfortless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the night, however badly the limbs ache from sleeping
on hard ground, there is something in the tonic
mornings which in an hour or so dispels every feeling
but exhilaration. Water-holes have been made for
the post-cart at lengthy intervals, but between there
is nothing but rank bush, with flat trees like the
vegetation in a child&rsquo;s drawing produced by rubbing
the pencil across the paper. Animal life was rich
along the road&mdash;numerous small buck, a belated
jackal or two, the graceful black-and-white birds
which country people call &ldquo;Kaffir queens,&rdquo; korhaan,
guinea-fowl, partridge, quantities of bush crows, and
an endless variety of hawk and falcon. We left the
Road and made a long detour over sandy tracks to
visit the Zoutpan, from which the hills get their
name, the most famous of Transvaal salt-pans. It is
about three miles in circumference, and consisted at
this season of caked grey mud, with little water-trenches
and heaps of white salt on their banks. A
wise law of the late Government forbade the alienation
of salt-pans, but for some unknown reason a
concession was given over this one, and instead of
being the perquisite in winter of the <i>arme Boeren</i> it
is managed by a Pietersburg syndicate, and as far as
I could judge managed very well. The work is done
by natives from the mountains who live round a little
stream which flows from the berg to the pan, and
forms the only fresh water for miles. The day became
very hot, and the glare from the pan was blinding to
unaccustomed eyes. As we returned to the main road,
the noble mass of the Blaauwberg was before us, one
of the finest and least known of South African mountains.
That curious fiasco, the Malapoch war, was
fought there, and Malapoch&rsquo;s people still live in its
corries. To a rock-climber it is a fascinating picture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
with sheer rock walls streaked with fissures which a
glass shows to be chimneys, and I longed to be able
to spend a week exploring its precipices. To a
mountaineer South Africa offers many attractions, for
apart from what may be found in isolated ranges,
there are some hundreds of miles of the Drakensberg
with thousands of good climbs, and above all the
great north-eastern buttress of Mont aux Sources,
which to the best of my knowledge has never been
conquered.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the country changed, the bush
opened out, timber trees took the place of thorn, and
long glades appeared of good winter pasture. There
was a great abundance of game, and for the first time
the paauw appeared, stalking about or slowly flapping
across the grass. He is a fine bird to shoot with the
rifle, but a hard fellow for a gun, for it is difficult to
get within close range; and as a rule at anything over
thirty yards he will carry all the shot you care to give
him. This park-land lasts for about ten miles, and
then at Brak River it ends and a dense thorn scrub
begins, which extends almost without interruption to
the Limpopo. There we found our relays of mules,
and on a dusty patch near the mule-scherm we outspanned
for the night. We were nearing the country
of big game. A lion had been seen on the Bulawayo
road the day before, a little north of the station; and
it was a common enough thing to have them reconnoitring
the scherm. As soon as darkness fell the cry
of wolves began, that curious unearthly wail which is
one of the eeriest of veld sounds. Most forcible reminder
of all, a hunting party ahead of us had lost a
man, who, after wandering for six days in the bush,
while his companions gave him up for dead, had come
out on the Road and been found by the man in charge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of our relays. It was a miracle that he had not lost
his reason or perished of thirst and fatigue, for he had
neither food nor water with him, and only a little cloth
cap to keep off the tropical sun. An old Boer from
Louis Trichard, trekking with oxen, camped beside us;
and after dining delicately off guinea-fowl I went over
to his fire to talk to him. He was a typical back-veld
Boer&mdash;a great hunter, friendly, without any sort of
dignity, a true frontier man, to whom politics mean
nothing and his next meal everything. He told me
amazing lion stories, in which he always gave the
<i>coup de grbce</i>, and displayed incredible courage and
skill. He showed me with pride a 7400 express bullet
which he kept wrapt up in paper&mdash;whether as a charm
or a souvenir I do not know, for his own weapon was an
ancient Martini. His one political prejudice concerned
the Jews, whose character he outlined to me with
great spirit. They were the opposite of everything
implied in the term &ldquo;oprecht&rdquo;; but I am inclined to
believe that, like many of us, he secretly believed that
all foreigners were Jews, and in hugging the prejudice
showed himself a nationalist at heart.</p>

<p>The coach-road runs due north to Tuli and Bulawayo,
but the Road itself takes a slight bend to the east and
follows the course of the mythical Brak River. For
miles this stream does not exist&mdash;there is not even the
slightest suggestion of a bed; and then appears a
dirty hole full of greenish, brackish water, and we hail
the resurrected river. It is necessary for the traveller
to know where such holes lie, for they are the only
water in the neighbourhood; and though the Road
keeps close to them, there is nothing in the dense
thorn bush which lines its sides to reveal the presence
of water. I have never seen bleaker bush-land. All
day long, through hanging clouds of dust, we crept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
through the featureless country, the Zoutpansberg and
Blaauwberg behind us growing hourly fainter. For
the information of travellers, I would say that the
first water is at a place called Krokodilgat, the second
at a place called Rietgaten, and that after that the
Road bends northward away from the river, and there
is no water till Taqui is reached. The dust of the
track was thick with the spoor of wild cats, wolves,
the blue wildebeest, and at rare intervals of wild
ostrich. As night fell the bush became very dead and
silent, save for the far-away howl of a jackal,&mdash;a dull
olive-green ocean under a wonderful turquoise sky.
We encamped after dark in a little wayside hollow,
where we built a large fire and a massive scherm or
enclosure of thorns for the animals. There was every
chance of a lion, so I retired to rest with pleasant
anticipations and a quantity of loaded firearms near
my head. But no lion came, though about two o&rsquo;clock
in the morning the mules grew very restless, and
a majestic figure (which was indeed no other than the
present writer&rsquo;s), armed with a 7400 express, might
have been seen clambering about the top of the
waggon and straining sleepy eyes into the bush.</p>

<p>We started at dawn next morning, as we had a long
journey before water. The thorn bush disappeared
and gave place to a more open country, full of a kind
of wormwood which gave an aromatic flavour to the
fresh morning air. Then came a new kind of bush,
the mopani, a wholesome green little shrub, with
butterfly-shaped foliage. The leaves of this tree
would appear to be for the healing of the nations, for a
decoction of them is regarded both as a preventive
against and a cure for malaria; and a mopani poultice
is a sovereign cure for bruises. Among the spoor on
the track was that of a large lion going towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Taqui. There were also to our surprise the spoor and
droppings of oxen. When about eleven o&rsquo;clock we
reached the large pits of whitey-blue brackish water
which bear that name, we found the reason of both.
A shooting party encamped there had had their cattle
stampeded in the night, and early in the morning
a Dutch hunter who accompanied them had gone out
to look for them, and found an ox freshly killed by a
lion not a quarter of a mile from the camp. He
followed the lion, and wounded him with a long-range
shot. When we arrived the search for the lion had
begun, and he was found stone-dead a little way on,
with his belly distended with ox-flesh and the bullet
in his lungs. He was a very large lion, measuring
about ten and a-half feet from tip to tip, rather old,
and with broken porcupine-quills embedded in his
skin. A trap-gun was set, and two nights later a
very fine young black-maned lion, about the same
size, was found dead a hundred yards from the trap,
with a broken shoulder and a bullet in his spine. The
remainder of the story shows the Providence which
watches over foolish oxen. All were recovered save
one, which died of red-water. They went straight
back the road they had come; and though the
country-side was infested with lions, wolves, and
tiger-cats, they reached the mule-scherm at Brak
River in safety.</p>

<p>From Taqui the road climbs a chain of kopjes where
it is almost overarched with trees, so that a covered
waggon has difficulty in getting through. From the
summit there is a long prospect of flat bush country
running to the Limpopo, with a bold ridge of hills on
the Rhodesian side, and far to the east the faint line of
mountains which is the continuation of the Zoutpansberg
to the Portuguese border. The bush was dotted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
with huge baobabs, the cream-of-tartar trees which so
impressed the voortrekkers in Lydenburg. At this
season the branches were leafless, but a good deal of
fruit remained, which our native boys eagerly gathered
and munched for the rest of the journey. The fruit
has a hard shell, and is filled with little white kernels
like the sweetmeat called Turkish Delight. They
have a faint sub-acid flavour, but otherwise are rather
insipid. Their properties are highly salutary, and
they are used to purify bad water and to keep the
hunters&rsquo; blood clean in the absence of vegetable food.
Their enormous trunks, often forty feet in circumference,
are not wood but a sort of fibrous substance,
so that a solid rifle bullet fired from short range will
go through them. The baobab is indeed less a tree
than a gigantic and salutary fungus; but in a distant
prospect of landscape it has the scenic effect of large
timber. An old Boer in the hunting party we had
passed had given us an estimate of the distance to the
next water; but, as it turned out, he was hopelessly
wrong. It is nearly impossible to get a proper
calculation of distance from country-people in South
Africa. They are accustomed to calculate in hours,
which of course vary in every district according to
the nature of the road and the quality of the transport.
Six miles an hour is the usual allowance; but
when a Dutchman tries to calculate in miles he gets
wildly out of his bearings. The hours method still
sticks in their mind; and one man solemnly informed
us that a certain place was six miles off for horses and
ten for mules.</p>

<p>We outspanned for the night without water, and
with the accompaniment of scherm and camp fires.
Next morning we came suddenly out of the bush to a
perfect English dell, where a little clear stream, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
first running water we had seen, flowed out of a reed-bed
into a rock pool. There were a few large trees
and quantities of a kind of small palm. Under the
doubtful shade of a baobab we breakfasted, and then
went up the stream with our rifles to look for game.
There was the usual superfluity of birds, but we saw
no big game except a few bush-hogs. The stream
ceased as suddenly as it began, and we followed up a
dry sandy bed all but overgrown with a thorn thicket.
A mile or so up we came on another pool, which was
evidently the drinking-place of the bush, for the edges
were trodden with the spoor of pig and monkey and a
few large buck. Pig drink during the day, but the
large game come to the water early in the morning or
very late in the evening, and in the heat of mid-day
go many miles into the bush. It was a hot business
ploughing along in the deep sand, and I was very glad
to return to the rock-pool and a bath on a cool slab
of stone. It is a good bush-veld rule to follow the
advice of Mr Jorrocks and sleep where you eat, and
in the shade of the waggon we dozed till the cooler
afternoon. The evening trek was in the old thorn-country,
perfectly featureless, silent, and uninhabited.
Since Malietsie&rsquo;s location we had seen no Kaffirs except
our own and the post-runners, and we were told
that this whole tract of land is almost without natives.
Even the water-holes, some of which are large and
permanent, have failed to attract inhabitants. I am
reminded of a story which has no application, but is
worth recording. It was told to a burgher camp
official by an old and deeply religious Boer, who was
greatly pained at the experience. He fell asleep, he
said, one night and dreamed; and, lo and behold, he
was dead and at the gates of Paradise. An affable
angel met him and conducted him to a place where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
people were playing games and laughing loudly, and
were generally consumed with energy and high spirits.
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said his guide, &ldquo;is the Rooinek heaven.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No place for me,&rdquo; said the dreamer; &ldquo;these folk do
not keep the Sabbath, and their noise wearies me.&rdquo;
Then he came to another place where there was much
beer and tobacco, and roysterers were swilling from
long mugs and smoking deep-bowled pipes to the
strains of a brass band. &ldquo;Again this intolerable
row,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;though the tobacco looks
good&mdash;clearly the German paradise.&rdquo; The next place
they came to was a town where thin-faced men were
running about buying and selling and screeching
market quotations. My friend would not at first
believe that this was Paradise at all, but his informant
said it was the corner reserved for virtuous
Americans. &ldquo;Take me as soon as possible to the
paradise of my own folk,&rdquo; said the dreamer; &ldquo;I am
tired of these uitlander heavens.&rdquo; And then it seemed
to him he was taken to a very beautiful country place,
with rich green veld, seamed with water-furrows, and
huge orchards of peaches and nartjes, and pleasant
little houses with broad stoeps. The soul of my friend
was ravished at the sight. Clearly, he thought, the
Boers are God&rsquo;s chosen folk, and he was about to
select his farm when a thought struck him. &ldquo;But
where are all our people?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said
the affable angel, dropping a tear, &ldquo;it pains me to
tell you that they are all in the Other Place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our evening outspan was below the kopjes where
the copper mines lie, and a few tracks in the veld and
an empty tin or two gave warning of human habitation.
These copper mines, which are about to be
thoroughly exploited by Johannesburg companies, are
old Kaffir workings, and, possibly, from some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
remains, Ph&oelig;nician. The scenery suddenly became
very peculiar,&mdash;English park-land, but with a tint of
green which I have never seen before, a kind of dull
metallic shade like some mineral dye. There were
avenues of tolerably high trees, and a sort of natural
hedgerow. The grass was short and rich, and but for
the odd hue not unlike a home meadow. There were
also a number of wood-pigeons of the same metallic
green, so that the whole place was a symphony in a
not very pleasing colour. Early next morning, leaving
our transport behind, we set off for the Limpopo, which
is about eight miles off. The thorn thickets appeared
again, and the heat as we descended into the valley
became oppressive. The altitude of the river is about
1500 feet, which is a descent of nearly 3000 feet from
the high veld, and even in winter time the heat is
considerable, for the soil is a fine sand, and no breeze
penetrates to the wooded valley. I had seen the Limpopo
a wild torrent in the passes of the Magaliesberg,
and I had seen it a broad navigable river at its mouth;
so I was scarcely prepared for the bed of dazzling
white sand which here represented the stream. Main
Drift is about a quarter of a mile wide, with a bed of
bulrushes in the centre, and except for a thin trickle
close to the Rhodesian shore it is as dry as the Egyptian
desert. But twelve miles higher up it is a full stream
with rapids and falls, crocodile and hippo, and some
miles down it is a stagnant tropical lagoon. The water
is there, but buried below Heaven knows how many feet
of rock and sand. Those mysterious African rivers
which disappear and return after many miles have a
fascination for the mind which cares for the inexplicable.
The valley is there, the bulrushes, the shingle,
the water-birds, but no river&mdash;only a ribbon of white
sand, or a few dusty holes in the rock. And then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
without warning, as the traveller stumbles down the
valley, water rises before him like a mirage, and instead
of a desert he has a river-side. There is little
kinship between the torrent which rushes through
Crocodile Poort and this arid hollow, but the great
river never loses itself, and though it is foiled and
swamped and strained through sand it succeeds in
the end, like Oxus in the poem, in collecting all its
waters, and pours a stately flood through the low
coast-lands to the ocean. Ploughing about in the dry
bed under the tropical noontide sun was dreary work,
and put us very much in the position of Mr Pliable in
the Slough of Despond, when he cried, &ldquo;May I get out
again with my life, you shall possess the brave country
alone for me.&rdquo; We saw a number of spur-winged
geese, which for some reason the Boers call wild
Muscovy, and a heron or two sailing down the blue.
A little up stream there was a lagoon in the sand
flanked on one side by rocks&mdash;a clear deep pool, where
a man might bathe without fear of strange beasts.
Wallowing in the lukewarm water, the glare exceeded
anything I have known&mdash;blue water, white rock, and
acres and acres of white sand between hot copper-coloured
hills.</p>

<p>As we left the river we said farewell to the Road.
It showed itself on the Rhodesian side climbing a
knoll past a cluster of huts which had once been a
police station, but had been relinquished because of the
great mortality from fever. Thereafter it was lost
among bush and a chain of broken hills. It cared
nothing for appearances, being sandy and overgrown
and in places scarcely a track at all, for it had a weary
way to go before it could be called a civilised road
again. There was something purposeful and gallant
in the little trail plunging into the wilds, and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
regret we took our last look of it and turned our faces
southwards.</p>

<p>Our way back lay mostly through dense bush-land,
and in the days of hunting and the evenings round the
fire I saw much of the life and realised something of
the fascination of this strange form of country. It has
no obvious picturesqueness, this interminable desert of
thorn and sand and rank grass, varied at rare intervals
by a raw kopje or a clump of timber. The sun beats
on it at mid-day with pitiless force, and if it was hot
in the month of August, what must it be at midsummer?
The rivers are sand-filled ditches, and the
infrequent water is found commonly in brack lagoons;
but, dry as it is, it has none of the wholesomeness of
most arid countries, generally forming a hotbed of
fever. An aneroid which I carried to give a flavour
of science to our expedition, put its average elevation
at between 1500 and 2000 feet. Agriculture
is everywhere impossible, though some of the better
timbered parts might make good winter ranching
country. But, apart from possible mineral exploitation,
the land must remain hunting veld, and indeed
is favourably placed for a large-game preserve. The
very scarcity of water makes it a suitable dwelling-place
for the larger buck, who drink but once a-day;
and the difficulty of penetrating such a desert will be
an effective agent in preservation. A man walking
through it sees nothing for days beyond the dead
green of thorn bush, till he comes to some slight ridge
and overlooks a round horizon, a plain flat as mid-ocean,
crisped with the same monotonous dwarf trees.
Hidden away round water-holes there are glades and
drives with a faint hint of that softness which to us is
inseparable from woodland scenery, but they are so few
that they only increase by contrast the sense of hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
desolation. The bush is very silent. Its dwellers make
no noise as they move about, till evening brings the cries
of beasts of prey. The nights in winter are intensely
cold, with a sharpness which I found more difficult to
endure than the honest frost of the high veld. The
noons are dusty and torrid, and the thirst of the bush
is a thing not easily coped with. But in three phases
this desert took on a curious charm. That South
African landscape must be bleak indeed which is not
transformed by the mornings and evenings. For two
hours after sunrise a chill hangs in the air, light fresh
winds blow from nowhere, and the scrub which is so
dead and ugly at mid-day assumes clear colours and
stands out olive-green and rich umber against the pale
sky. At twilight the wonderful amethyst haze turns
everything to fairyland, the track shimmers among
purple shadows, and every little gap in the bush is
magnified to a glade in a forest. I have also a very
vivid memory of a view from one of the small ridges
in full moonlight. It was like looking from a hill-top
on a vast virgin forest, a dark symmetrical ocean of
tree-tops with a glimpse of ivory from an open space
where the road emerged for a moment from the
covert.</p>

<p>There is little danger in hunting here unless you
are happy enough to meet a lion and so unfortunate
as not to kill with the first shot. But it is very
arduous and hot, the clothes become pincushions of
thorns, face and hands are scratched violently with
swinging boughs, and a man&rsquo;s temper is apt to get
brittle at times. In thick bush one can only hunt by
spoor, and it is a slow business with a grilling sun on
one&rsquo;s back and a few obtuse native boys. The native
is usually a good tracker, but he is an unsatisfactory
colleague because of the difficulty of communicating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
with him. For one thing, even in a language which
he understands, he does not seem to know the meaning
of the note of interrogation. If he is asked if a certain
mark is a black wildebeest&rsquo;s spoor, he imagines that
his master asserts that such is the case, and politely
hastens to agree with him, whereas he knows perfectly
well that it is not, and if he understood that
he was being asked for information, would give it
willingly. The difficulty, too, of hunting by a kind
of rude instinct is that when this instinct is at fault
he is left utterly helpless, and has no notion of any
sort of deductive reasoning. If a native is once lost
he is thoroughly lost, though his knowledge of the
country may enable him to keep alive when a white
man would die. I found also that my boys had so
many errands of their own to do in the bush that
it was difficult to keep them to their work. They
scrambled for baobab fruit; they hunted for wolves&rsquo;
and lions&rsquo; dung, from which they make an ointment,
smeared with which they imagine they can safely
walk through the bush at all seasons. The supreme
danger of this kind of life is undoubtedly to be lost
away from water and tracks. It is a misfortune
which any man may suffer, but for any one with
some experience of savage country, who takes his
bearings carefully at the start and never gets out
of touch with them, the danger is very small. In
this country there is always some landmark&mdash;a kopje,
a big tree, and in some parts the distant ranges of
mountains&mdash;by which, with the sun and some knowledge
of the lie of the land, one can safely travel
many miles from the camp. For a man on a good
horse there is no excuse, here at any rate, for losing
himself; for a man on foot heat and fatigue and the
closeness of the bush may well drive all calculations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
out of his head. Apart from other terrors, a night in
those wilds is likely to be disturbed from the attentions
of beasts of prey, and a man who has not the
means of making a scherm or a fire will have to spend
a restless night in a tree. To be finally and hopelessly
lost is the most awful fate which I can imagine.
It is easy to conjure up the details, and many uneasy
nights I have spent in such dismal forecasts. First,
the annoyance, the hasty pushing through the scrub,
believing the camp to be just in front, and lamenting
that you are late for dinner. Then the slow fatigue,
the slow consciousness that the camp is not there, that
you do not know where you are, and that you must
make the best of the night in the open. Morning
comes, and confidently you try to take your bearings;
by this time others are seeking you, you reflect, and
with a little care you can find your whereabouts and
go to meet them. Then a long hot day, without
water or food, pushing eternally through the dull
green scrub, every moment leaving confidence a little
weaker, till the second night comes, and you doze
uneasily in a horror of nightmare and physical illness.
Then the spectral awaking, the watching of a giddy
sunrise, the slow forcing of the body to the same hopeless
quest, till the thorns begin to dance before you
and the black froth comes to the lips, and in a little
reason takes wing, and you die crazily by inches in
the parched silence.</p>

<p>I have said that the bush is without human inhabitants,
but every now and then we found traces
of other travellers. A dusty pack-donkey would
suddenly emerge from the thicket, followed by two
dusty and sunburnt men, each with some prehistoric
kind of gun. Sometimes we breakfasted with this
kind of party, and heard from them the curious tale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of their wanderings. They would ask us the news,
having seen no white man for half a-year, and it was
odd to see the voracity with which they devoured the
very belated papers we could offer them. They had
been east to the Portuguese border and west to
Bechuanaland and north to the Zambesi, pursuing
one of the hardest and most thankless tasks on
earth. The prospector skirmishes ahead of civilisation.
On his labours great industries are based, but
he himself gets, as a rule, little reward. Fever and
starvation are incidents of his daily life, and yet
there is a certain relish in it for the old stager, and I
doubt if he would be content to try an easier job
which curtailed his freedom. For, if you think of
it, there is an undercurrent of perpetual excitement
in the life, which is treasure-hunting made a business:
any morning may reveal the great reef or the rich
pipe, and change this dusty fellow with his tired mules
into a nabob. Among the taciturn men who crept
out of the bush every type was represented, from
Australian cow-punchers to well-born gentlemen from
home, whose names were still on the lists of good
clubs. One party I especially remember, three huge
Canadians, who came in the darkness and encamped
by our fire. They had a ramshackle cart and two
mules, and the whole outfit was valeted by the very
smallest nigger-boy you can imagine. It did one good
to see the way in which that child sprang to attention
at sunrise, and, clad simply in a gigantic pair of khaki
trousers and one side of an old waistcoat, lit the fire,
made coffee for his three masters, cooked breakfast,
caught and harnessed the mules, and was squatting
in the cart, all within the shortest possible time. The
Canadians had been all over the world and in every
profession, but of all trades they liked the late war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
best, and made anxious inquiries about Somaliland.
They were the true adventurer type,&mdash;long, thin,
hollow-eyed, tough as whipcord, men who, like the
Black Douglas, would rather hear the lark sing than
the mouse cheep. After making fierce inroads on my
tobacco, and giving me their views on the native question
and many incidental matters, they departed into
the Western bush, one man cracking the whip and
whistling &ldquo;Annie Laurie,&rdquo; and the other two, with
guns, creeping along on the flanks. I took off my
hat in spirit to the advance-guard of our people, the
men who know much and fear little, who are always
a little ahead of everybody else in the waste places of
the earth. You can readily whistle them back to the
defence of some portion of the Empire or gather them
for the maintenance of some single frontier; but when
the work is done they retire again to their own places,
with their eyes steadfastly to the wilds but their ears
always open for the whistle to call them back once
more.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<h4>THE FUTURE OF SOUTH AFRICAN SPORT.</h4>

<p>The great days of South African sport are over,
and there is no disguising the fact. Open any early
record, such as Oswell or Gordon-Cumming, and the
size and variety of the bag dazzles the mind of the
amateur of to-day. Then it was possible to shoot
lion in Cape Colony and elephant in the Transvaal,
and to find at one&rsquo;s door game whose only habitat is
now some narrow region near the Mountains of the
Moon. Turn even to the later pages of Mr Selous,
and anywhere north of a line drawn east and west
through Pretoria, there was such sport to be had as
can now be found with difficulty on the Zambesi. The
absence of game laws and the presence of many bold
hunters have cleared the veld of the vast herds of
antelope which provided the voortrekker with fresh
meat, and the advance of industry and settlement
have driven predatory animals still farther afield.
From the Zambesi southward ten or twelve species
of antelope may still be found in fair numbers, but
the nobler and larger kinds of game, the giraffe, the
koodoo, the black wildebeest, the two hartebeests, and
the eland, are scarce save in a few remote valleys.
The white rhinoceros is almost extinct and the ordinary
kind uncommon. The hippopotamus, which is not
a sporting animal, is still found in most tropical rivers;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
wild pigs&mdash;both bush-hog and wart-hog&mdash;are plentiful
in the northern bush; but the graceful zebra is rapidly
disappearing. Lion are still fairly easy to come on
unawares anywhere north of the Limpopo, and in the
mountains and flats of the north-eastern Transvaal.
A few troops of elephant may exist unpreserved in the
region between the Pungwe and the Zambesi, a few
in Northern Mashonaland, with perhaps one or two in
the Northern Kalahari. The war, on the whole, has
been on the side of the wild animals, for though large
herds of springbok and blesbok were slaughtered by
the troops on the high veld, the native, that inveterate
poacher, has been restrained from his evil ways
by lucrative military employment, so that the northern
districts are better stocked to-day than they were
five years ago. But the fact remains that South
Africa is no longer virgin hunting-veld. The game
is disappearing, and, unless every care is taken, will
in a few years go the way of the American buffalo.
If we are to preserve for South Africa its oldest inhabitants,
and keep it as a hunting-ground for the true
sportsman, we must bestir ourselves and act promptly.
In this, as in graver questions, an intelligent forethought
must take the place of the old slackness.</p>

<p>Such a policy must take two forms,&mdash;the establishment
of good laws for the preservation of game and
the regulation of sport, and the formation of game-reserves.
The best course would have been to declare
a rigid close time for five years, during which
no game other than birds and destructive animals
should be killed, save in the case of damage to crops.
The administrative difficulties, however, in the way
of such a heroic remedy were very great, and the code
of game laws, now in force in the Transvaal, seems to
mark the limit of possible restriction. Under these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
power is given to declare a close season&mdash;a valuable
discretionary power, since the season varies widely
for different kinds of game&mdash;during which no game
may be killed, and also to preserve absolutely any
specified bird or animal in any specified district up to
a period of three years. This would permit the absolute
preservation of such animals as the springbok
and the blesbok in certain parts of the country where
they are scarce, without interfering with sport in
other localities where they are plentiful. The ordinary
shooting licence for birds and antelope is fixed at
#3 for the season; but certain rarer animals have
been made special game, and to hunt these permission
must be obtained in writing from the Colonial Secretary
and a fee paid of #25. The chief of these are
the elephant, hippo, rhinoceros, buffalo; the quagga
and the zebra; the two hartebeests, the two wildebeests,
the roan and the sable antelope, the koodoo,
eland, giraffe, and tsessabe. The wild ostrich and
that beautiful bird the mahem or crested crane
(<i>Chrysopelargus balearica</i>) are also included. Provision
is made against the sale or destruction of the
eggs of game-birds and the sale of dead game in the
close season. Under this law the ordinary man, on the
payment of a small sum, has during the season the
right to shoot over thirty varieties of game-birds and
over a dozen kinds of buck, as well as wild pig and lion
and tiger-cats, if he is fortunate enough to find them,
on most Crown lands and on private lands when he
can get the owner&rsquo;s permission,&mdash;a tolerably wide field
for the sportsman. But restrictive laws are not enough
in themselves; it is necessary to provide an equivalent
to the sanctuary in a deer-forest, reserves where
wild animals are immune at all seasons. The late
Government established several nominal reserves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
notably on the Lesser Sabi River and in the extreme
eastern corner of Piet Retief which adjoins Tongaland;
but no proper steps were taken to enforce the reservations.
The new Government has strictly delimited
the Sabi preserve and appointed a ranger; and certain
adjoining land companies between the Sabi and the
Olifants have made similar provisions for their own
land. But one reserve in one locality is not enough.
The true principle is to establish a small reserve and
a sanctuary in each district. Part of the Crown lands
in Northern Rustenburg, in Waterberg, in Northern
and Eastern Zoutpansberg, and especially in the
Springbok Flats district, might well be formed into
reserves without any real injury to such agricultural
and pastoral development as they are capable
of. If the greater land companies could be induced
to follow suit&mdash;and there is no reason why they
should not&mdash;an effective and far-reaching system of
game preservation could be put in force.<a name="FNanchor_12_12"
id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Finally,
something must be done at once to stop native poaching,
more especially the depredations of the wretched
Kaffir dogs. Officers of constabulary, land inspectors,
as well as all owners and lessees of farms, should have
the power to shoot at sight any dog trespassing on
a game-preserve or detected in the pursuit of game.
An increased dog-tax, too, might stop the present
system of large mongrel packs which are to be seen
in any Kaffir kraal. A stringent Vermin Act, which
is highly necessary for the protection of small stock
like sheep and goats, would also help to prevent the
slaughter of buck by wild dogs and jackals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
But for the big-game hunter, in the old African
sense, there is little or nothing left. The day of
small things has arisen, and we must be content to
record tamely our sport in braces of birds and heads
of small buck, where our grandfathers recorded theirs
in lion-skins and tusks and broken limbs. Big game
there still is, but they are far afield, and have to be
pursued at some risk to horse and man from fly
and malaria. The lion, as I have said, is still fairly
common in the district between Magatoland and the
Limpopo, in the continuation of the Zoutpansberg
east to the Rooi Rand, down the slopes of the
Lebombo, and in the flats along the Lower Letaba,
Olifants, and Limpopo. He is frequently met with
in most parts of Rhodesia, though his habits are
highly capricious, and while a tourist one day&rsquo;s
journey from Salisbury may see several, a man who
spends six months hunting may never get a shot.
Portuguese territory is still a haunt of big game,
though the natives are doing their best to exterminate
it, for the thick bush and the pestilent
climate between the Lebombo and the sea will
always make hunting difficult; and the Pungwe
and its tributaries still form, at the proper season,
perhaps the best shooting-ground south of the Zambesi.
The elephant cannot be counted a quarry; and
any man who attempts to kill an elephant in South
Africa to-day deserves severe treatment, save in such
preserves as the Addo Bush and the Knysna forest
in Cape Colony, where they are rapidly becoming
a nuisance. A few head of buffalo still survive, in
spite of rinderpest, in the extreme Eastern Transvaal,
as well as in Portuguese territory; and the
eland, that noblest and largest of buck, is found
along the Portuguese border. Report has it that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
in some of the Drakensberg kloofs between Basutoland
and Natal a few stray eland may also be found.
The beautiful antelopes, sable and roan, the exquisite
koodoo, the blue wildebeest and the two hartebeests,
roam in small herds on the malarial eastern flats,
and a few giraffe are reported from the same
neighbourhood. The gemsbok, with his lengthy taper
horns, has long been confined to the remote parts
of the Kalahari.</p>

<p>A big-game expedition will, therefore, in a few
years&rsquo; time still be a possibility in Central South
Africa, and with judicious management it may long
remain so, for those who can afford the time and
the not inconsiderable expense. The best place must
remain the country between the Lebombo and the
Drakensberg, and north from the Olifants to the
Limpopo. Eastern Mashonaland, the Kalahari, and
the Pungwe district will be available for those who
care to go farther afield. The venue must be chosen
according as a man proposes to hunt on horse or
on foot. Both forms of sport have their attractions.
On the great open flats of the Kalahari and Rhodesia
no sport in the world can equal the pursuit of big
game with a trained horse&mdash;the wild gallop, stalking,
so to speak, at racing speed, the quick dismounting
and firing, the pursuit of a maimed animal, the
imminent danger, perhaps, from a charging buffalo
or a wounded lion. This horseback hunting is, as
a rule, pursued in a healthy country, every moment
is full of breathless excitement, and success requires
a steady nerve and a sure seat. But stalking on
foot in thick bush makes greater demands on bodily
strength and self-possession. The country is rarely
wholesome, and in those blazing flats a long daylight
stalk will tire the strongest. There is more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
need, too, for veld-craft, and an intimate knowledge
of the habits of game; and when game is found,
there is more need for a clear eye and a steady
pulse, for a man hunting in veldschoen and a shirt
is pretty well at the mercy of a mad animal. But
in both forms of sport there is the same lonely freedom,
the same wonderful earth, and the same homely
and intimate comforts. No man can ever forget the
return, utterly tired, in the cool dusk, which is alive
with the glimmer of wings, and the sight of the
waggon-lantern and the great fire at which the boys
are cooking dinner. A wash and a drink&mdash;indispensable
after a hot day lest a man should overstay his
appetite; and then a hunter&rsquo;s meal, which tastes as
the cookery of civilisation seldom tastes. There is
no reason why a hunter should not live well, far
better than in any South African town, for he can
count on fresh meat always, and, if he is fortunate,
on eggs and fish and fruit. And then the evening
pipe in a deck-chair, with the big lantern swinging
from a tree, the great fire making weird shadows
in the forest, and natives chattering drowsily around
the ashes. Lastly, to an early bed in his blankets,
and up again at dawn, with another day before him
of this sane and wholesome life.</p>

<p>The chief dangers in African hunting, greater far
than any from wild animals, are the chances of malaria
and the possibility of getting lost. In many trips
the first may be absent, but for a keen man it is
often necessary to time his expeditions when the
grass is short or when he has a chance of having
the field to himself, periods which do not always
coincide with the healthy season. It is not for anyone
to venture lightly on a long hunting trek. But,
granted a sound constitution, decent carefulness in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
matters such as the abstinence from all liquids save
at meals, and from alcohol save before dinner, and
the rigorous use of a mosquito-curtain, can generally
bring a man safely through. The system can be
fortified by small and regular doses of quinine, and
the camp should be pitched, whenever possible, in
some dry and open spot. These may seem foolish
precautions to an old hunter whose body has been
seasoned with innumerable attacks, but it is wise
for one who has not suffered that misfortune to take
every means to avoid it. To be lost in the bush is
an accident which every man is horribly afraid of,
and which may happen any day even to the most
cautious, unless he has gone far in the curious lore
of the wilds. There are men, of course, who are
beyond the fear of it, chosen spirits to whom a
featureless plain is full of intricate landmarks, and
the sky is a clearer chart than any map. But the
common traveller may walk a score of yards or so
from the path, look round, see all about him high
waving grasses somewhere in which the road is
hidden, go off hastily in what seems the right direction,
walk for a couple of hours and change his mind,
and then, lo! and behold, his nerve goes and he is
lost, perhaps for days, perhaps for ever. The ordinary
procedure of a hunting trip, tossing for beats in the
morning and then scattering each in a different direction,
gives scope for such misfortunes. The safest
plan is, of course, never to go out without a competent
native guide; and, where this precaution is
out of the question, the next best is to rely absolutely
on some experienced member of the party who can
follow spoor, sit down once you have lost your bearings,
and wait till he finds you. A time is fixed
after which, if a man does not return, it is presumed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
that he is in difficulties, and a search party is sent
out; and naturally it saves a great deal of trouble
if a man does not confuse the searchers by constantly
going back on his tracks. If the hunter is on horseback
he can try trusting his horse, which is said&mdash;I
have happily never had occasion to prove the truth
of the saying&mdash;to be able on the second day to go
back to its last water. The whole hunting veld is
full of gruesome tales of men utterly lost or found
too late; and most hunting parties in flat or thickly
wooded country come back with a wholesome dread
of the mischances of the bush.</p>

<p>For the man who has little time to spare there
remain the smaller buck. And such game is not to
be lightly despised. The commonest and smallest are
the little duiker and steinbok, shy, fleet little creatures
which give many a sporting shot and make excellent
eating. I suppose there are few farms in any part of
South Africa without a few of them, and in some
districts they are nearly as common as hares on
an English estate. The springbok, a true gazelle, is
more local in his occurrence, though large herds still
exist in Cape Colony and parts of the Orange River
Colony. Fair-sized herds are to be found, too, in the
western district of the Transvaal and in certain parts
of Waterberg and Ermelo. The blesbok is rather less
frequent, though he used to be common enough, but
there are numerous small herds in various parts of
the country. These four varieties are the stand-by of
South African shooting: other buck are to be sought
more as trophies than in the ordinary way of sport.
The water-buck, with his handsome head, and extremely
poor venison, is common along all the sub-tropical
and tropical rivers, but to shoot him requires
a certain amount of trekking. So with the reed-buck,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
who haunts the same localities, though he is still
found in places so close to the high veld as the
southern parts of Marico and the Amsterdam district
in the east. The beautiful impala, with his reddish
coat and delicately notched antlers, is the commonest
buck in the Sabi game-preserves, and extends over
most of the bush veld, as well as parts of Waterberg
and a few farms in the south-east. The klipspringer
is found on all the slopes of the great eastern range
of mountains, and is very common on the Natal side
of the Drakensberg. He is a beautiful and difficult
quarry, having a chamois-like love of inaccessible
places, and being able to cover the most appalling
ground at racing speed. The vaal rhebok and the
rooi rhebok are found in small numbers in the same
localities, and the latter is also fairly common in the
wooded hills around Zeerust. Both the bush-pig and
the wart-hog are plentiful in the bush veld, and on
the slopes of the eastern mountains. Finally, the
bush-buck, one of the most beautiful, and, for his size,
the fiercest of all buck, is widely distributed among
the woods of Cape Colony and Natal, and in the belts
of virgin forest which extend with breaks from Swaziland
to Zoutpansberg. Living in the dense undergrowth,
he has been pretty well out of the way of the
hunter who killed for the pot. He is an awkward
fellow to meet at close quarters in a bad country, for,
when wounded, he will charge, and his powerful horns
are not pleasant to encounter. There have been
several cases of natives, and even of white men, who
have died of wounds from his assaults. His elder
brother, the inyala, does not, so far as I know, appear
south of the Limpopo.</p>

<p>The favourite South African method of shooting
such game as the springbok is by driving him with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
army of native beaters down wind against the guns.
In an open country buck can be stalked on horseback
or ridden down in the Dutch fashion of &ldquo;brandt.&rdquo;
Elsewhere stalking on foot is the only way, a difficult
matter unless the hunter knows the habits and haunts
of the game. South African shooting seems hard at
first to the new-comer, partly from the difficulty of
judging distances in the novel clearness of the air,
partly from the shyness of game, which often makes
it necessary to take shots at a range which seems
ridiculous to one familiar only with Scots deer-stalking,
and partly from the extraordinary tenacity of life
which those wild animals show,<a name="FNanchor_13_13"
id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
limiting the choice
of marks to a very few parts of the body. But experience
can do much, and in time any man with a
clear eye and good nerve may look for reasonable
success. As has been noted in a former chapter, the
best shots in the country, with a few exceptions, are
to be found among English immigrants and Colonists
of English blood. It is a kind of shooting which
seems incredible at first sight to the ordinary man
from home. I have known such a hunter to put a
bullet at over 100 yards through the head of a
korhaan, a bird scarcely larger than a blackcock: a
feat which might be set down to accident were it not
that the same man was accustomed to shoot small
buck running at 200 yards with remarkable success.
I should be very sorry to wage war against a corps of
sharpshooters drawn from old African hunters.</p>

<p>There remain the numerous game-birds of the
country. The finest is, of course, the greater paauw,
but he is not very common in the Transvaal itself,
though frequent enough in Bechuanaland, Rhodesia,
and some parts of the northern bush veld. But of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
bustard family, to which the comprehensive name of
korhaan is applied, there are at least four varieties,
two of which are very common. The bustard is an
easy bird, save that he carries a good deal of shot, and
has a knack of keeping out of range unless properly
stalked or driven. The Dutch word &ldquo;patrys,&rdquo; again,
covers at least eight varieties of the true partridge,
and if we include the sand-grouse (called the Namaqua
partridge), of two or three more. None of the South
African partridge tribe are equal to their English
brothers; but there is no reason why the English bird
should not be introduced, and thrive well, and indeed
experiments in this direction are being made. There
are three birds which the Dutch call &ldquo;pheasant,&rdquo; two
of them francolins and one the curious dikkop&mdash;birds
which have few of the qualities of the English
pheasant, but which are strong on the wing, offer
fair shots, and make excellent eating. Quail are
found at certain seasons of the year in vast quantities,
and give good sport with dogs; but to my mind the
finest South African bird, excepting of course the
greater paauw, is the guinea-fowl, which the Dutch
call by the quaint and beautiful name of <i>tarentaal</i>.
There are two varieties, fairly well distributed&mdash;the
ordinary crested (<i>Numida coronata</i>) and the blue-headed
(<i>Numida Edouardi</i>). In parts of the bush
veld they may be seen roosting at night on trees so
thickly that the branches are bent with their weight.
When pursued in broken country, what with dodging
among stones and trees and his short unexpected
flight, the guinea-fowl offers some excellent shooting,
and as a table-bird he is not easy to beat. Wildfowl
are an uncertain quantity on the uplands, though very
common nearer the coast. They do not come to the
rivers, but, on the other hand, they frequent in great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
numbers farm dams and the pans and lakes of Standerton
and Ermelo. What the Dutch call specifically
the &ldquo;wilde gans&rdquo; is the Egyptian goose; but several
other varieties, including the spur-winged, are to be
found. There are some ten kinds of duck, but it
would be difficult to say which is the commonest, as
they vary in different districts. The Dutch call a
bird &ldquo;teel&rdquo; which is not the true teal, but the variety
known as the Cape teal (<i>Nettion capense</i>), though
there is more than one kind of proper teal to be met
with. There is a black duck, a variety of pochard, a
variety of shoveller, and a kind of shell-duck which is
known as the mountain duck (<i>bergeend</i>). Wild pigeons
exist in endless quantities; and I must not omit the
pretty spur-winged plover, which cries all day long on
the western veld, or that most cosmopolitan of birds,
the snipe. Along the reed-beds of the Limpopo, in
the bulrushes which fringe the pans in Ermelo, by
every spruit and dam, you may put up precisely the
same fellow that you shoot in Hebridean peat-mosses
or on Swedish lakes, or along the canals of Lower
Egypt. The little brown long-billed bird has annihilated
time and space and taken the whole world for
his home.</p>

<p>There is need of some little care lest we drive the
wild birds altogether away from the neighbourhood of
the towns. They are still plentiful, but, if over-shot,
they change their quarters; and people complain that
whereas five years ago they could get excellent shooting
within three miles of their door, they have now to
content themselves with a few stragglers. It is for
the owners of land to see that its denizens are properly
protected, for the disappearance of big game is an
awful warning not to presume on present abundance.
Some day we may hope to see the country farmer as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
eager to preserve his game as he is now to destroy it.
There needs but the pinch of scarcity and the growth
of a market value for shooting to turn the present
free-and-easy ways into a perhaps too rigorous protective
system.</p>

<p>There remain two sports which are still in their
infancy in the country and deserve serious development&mdash;the
keeping of harriers and angling. I say
harriers advisedly, for though it would be better to
stick to drafts from foxhound packs because of the
greater strength and hardiness of the hounds, yet
the sport can never fairly be dignified by the name
of fox-hunting. The quarries will be the hare, the
small buck, and in certain districts the jackal. The
veld in parts is a fine natural hunting-ground, and
the hazards, which will be wanting in the shape of
hedges and banks, will exist very really in ant-bear
holes and dongas. As the fencing laws take effect
there will be wire to go over for those who have
Australian nerves. The Afrikander pony is an animal
born for the work, and once harrier packs were established
there is every reason to believe that the Dutch
farmers would join in the sport. The only two
reasons I have ever heard urged against the proposal
are&mdash;first, that hounds when brought out to South
Africa lose their noses; and, second, that it would be
hard to get a good scent in the dry air of the veld.
The first is true in a sense, but only because a draft
brought out from home is usually set to work at once
and not acclimatised gradually to the change of air.
There is no inherent impossibility in keeping a dog&rsquo;s
nose good, as is shown by the many excellent setters
and pointers that have been imported. In any case,
if the master of harriers breeds carefully he ought in
a few years to get together a thoroughly acclimatised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
pack. As for the matter of scent, there is no denying
that it would not lie on the ordinary hot dry day,
but this only means that it will not be possible to
hunt all the year round. I can imagine no better
weather than the cool moist days which are common
on the high veld in autumn and early spring, and
even in summer the mornings up to ten o&rsquo;clock are
cool enough for the purpose. South African hunts
must follow the Indian fashion, and when they cannot
get whole days for their sport make the best of the
early hours.</p>

<p>Fishing, I am afraid, has been in the past a
neglected sport. The Boer left it to the Kaffir, and
the uitlander had better things to think about. Had
the land possessed any native fish of the type of
the American brook-trout or the land-locked salmon,
perhaps it would have been different; but in the
high-veld streams the only notable fish are two species
of carp, known as yellow-fish and white-fish, which
run from 2 lb. to 6 lb., and the barbel, which may weigh
anything up to 30 lb.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a
href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> There are also eels, which may
be disregarded. I do not think these South African
fish are to be despised, for though they may be dead-hearted
compared with a trout or a salmon, they give
better sport than English coarse fish, and the barbel
is quite as good as a pike. The ordinary bait is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
mealie-meal paste, a locust or any kind of small
animal, a phantom minnow, and even a piece of
bright rag. I have known both kinds of carp take
a brightly coloured sea-trout fly, and give the angler
a very good run for his pains. But the great South
African fish is the tiger-fish, confined, unhappily, to
sub-tropical rivers and malarial country. He is not
unlike a trout in appearance, save for his fierce head,
which suggests the <i>Salmo ferox</i>. In any of the
eastern rivers&mdash;Limpopo, Letaba, Olifants, Sabi,
Crocodile, Komati, Usutu, Umpilusi&mdash;he is the chief&mdash;indeed,
so far as I could judge, the only&mdash;fish,
and he is one of the most spirited of his tribe. He
will readily take an artificial minnow, and also, I
am told, a large salmon fly, but the tackle must be
at least as strong as for pike, for his formidable teeth
will shear through any ordinary casting line. His
average weight is perhaps about 10 lb., though he
has been caught up to 30 lb., but it is not his size
so much as his extraordinary fierceness and dash
which makes him attractive. When hooked he leaps
from the water like a clean salmon, and for an hour
or more he may lead the perspiring fisherman as
pretty a dance as he could desire. If any one is
inclined to think angling a tame sport, I can recommend
this experiment. Let him go out on some
river like the Komati on a stifling December day,
when the sky is brass above and not a breath of air
breaks the stillness, in one of the leaky and crazy
cobles of those parts. Let him hook and land a
tiger-fish of 20 lb., at the imminent risk of capsizing
and joining the company of the engaging crocodiles,
or, when he has grassed the fish, of having a finger
bitten off by his iron teeth, and then, I think, he
will admit, so far as his scanty breath will allow him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
that an hour&rsquo;s fishing may afford all the excitement
which an average man can support.</p>

<p>So much for the fish of the country. But Central
South Africa affords a magnificent field for the introduction
and acclimatisation of the greatest of sporting
fish. Ceylon and New Zealand have already shown
what can be done with the trout in new waters, and
in Cape Colony and Natal the same experiment has
been made with much success. The high veld is only
less good than New Zealand as a home for trout. To
be sure, there is no snow-water, but there is the next
best thing in water whose temperature varies very
little all the year round. The ordinary sluggish
spruits are of course unsuitable, but the mountain
burns in the east and north are perfect natural trout-streams,
with clear cold water, abundant fall, gravel
bottoms, and all the feeding which the most gluttonous
of fish could desire. The Transvaal Trout
Acclimatisation Society, founded in Johannesburg in
1902, has established a hatchery on the Mooi River
above Potchefstroom, and is making the most praiseworthy
efforts, by the creation of local committees,
to excite a general interest in the work throughout
the country. It will still be some years before any
trout-stream can be stocked and thrown open to
anglers; but there is no reason why in time there
should not be one in most districts. The Mooi and
the Klip rivers near Johannesburg, the Magalies and
the Hex rivers in Rustenburg, the Upper Malmani in
Lichtenburg, every stream in Magatoland and the
Wood Bush, the torrents which fall from Lydenburg
into the flats, and all the many mountain streams
which run into Swaziland from the high veld, may yet
be as good trout-waters as any in Lochaber. The
rainbow and the Lochleven trout will be the staple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
importation; but in some of the larger streams experiments
might be made with the American ouananiche
and the Danubian huchen. It is difficult to exaggerate
the service which might thus be rendered to
the country. If in the dams and streams within
easy distance of the towns a sound form of sport
can be provided at reasonable cost, the first and
greatest of the amenities of life will have been
introduced. At present on the Rand there are no
proper modes of relaxation: most men work till
they drop, and then take their jaded holiday in
Europe. Yet how many, if they had the chance,
would go off from Saturday to Monday with their
rods, and find by the stream-side the old healing
quiet of nature?</p>

<p>There is a future for South African sport if South
Africa is alive to her opportunity. It is a country of
sportsmen, and sport with the better sort of man is a
sound basis of friendship. Game Preservation Societies
are being started in many districts, and when we find
the two races united in a common purpose, which
touches not politics or dogma but the primitive
instincts of humankind, something will have been
done towards unity. The matter is equally important
from the standpoint of game protection. The private
landowner can do more than the land company, and
the land company can do more than the Government,
towards ensuring the future of sport. Many Dutch
farmers have preserved in the past, and a general
extension of this spirit would work wonders in a few
years. Vanishing species would be saved, banished
game would return, and our conscience would be clear
of one of the most heinous sins of civilisation. As an
instance of what can be done by private effort, there
is a farm not sixty miles from a capital city where at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
this moment there are impala, rooi hartebeest, koodoo,
and wild ostrich.</p>

<p>There are few countries in the world where sport
can be enjoyed in more delectable surroundings. The
cold fresh mornings, when the mist is creeping from
the grey hills and the vigour of dawn is in the blood;
the warm sun-steeped spaces at noonday; the purple
dusk, when the veld becomes a kind of Land East of
the Sun and West of the Moon, full of fairy lights and
mysterious shadows; the bitter night, when the
southern constellations blaze in the profound sky,&mdash;he
who has once seen them must carry the memory
for ever. It is such things, and not hunger and thirst
and weariness, which remain in a man&rsquo;s mind. For
the lover of nature and wild things (which is to say
the true sportsman) it is little wonder if, after these,
home and ambition and a comfortable life seem degrees
of the infinitely small. And the others, who are only
brief visitors, will carry away unforgettable pictures
to tantalise them at work and put them out of all
patience with an indoor world&mdash;the bivouac under
the stars on the high veld, or some secret glen of the
Wood Bush, or the long lines of hill which huddle
behind Lydenburg into the sunset.</p>

In other parts of British Africa the policy of reserves has received
full recognition. In East Africa there are two large reserves, one along
the Uganda Railway and the other near Lake Rudolf. In the Soudan
there is a vast reserve between the Blue and the White Niles, and most
of the best shooting-ground throughout the country is strictly protected.</p>

A Transvaal friend informs me that my classification, though the one
commonly in use, is quite inaccurate. The yellow-fish and the white-fish
are not carp but species of barbel, and what I have called barbel is another
variant of the same family, called by the Dutch &ldquo;kalverskop,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;calf&rsquo;s-head,&rdquo; from its shape. There is no true carp, though
the Dutch
give the name of &ldquo;kurper&rdquo; to a very curious little fish about four
inches
long which is common in streams flowing into the Vaal. The other chief
varieties are the coarse mud-fish and the cat-fish, which latter is often
mixed up with the barbel. It is to be hoped that some local ichthyologist
will give his attention to the native fishes&mdash;a very interesting subject,
and one at present in the most unscientific confusion.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<h4>THE ECONOMIC FACTOR.</h4>


<p>After a three years&rsquo; war, and at the cost of over 200
millions, Britain has secured for her own children the
indisputable possession of the new colonies. In earlier
chapters an attempt has been made to sketch roughly
the historical influences which may help to shape the
future and to describe the actual features of the land
which charm and perplex the beholder. We have
now to face the direct problems into which the situation
can be resolved, and in particular that question of
material wellbeing which is the most insistent, because
the most easily realised, for both statesman and people.
The economic factor in the politics of a country is
always a difficult matter to discuss, for it is made up
of infinite details, some of them purely speculative, all
of them hard to disentangle. If a business man were
to do what he never does, and sit down to analyse
calmly his position, he would have to go far beyond
balance-sheets and statements of profit and loss. He
would be compelled to look into the social and
economic conditions under which he lived; he would
have to estimate rival activities and forecast their
development; the money market, rates of exchange,
the nature of the labour supply, the effect of political
and social movements, even such matters as his own
bodily and mental health, and his standing among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
his fellows, would properly make part of the inquiry.
With the private individual the analysis would be
ridiculous, because the component parts are too minute
to realise; but with a nation, where the lines are
broader, some stock-taking of this kind is periodically
desirable. But in spite of, or because of, the complexity
of the inquiry, the human mind is apt to
complicate it needlessly by running after side-issues
and losing sight of the main features of the problem.
The economic position of a country embraces in a sense
almost every detail of human life; but there is no
reason why the mass of detail should be allowed to
get out of focus and obscure the synthesis of the
survey. Provided we remember that the economic
factor is not correctly estimated by looking only at
revenue and expenditure, imports and exports, and
fiscal provisions, we may safely devote our energies to
steering clear of the labyrinth of secondary detail
in which the ordinary statistician would seek to
involve us.</p>

<p>In the following pages it is proposed to confine the
survey to what appear to be the main features of a
complex question. It would be vain to embark on
speculations as to the payable ore in the ground,
market forecasts, suggestions for new industries, and
the many hints towards a reformed fiscal system with
which local and European papers have been crowded.
It is sufficient to note the existence of such questions;
the materials for a true understanding of the South
African economy are not to be found in them. In
particular it is proposed to avoid needless statistics,
which, apart from the fact that they are often inaccurate
and partisan, are the buttress of that
particularist logic which is the foe of true reason.
Two questions may be taken as the general heads of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
our inquiry: first, Wherein consists the wealth of the
land, actual and potential? and, secondly, How best
may that wealth be maintained and developed for the
national good?</p>


<h5>I.</h5>

<p>The cardinal economic fact is the existence of gold&mdash;gold
as it is found in no other country, not in casual
pockets and reefs, but in quantities which can for the
most part be accurately mapped out and valued
months and years before it is worked; gold which is
mined not as an adventure, but as an organised and
stable industry. The Main Reef formation extends
for sixty-two miles, from Randfontein to Holfontein,<a name="FNanchor_15_15"
id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
but three-fourths of the gold mined has been produced
in the central section, which is only some twelve miles
long. In 1886 the district was proclaimed a public
gold-field, and since that day ore worth nearly 100
millions sterling has been extracted. The development
took place in spite of difficulties which vastly increased
the working costs. The dynamite and railway monopolies,
the heavy expense of the transit of machinery
from the coast, the absence of subsidiary local industries
to feed the gold industry, forced the work into
the hands of a small circle of rich firms who could
provide the large capital and face the heavy risks of a
new enterprise. It is clear, therefore, that mining on
the Rand, while a notable enterprise, has necessarily
been a slow one, since the two natural factors, the
amount of gold in the soil and the labour of working
it, have been complicated by many artificial hindrances.
The past is not the true basis for estimating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the future of the industry; the proper premises for a
forecast are the two natural factors&mdash;the quantity of
gold in the earth and the normal cost of winning it.
It is the first that concerns us at present.</p>

<p>All estimates must be merely conjectural, and can
be used only with the greatest caution. But in the
multitude of conjectures there may be such a consensus
of opinion as to ensure us a fair certainty that
this or that is the view of those who are best fitted to
judge. Mr Bleloch, in a calculation based on the
report of the most eminent engineers, values the
amount of gold still in the Rand at 2871 millions
sterling, showing a profit to the companies concerned
of over 975 millions. If we put the life of the Rand
at one hundred years, which is a mean between conflicting
estimates, we shall have an average, allowing
for reserve funds, of 8 millions to be paid yearly in
dividends to shareholders. In 1898 twenty-six companies
paid dividends amounting to over 4 millions:
therefore, on Mr Bleloch&rsquo;s figures, we can promise at
least one hundred years to the Rand of twice the prosperity
of 1898. These figures include the deep levels,
but do not take into account any of the Rand extensions,
in which the Main Reef has been traced for
over 300 miles. It is certain that in the direction
of Heidelberg and Greylingstad gold in payable
quantities exists for not less than seventy miles, and
it is at least probable that a similar extension exists
in the Potchefstroom and Klerksdorp districts in the
west. So much for the peculiar &ldquo;banket&rdquo; formation
of the Rand, which must remain the type of stable
gold-mining,&mdash;stable, because the element of uncertainty
over any group of properties is reduced to a
minimum, and the high organisation necessary and
the large initial outlay produce a community less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of rivals than of fellow-workers. Quartz reefs and
alluvial deposits are found in many parts of the
country. In Lydenburg and Barberton, where the
earliest gold mines were sunk, several producing
companies are at work; and this type of mining
will develop equally with the Rand under a system
which abolishes monopolies and assists instead of
discouraging enterprise. In the northern districts,
around the Wood Bush and the Zoutpansberg ranges,
there are quartz and alluvial mining, and indications
of &ldquo;banket&rdquo; formation, and in the all but
unknown region adjoining Portuguese territory, if
tales be true, there may be gold in quantities still
undreamed of.</p>

<p>No figures are reliable, all estimates are disputed,
but from the very contradictions one fact emerges&mdash;that
there is gold enough to give employment to a
greatly increased mining population for at least fifty
years, and to decentralise the industry and create
large industrial belts instead of one industrial city.
Nor is gold the only mineral. From Pretoria to Piet
Retief run coal-beds, many of them of great richness
and good quality, covering an area of more than
10,000 square miles. It has been calculated that
60,000 million tons are available. The quality of the
coal in the undeveloped beds lying to the south of
Middelburg is, in the opinion of experts, equal to the
best British product. Iron-ore is abundant in many
parts, particularly in the coal-bearing regions of the
east. Lead has been worked near Zeerust, and there
are good grounds for believing that copper in large
quantities exists in Waterberg and in the tract
between Pietersburg and the Limpopo. Diamond
pipes are found in several places in the region due
east of Pretoria, where the new Premier Mine seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
to promise a richness not equalled by Kimberley; and
it is probable that places like the Springbok Flats and
the western parts of Christiana are highly diamondiferous.
Sapphires have been found in the west, and
diamonds and spinels are reported from the northern
mountains. Few countries have a soil more amply
mineralised; but the sparse population, mainly
absorbed in the quest of one mineral, has done little
to exploit its wealth. Mining, save for gold and coal,
is still in the Transvaal a thing of the future. The
agricultural and pastoral wealth is dealt with in
another chapter. But we may note an asset, which
is wholly undeveloped, in the cultivation and protection
of the natural wood of the north and east, and
the planting of imported trees. Timber in an inland
mining country is a valuable product, and on the soil
of the high veld new plantations spring up like
mushrooms. Ten feet a-year is the common rate of
growth for gums, and in the warmer tracts it is nearer
twenty. Many indigenous South African trees, which
a few years ago, under an unwise system of timber
concessions, were disappearing from most places save
a few sequestered glens in the north, might under
proper care become a lucrative branch of forestry.
Current estimates, rough and inaccurate as they
must be, are the fruit of a very general conviction,
which on the broadest basis is amply supported by
facts. There is sufficient natural wealth&mdash;mineral,
pastoral, and agricultural&mdash;to provide a sound industrial
foundation for the new States. It is only on
the details of its exploitation that experts differ.</p>

<p class="smlpadt">In any calculation of natural wealth there is another
factor to be noted which controls production and dictates
its method. Whatever the natural riches of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
country may be, climate and situation must be weighed
in their practical estimate. A diamond pipe at the
South Pole and acres of rich soil in Tibet are practically
as valueless as a fine anchorage on the Sahara
coast or a bracing climate in Tierra del Fuego. In
the new colonies we have throughout three-fourths of
their area a climate where white men can labour out of
doors all the year round. The remaining fourth is less
pestilential than many places in Ceylon, Burma, and
the Malay Peninsula, where Europeans live and work.
There are certain very real climatic disadvantages&mdash;frequent
thunderstorms, hailstorms in summer when
fruits and crops are ripening, rains concentrated over
a few months, a long, dusty, waterless winter. But
these are difficulties which can be surmounted for the
most part by human ingenuity, and at the worst they
place no absolute bar on enterprise. From the standpoint
of health the climate is nearly perfect, inducing
a vigour and alertness of body and mind which in the
more feverish life of cities may ruin the nerves and
prematurely age a man, but in all wholesome forms of
labour enable work to be done at a maximum pressure
and with the minimum discomfort. In valuing, therefore,
the natural assets of the new colonies, we need
write off nothing for climatic hindrances. The situation
is a more doubtful matter. They pay for their
freedom from the low heats of the coast by the absence
of private outlets for trade and the consequent
difficulties which all people must meet who have to
hire others to do their shipping and carrying. It is
not the difficulty of Missouri or Ohio or other inland
states in one territory, but of separate peoples, with
interests often conflicting, who have to submit to
weary customs and railway arrangements before their
outlet can exist. This is one, perhaps the only,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
genuine natural limitation which all schemes of economic
development must take account of.</p>

<p>The country is not new, and therefore in sketching
its natural wealth we do not exhaust the preliminaries
of the question. There are ready-made industrial conditions
to be considered which may modify our estimate
of the initial equipment. Such are the commercial
structures already built up in the great commercial
centre, which for this purpose represents the new
colonies; the nature and future of the labour supply;
the existing markets; the already prepared means of
transit. The gold industry, as was to be expected from
its nature, has fallen into the hands of a few houses.
Eight great financial groups control the wealth of the
Rand: the Eckstein group alone has interests which
might be capitalised at 70 millions; the Consolidated
Gold-fields at about 30 millions. The reason for this
state of affairs is obvious. Gold-mining in the Rand
fashion is a costly business, and altogether beyond the
reach of the small man: claims were bought up by the
financiers who were first in possession, and, since they
were able to hold and develop, the entry of other
financial houses has been blocked. But the great
mining firms do not confine their activity to gold.
They own millions of acres of land throughout the
country, and many valuable building sites in the
towns. Originally, doubtless, land was bought purely
as a mining speculation, but they are not slow, in the
absence of minerals, to make out of it what they can.
These Rand houses are the bugbear of a certain class
of politician. The Rand is closed to the small man, so
runs the cry; a system of trusts is being created; in
a little while the country will be under the iron heel
of a financial ring. It is assumed that the mining
firms will turn their attention to ordinary commerce,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
and oust the independent trader and cultivator and
the small manufacturer. Certain trading experiments
by some of the chief houses, and an attempt to grow
food-supplies for their own employees, give a certain
support to the forecast.</p>

<p>If the Trust system in its American form were ever
to become a reality in South Africa, the obvious and
infallible checks against too wide an expansion would
arise there as elsewhere. A trust can only exist in full
strength under its originators. There can be no apostolic
succession in trust management; the second or
the third generation must be on a lower scale, and the
great fabric will crumble. A huge combination can
only be maintained by perpetual energy and ceaseless
labour, and, like the empire of Charlemagne, it will
dwindle under a successor. A trust can be created
but not perpetuated. No group of directors, no paid
manager, can maintain the nicety of judgment and the
sleepless care which alone can preserve from decay an
artificial structure imposed upon an unwilling society.
But in the case of the new colonies there are special
reasons which make this development highly improbable.
A trust flourishes only on highly protected
soil, and Free Trade must long be predominant in the
Transvaal. Again, while there can never be a trust in
gold, the market being unlimited and beyond any
possibility of control, gold-mining must remain the
chief interest for any group of firms who desired to
establish a trust in other commodities. Now gold-mining
is one-third an industry and two-thirds a
scientific inquiry. An ordinary trust is concerned
less with production than with the control of the
markets and the methods of distribution. But all
progress in Rand mining depends on nice and speculative
scientific calculation. To reduce the working
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
costs by improved appliances, so that ore of a low
grade may become payable, is so vital a matter with
every great firm which is concerned in gold-mining,
that the commercial or trust side, which must be
concerned not with gold but with other forms of production,
is not likely to be given undue prominence.
Human capacity is limited, and no man or body of
men can meet these two very different classes of problems
at the same time. The experiments of mining
firms in other trades have been due far more to the
immense cost of imports and the absence of subsidiary
industries than to a Napoleonic desire for consolidation.
There is room, abundant room, in the Transvaal
for ironworks and factories, for the private trader and
the independent farmer; and the bogey of the great
houses resolves itself in practice into little more than a
stimulating example in progressive business methods.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks do not, however, touch the
question whether or not the gold industry is to remain
a preserve of a few groups. If it is, there can be little
real objection. The market for gold can never be controlled
like the diamond-market, and there is small
fear of a gold-mining De Beers dictating to the world.
Moreover, the great groups are not static but mobile,
constantly dividing and subdividing, throwing off subsidiary
companies and adding new ones, no more
monopolists than the cotton-spinners of Manchester
or the shipbuilders of Glasgow. The fact remains
that they own most of the mining rights in the country,
and all development must lie very much in their hands.
The owner of the minerals on a farm in Potchefstroom
is at liberty to form a company and work them himself.
But the case will be uncommon, since the bulk
of the mineral rights are already absorbed, and, on
the Rand system of mining, an unknown adventurer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
would have difficulty in raising the large initial
capital. It is only in this sense that there is any
meaning in the charge of monopoly. A more real
grievance is that a great house will often buy up claims
throughout the country and leave them unworked till
it suits its pleasure, thereby hindering industrial development.
This, in a sense, is true, but the reason is
to be found mainly in the difficulty of development
under recent conditions,&mdash;conditions which, for the
matter of that, would have pressed far more hardly on
the small man than on the rich firms. So far as the
gold industry is concerned, the plaint of the humble
citizen on this score is a little ridiculous. He asks
an impossibility, and in his heart admits the folly of
the request.</p>

<p>It is time that the anti-capitalist parrot-cry were
recognised in its true meaning. On the Rand it is
not the wail of a downtrodden proletariat or of the
industrious small merchant whose occupation is gone.
It is the dishonest agitation of a speculating class
who find their activity limited by the strenuous and
rational policy of the great houses. I would suggest
as a fair parallel the outcry of small and disreputable
publicans in a rising town where it has been found
profitable to open good restaurants and decent hotels.
Without capital the Transvaal is a piece of bare
veld; with capital wrongly applied it is a hunting-ground
for the adventurer and the bogus-promoter.
The gold industry depends on capital, because only
capital combined with intelligence and patience could
have raised it from a speculation to an industry. But
facts are the most eloquent form of apologetics. At
the moment over 30 millions have been spent on
development by producing companies, leaving out of
account the large administrative and office expenses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
How much has been spent in the same way on mines
which have not reached the producing stage it is
impossible to say, but the figure must be very large.
To start an ordinary deep-level mine costs nearly a
million before any profits are made. Surely it is right
to see in an organisation which is prepared to face
such an outlay some qualities of courage and patience.
It is possible that the great houses may find themselves
in conflict with the best public opinion on certain
matters before the day is done; but it is well to recognise
that the very existence of an industrial population
is due to capital wisely and patiently used by the
strong men who were the makers of the country.</p>

<p class="smlpadt">Last in our calculation of assets comes the existing
or accessible machinery of exploitation and production&mdash;the
labour supply, the means of transit, the available
markets. The first is a complicated matter on which
it is hard to dogmatise. For some months it has been
the most strenuously canvassed of South African
problems. On its solution depends without doubt
not only the future prosperity but the immediate
insolvency of the country. And at the same time,
being bound up more than other economic questions
with far-reaching political interests, its solution has
become less a commercial adjustment than a piece of
national policy. As was to be expected in this kind
of discussion, the true issues have been habitually
obscured. The antithesis is not between labour and
no labour, but in one aspect between the cheap,
unskilled native and the dear, more highly skilled
white; and in another between a limited supply,
which means the curtailment of enterprise, and an
unlimited supply, even of a lower quality, which
would allow full development. Again, the antithesis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
is not absolute, as has been often assumed: the true
solution may lie in a compromise, a delicate cutting
of the coat to suit the particular cloths employed in
its making.</p>

<p>It is almost entirely a mining question. In most
other industries the work can be done by white men
with the assistance of a few natives. In agriculture,
as things stand at present, sufficient native labour
can be procured, and under an improved system of
taxation the supply might be largely increased,
within limits. The demand in agriculture should
diminish rather than increase, save in the tropical
and sub-tropical regions, where native labour is
always plentiful. On the high veld a single farmer,
if he ploughs with oxen, wants a boy as a voorlooper
and another to use the whip; but this and similar
work may well be performed in time by his own sons
or by white servants. Railway construction will draw
heavily on the supply, but its requirements are, after
all, limited and small in comparison with the immense
needs of the mines. For in the latter a very large
number of employees is necessary, the bulk of the
work is unskilled, and the conditions under which
it must be performed are frequently such as to deter
the ordinary European. The case is not quite that
of labour in the West Indian plantations with which
it has been compared, but there are many points of
resemblance. The labour, on the current view, must
be cheap; it must exist in large quantities; and the
work is bound in certain respects to be hard and
unpleasant&mdash;not perhaps harder than coal-mining
in England, but, taking into account the superior
average of comfort in the new colonies, indubitably
more unattractive to the local workman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the war some 90,000 natives were employed
in the Witwatersrand mines. The average cost was
from 1s. 6d. to 2s. a-day, food and lodging being
provided; but the expense of acquiring the labour
considerably raised the actual price per man. The
old method was by a system of touts, who were
paid as much as #5 a-head for their importation.
The system led to great abuses, chicanery, needless
competition false promises, which often cut off the
supply in a whole territory. To meet the difficulty
the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association was
formed, whose duties were to recruit native labour
and distribute it equitably to the mines within the
association. Its agents were paid by salaries instead
of by results, and the various native locations in the
Transvaal, Swaziland, and Portuguese territory were
exploited by them. But with all its efforts the mines
were inadequately supplied. The 90,000 natives
barely sufficed to maintain the <i>status quo</i>, and there
was no margin for new development. The war
scattered the accumulated supply. The local natives
grew rich in military service, and declined to leave
their kraals. Those imported from a distance returned
to their homes, and the whole work of collection had
to begin again. In October 1902, which may be taken
as a fair date to estimate the condition of things after
the war, only 31,000 natives were at work, one-third
of the former staff. By May 1903, after herculean
efforts, the supply had increased to a little over
41,000.</p>

<p>The problem is, therefore, a very serious one. To
return to the old state of things the present supply
must be doubled; to provide for any adequate progress
it must at the lowest estimate be multiplied by
ten. Any wholesale increase to the mining wealth of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the country must come from the exploital of the deep
level and the low-grade properties. The working costs
per ton of ore run from 17s. 6d. to 30s.; on the Rand
the average is about 27s.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a
href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But the ordinary low-grade
mines produce ore worth little more than 18s.
to 20s. a-ton. To make their development possible the
working cost must be reduced to 15s.-17s. Improved
machinery may do something, but the first necessity
is cheap labour. But where are the natives to come
from? The efforts of the Native Labour Associations
have not succeeded in showing that the need can be
met from any of the old supply grounds. New taxation
and the spending of their war savings may drive
some of the Transvaal natives to the mines; but as
the total native population of the colony is only about
three quarters of a million, the whole working male
force, which may be taken at one in ten, would not
meet the demand. In addition to this we have the
fact that no taxation would reach more than one-half
of the population, and that of this half three-quarters
is probably unfit for mining work. The total native
population south of the Zambesi is at the present
moment a little over 6 millions. Supposing this
field were worked to the uttermost, we should still
scarcely meet the demands likely to arise within the
next five years for the gold industry alone; and such
exhaustive exploitation is beyond the wildest dream
of any Chamber of Mines.</p>

<p>The case may be stated thus. With all assistance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
from local taxation and from the amended organisation
of the Native Labour Association, Africa, south
of the Zambesi, will be unable to afford the unlimited
supply of native labour which is the <i>sine qub non</i> of
mining progress. It would therefore appear that a
new ground of supply must be sought. By those who
admit this (and as will appear later, there are some
who do not) three solutions have been advocated,
none of which is unattended with difficulties. The
first is to find a recruiting-ground in the vast district
between the Zambesi and the White Nile, a region
more densely populated by the aborigines than any
other part of Africa. This scheme has been urged
by Sir Harry Johnston with all the weight of his
unrivalled experience. The advantages of the solution
are numerous. Those natives live directly
or indirectly under British sway. They are unsophisticated,
and the old rate of wages would mean
undreamed-of wealth to them. Moreover, the experiment
would be of a certain assistance to Central
Africa, for on their return home with their wages
money would be put into circulation, the standard
of living would rise, taxes would be easier to collect,
and Government and governed would mutually profit.
On the other hand, there are very many reasons
against the proposal. Uganda and Nyassaland, to
take the two chief instances, are in need of labour
for their own development, and will strenuously resist
its exportation. Their nascent civilisation will
be dislocated if they are made the hunting-ground
of labour agents. Nor is it clear that the Central
African native is suited for mining purposes, since
both in constitution and the food he lives on he
differs from his southern kinsman, and, in the opinion
of many good authorities, his transplantation to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
high veld would mean a swollen death-rate. Overtures
have also been made to Northern and Southern
Nigeria, but the answer from those territories is
still more hopeless. It is too early to pronounce on
the future of the Central African scheme. A fair
<i>prima facie</i> case can be made out for its success,
and the result of the first experiments has not been
wholly discouraging. But in any case it is certain
that from this source no unlimited or permanent
supply can come. A modicum, perhaps gradually
increasing, may be secured, and in this day of small
things we can be thankful for any increase in native
African labour. But great care is necessary in its
working. There must be no hint of coercion; the
native must be vigilantly looked after from the day
he leaves his kraal to the day he returns at the
end of his twelvemonth&rsquo;s service,&mdash;for the districts
must be nursed, and it is on the report of the first
batches that the success of the enterprise depends.
The transport will cost money, but it is doubtful
if it will work out at more per head than the old
premium for importation.</p>

<p>The second solution has roused a storm of opposition,
and its adoption would mean the overthrow of
the old economics of the mining industry. It is proposed
to use Kaffirs only in the deepest levels and in
work unsuited for white men (for which the present
supply will suffice), and in all other tasks to employ
white labour. The white workman on the Rand
under present conditions will be more than four times
as dear as the native, costing 8s. 6d. as against the
Kaffir&rsquo;s 2s. a-day. Many arguments to justify the expense
have been brought forward, of which the weakest
is that the white man can do four times the Kaffir&rsquo;s
work. In many branches of unskilled labour he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
can barely compete with him. The real argument
is concerned with the more general aspects of the
problem. In a highly organised industry there is
bound to be a higher maximum efficiency and regularity
from a staff of white employees, who are working
intelligently to better themselves and have certain
political and social interests at stake in their labour.
On political grounds, again, it is most desirable, for
apart from relieving the strain on congested home
districts, it would provide a feeding-ground for South
African development, a material wherewith to colonise
the wilds of the north. The sons of the white
men would go out to farm and mine for themselves;
and in two generations, when the Rand has become a
normal industrial centre, we should have that interchange
of population between town and country which
is one of the buttresses of civilisation.</p>

<p>The white labour movement has roused bitter opposition,
partly from the mining houses, and to some
extent from white workmen on the Rand, who wish to
make a monopoly of their position. Many of the arguments
against the scheme need not detain us. There is
no objection to white and black labour working side by
side, any more than there is an objection on a tropical
fruit-farm to a white man digging an orchard and a
Kaffir carting manure for it, or on board ship to a
white mate and a black cook being part of the same
crew. The white man will have the presence of his
fellows, the chance of advancement, and a higher wage
to support his self-respect, which must be a brittle
article indeed if it requires further strengthening.
Nor is there much justification for the fears of those
who see in white labour the beginning of endless
labour troubles, culminating in the tyranny of the
working man. The situation would be the same as in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
any other industrial city&mdash;as in Manchester, Sheffield,
or Glasgow, where the bulk of the population are
industrial employees. Strikes and lock-outs will come,
but it is better to have in an English city a free and
vigorous English population, than to bolster up the
chief industry by an exotic labour system. Besides,
there is always the Kaffir as a counterfoil, a very
strong argument to inspire moderation in the labourer&rsquo;s
demands. White labour remains the ideal, the proper
aim of all right-thinking men; but for the present it
is more or less an impossibility. It simply does not
meet the economic difficulty. Unless the Mines are
content to make the <i>gran rifiuto</i>, curtail production,
and play a waiting game,&mdash;a decision, as we
shall see, quite as ruinous to the country as to the
shareholder,&mdash;cheap labour under present conditions is
a sheer necessity. One argument on economic grounds
has been brought forward for white labour, which runs
somewhat as follows: Expansion and development
depend upon an unlimited labour-supply; white labour
gives such an unlimited supply,&mdash;therefore it would
pay to give four times the present wage and secure
expansion rather than keep to the old scale and stagnate.
Supposing a mining group to have a capital of
ten millions, of which four are sunk in working mines,
three held in reserve, and three invested in good but
undeveloped claims. The present state of things
allows of a dividend of 40 per cent on the first four
millions; white labour would reduce the dividend to
20 per cent. But if white labour allowed the exploital
of the unworked claims, so that a dividend of 20 to 25
per cent could be paid on the other six millions, it
would be good business for the firm. It would, but
it is not the problem before us. The argument
assumes that the new properties are of the same class
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
as those at present paying dividends, whereas they
are in the main of so low a grade or demand such
an immense initial outlay that, so far from showing
a profit with dear labour, they would be the ruin
of their promoters.</p>

<p>The third proposal is to introduce Chinese<a name="FNanchor_17_17"
id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
labour
under short-time contracts and a rigorous supervision.
Its supporters argue with much reason that the Chinaman
has been found useful as a deep-level miner; that
he is thrifty, intelligent, law-abiding, and tolerably
clean; that, supposing 200,000 Chinamen were employed
in the mines, it would still mean not less than
40,000 white workers, so that white labour would
increase in a liberal ratio; that a proper compound
system and a strict limit to the term of engagement
would secure the country against the economic dangers
which threaten Australia and the United States. It
is not yet certain that this ample supply of Chinese
labour can be obtained, the matter being in process of
investigation; but there is this to be said for the
proposal, that it is the only one which touches directly
the needs of the situation. The others are counsels
of perfection, ends of policy on which all are agreed;
this alone offers an immediate satisfaction to a very
pressing want. The only argument which can be
brought against it is not economic<a name="FNanchor_18_18"
id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> but
political,&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
its use would endanger the success of those very aims
on which all are agreed. The Chinese are the born
interlopers of the world. Whatever care we take
there will be a leakage: a Chinese population, more
feared, apparently, for its virtues than its vices, will
grow up in the cities, the small trades will be shut to
Europeans, the whole standard of life for the masses
will be lowered, and the moral and social currency of
the nation debased. The real case, therefore, of the
opponent of Chinese labour, is that it is not possible
to carry out the proposed plan; that we cannot import
men on a fixed contract and deport them at the end of
it; that we cannot build our compound walls so high
as to prevent a leakage into the outer world; that, in
short, the law is too weak to do its duty. There is no
difference between any of the disputants on the danger
of letting the labour loose in the country; but the one
side maintains that with proper precaution this peril
can be averted, the other that it is like the sea when
it has found an entrance into a sea-wall, a little trickle
which inevitably becomes a deluge. It is not a very
convincing contention, though we can respect the
honest political instincts which support it; indeed,
there is a touch of that familiar fallacy, the &ldquo;thin-end-of-the-
wedge&rdquo;
argument, which opposes an undoubtedly
beneficent reform because of its possible
maleficent extension. The conflict is between an
instant economic need and a potential political danger,
and, with all desire to move cautiously, the wisest
course would seem to be to meet the one, and trust
to the good sense and courage of the people to avert
the other. The problem of alien labour is indeed
becoming a familiar one to many Crown Colonies.
The Colonial Office has been asked to sanction the importation
of Chinamen to Ashanti, and the Rhodesian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Immigration Ordinance of 1901 made the enterprise
legal for Southern Rhodesia.<a name="FNanchor_19_19"
id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> In
the Transvaal there
is a unique field for an experiment on sane and politic
lines, and for the creation of a sound administrative
precedent for other colonies to follow. There is a
result, too, which may reasonably be hoped for from
the provision of cheap labour which would be of direct
political value. It would enable some of the smaller
properties throughout the country to be worked at a
profit, and so might in time redeem the gold industry
from the capitalist monopoly, which it must remain
under present conditions, and create a class of small
mine-owners, on the analogy of the small coal-owners
in England.</p>

<p>There is one final argument against imported labour
which demands a short notice, for it has been used
by many serious men who are not given to captious
objections. If we take the original capital of most
mines we shall find that it has been extensively
watered, and that even on the nominal capital there
is a huge appreciation. A mine, to take an extreme
instance, begins with a capital of #50,000 in #1
shares; subsequently the shareholders receive eleven
#5 shares for every #1 share, making the present
nominal capital #2,750,000. The quotation of those
#5 shares is, say, #10&#8542;, making the total capital
value #5,981,250. A gold output which, under
present conditions, is not sufficient to pay a fair
dividend upon this capitalisation, would be amply
sufficient to pay a dividend on the nominal capital,
and more than sufficient to pay 500 per cent on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the original capital. The question, therefore, of
dividend-paying is out of all relation to the actual
margin of profit on the working of a mine. The
deduction is that the companies have themselves to
blame, and must face a depreciation in their shares;
and the unfortunate investor who has bought #5
shares at #10, believing a return of 4 per cent on
his capital certain, must console himself with the
reflection that every man must pay for his folly.
This argument is final against any <i>ad misericordiam</i>
plea of the companies, but it does not touch the
heart of the question. The working of the large
over-capitalised properties is one thing, and the
development of low-grade properties, on which large
sums have been spent and for which no profits have
yet been earned, is quite another. The old well-established
mines can afford to fight their own
battles, and for the matter of that, in spite of their
heavy expenditure out of capital during the war,
are mostly paying dividends even under present
conditions: the new properties, on which the future
of the country depends, are not, as a rule, over-capitalised,
and, as we have seen, the margin of
profit is so small on each ton of ore, that the
question is reduced to its bare essentials&mdash;Is it
possible to mine ore worth twenty shillings at a
cost under a pound? But even as concerns the
richer companies the argument is scarcely valid, for
it leaves out of account that not inconsiderable factor,
the credit of the country. It is so essential that
new capital should be attracted for the twenty
different needs of development, to which any Government
loan can only be a trifling contribution, that
anything which tends to shake the confidence of
the world in the commercial structure of South
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Africa is the gravest danger. Is it certain, too,
that that much-abused epithet of &ldquo;<i>bonb fide</i> investor&rdquo;
is not applicable to the men who bought high-priced
securities, not as a speculation, but as a modest
investment?</p>

<p>It is often said by opponents of imported labour
that its introduction will scarcely have taken place
before an agitation will be begun for its withdrawal.
So far from being an argument against the experiment,
this is precisely the strongest which could be
urged in its favour. If the desire of the country
is for white labour, then the Chinaman can be tried
with little danger. The mine-owners will find in
time that work on a time contract by alien labourers
is far from satisfactory, and when other circumstances
permit they will no doubt readily adopt that system
of free competitive labour which only a white industrial
class can create. Had there been any chance
of the experiment being tried with complete popular
approval, then the danger would have been considerable,
for the Chinaman might easily have spread
from mining to all industries and trades; but since
it will be made in spite of an influential opposition,
and will be jealously watched by unfriendly eyes, it
seems inevitable that when it has played its part
it will be willingly dispensed with. By refusing to
accept the experiment we are doing our best to
frustrate all hopes of a white population by cramping
the development of the country at its most
critical time and making a livelihood impossible for
many of the existing white working men. When
mines are shut down because of a lack of underground
labourers, what becomes of the Englishmen
who work above ground? It is a significant fact
that many white miners, who were formerly the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
most bitter opponents of imported labour, are now
its strenuous advocates, since they and their class
are beginning to feel the pinch.</p>

<p>But if the importation of Asiatics is undertaken,
it should be on a very clear understanding and with
a very distinct object in view. The thing is far too
dangerous at the best to be made the domain of
unconsidered experiments. The ideal of white labour
in the long-run must be preserved; and we must
take jealous care that by the creation of a foreign
labouring class the way is not barred to that industrialisation
of the native races on which the
future of South Africa so largely depends. A
maximum might be fixed by law&mdash;say 300,000
unskilled labourers, which could be increased if
necessary by later enactments; and in so far as the
maximum could not be attained by white and black
labour, Chinese might be imported as a complement.
The complement would, let us hope, rapidly decrease
as new machinery lessened the amount of labour
required, and the native districts of Africa were
more fully exploited. All imported labour would be
subject to rigorous conditions as to compounds, length
of contract, and ultimate repatriation&mdash;conditions
which any ordinary police could enforce without
difficulty. At the same time, the Native Labour
Association should be made a Government department.
As a private organisation it is not more
efficient, and it is certainly less respected, than a
Government department would be. What is wanted
in all proper recruiting is the prestige of the Crown.
Natives, who have been often deceived by touts, and
regard the offers of the Labour Association agents
as so many idle words, would be ready enough to
listen to proposals made under the guarantee of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
paramount chief. It is a risky game for a Government
to embark in private business; but the Native
Labour Association is not a business, but a department,
conducted on the lines of a Government
department, but without its prestige. Under the
Crown its organisation would remain intact, but its
status would be raised and its efficiency centupled.</p>

<p class="smlpadt">The railway system, immature as it is, has worked
wonders for the country. With few lines, and those
single and narrow gauge, with exorbitant rates of
transit and a frequently ineffective organisation, it
has still above all other factors made development
possible. In former days, when heavy mining
machinery had to be brought by waggons from
Kimberley or Natal or Delagoa Bay, a mine required
to be rich indeed before it could be worked at a profit,
enterprise was costly and perilous, and the result was
the stagnation of all activities save that one where
enterprise was a primal necessity. Under the late
Governments one line ran through the two States,
from Norval&rsquo;s Pont to Pietersburg, with small branch
lines in the Orange Free State to Winburg and Heilbron,
and in the Transvaal to Springs and Klerksdorp.
The Natal line was continued from Charlestown to
join the trunk line at Elandsfontein, and the Delagoa
Bay line from Komati Poort to Pretoria, with a little
branch to Barberton and the beginnings of a branch to
the Selati gold-fields. The Transvaal had thus three
direct outlets to the coast; the Orange Free State
two, for a branch ran from the Natal line at Ladysmith
to the little eastern town of Harrismith. Two
broad necessities of railway policy therefore awaited
the new Government. The existing system must be
perfected and interconnected, new routes to the coast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
created to relieve the present strain, the railways of
adjoining colonies brought into touch with each other,
so as to make one general and consistent South African
system. But more important than the perfecting of
existing arrangements must be the tapping of the rich
and remote districts. Occasionally both needs may be
exemplified in one line, but, roughly speaking, they
are separate branches of railway policy, undertaken on
different grounds and in many cases organised and
financed on different methods. The experience of the
United States, where railways were regarded as the
cause and not the consequence of development, and
pushed boldly into desert places which in a few years,
through their agency, became centres of industry and
population, is a safe guide, within limits, for South
Africa, provided that the wealth to be exploited is
really there, and railway extension does not cripple
other works of equal necessity.</p>

<p>Of the first class we have three chief examples.
One&mdash;from Machadodorp to Ermelo&mdash;is already partially
constructed. The second will run from Springs
east to some point on this line, and so provide a direct
route for the Johannesburg traffic from Delagoa Bay
and avoid the awkward circuit by Pretoria. A further
extension is projected by which the Springs-Ermelo
line will be continued through Swaziland to Delagoa
Bay and a complete alternative through route created.
The third is the extension of the present Klerksdorp
branch to Fourteen Streams, which would provide a
shorter route from the Transvaal to the Cape, an infinitely
shorter route from the Transvaal to Rhodesia,
and would at the same time bring the coal districts of
the country within reach of the diamond industry of
Kimberley. In the second class there is no limit to
the number of possible and desirable railways. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
most important is, perhaps, the grain line, from Bloemfontein
to Johannesburg by Ficksburg, Bethlehem, and
Wilge River, which would bring the great wheat-producing
tracts of the Conquered Territory within easy
reach of the chief market. Next comes the now completed
Rand coal line from Vereeniging to Johannesburg.
Another coal line is projected from Witbank
on the Delagoa Bay line to Springs, which would
bring the produce of the chief Transvaal collieries
directly to the Rand and relieve the congested line
between Elandsfontein and Pretoria. Of equal importance
in the long-run is a line from Krugersdorp
by Rustenburg to some point, such as Lobatsi, on the
Rhodesian railway, which would open up a district
famous for its fruits and tobacco, and give the pastoralists
of Bechuanaland, as well as of the more
distant Rhodesia, a straight line to Johannesburg.
Other lines of the same class are those from Belfast
or Machadodorp to Lydenburg, from Nelspruit to
Pilgrims&rsquo; Rest, and from Basutoland to Bloemfontein.
Lastly, and lastly only because of its greater difficulty,
the line should be continued north from Pietersburg
along the Sand River, brought east between the
Spelonken and the Magatoland mountains, past the
little township of Louis Trichard, and then turned
south across the basin of the Klein and the Groot
Letaba to Leydsdorp, where it could join the completed
Selati railway from Komati Poort.</p>

<p>The Railway Extension Conference held at Johannesburg
in March 1903 sanctioned the immediate
construction of most of the lines mentioned above, and
recommended the others as objects to aim at when
sufficient funds were at the disposal of the Government.
As the share of the Guaranteed Loan allocated
for railway extension is only some five millions, and as
the proportion of any railway surplus which can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
devoted to the purpose is, as we shall see later,
strictly limited, it is highly desirable to make use of
private enterprise so far as possible in new constructions,
providing always for an efficient State
oversight and an ultimate expropriation. The Klerksdorp-Fourteen
Streams and the Krugersdorp-Lobatsi
railways have already been arranged for on this
principle, and it is probable that the experiment will
be adopted in many of the smaller development lines.
It is reasonable that a rich company, owning lands
or mines, or requiring for its own purposes some
special railway connection, should, if it desires a new
line, undertake the financing of it. But at the
same time the principle of the ultimate State
ownership of all railways should be strictly adhered
to, for the very good reason that in the railways
we have the chief security for development loans, and
the most productive of all the State assets. In few
countries in the world is the expenditure on construction
and maintenance so small, so that under
present conditions they yield a handsome return on
capital outlay. The Netherlands and the Pretoria-Pietersburg
railways have been acquired from their
former owners, and the incomplete Selati and
Machadodorp-Ermelo lines will shortly follow. If we
take the price paid, with the addition in the latter
case of the outlay necessary for completion, as the
capital value, we shall find that the net receipts, even
after the large reductions in rates which have been
made and must be maintained, show a generous percentage
of profit.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a
href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It will be explained later what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
part this important asset is called upon to play in
the finance of the new colonies. So much for the
main lines; but a system of light railways, constructed
at small expense, is vital to the mineral and
agricultural exploitation of such districts as Bethel,
Lichtenburg, Wolmaranstad, and Waterberg, in the
Transvaal and the southern part of the Orange River
Colony. In a flat upland country, where animal
transport for some years to come will be precarious
and expensive, where the roads are still unsuitable
for steam haulage, and where coal is cheap, perfect
conditions exist for an extensive light-railway development.</p>

<p>Railway extension, then, is one of the first demands
of the country: it is comparatively easy to achieve,
and most of the necessary capital has already been
found for it. But the omnipresent labour difficulty
appears here as elsewhere, not indeed with the magnitude
of the mining problem, but with an equal insistence.
To carry out the programme sketched
above in any reasonable time, say three years, some
40,000 natives will be required. At the present
moment the number employed is scarcely 5000, and
10,000 is the limit which the railways may recruit
in South Africa by an agreement with the Chamber
of Mines. Many natives, such as the Basutos, will
work on railways when they will not go underground;
and the agreed limit is fair enough to
both parties. But the balance cannot be secured
without seriously trespassing upon the supply grounds
of the mines. The Uganda railway was built with
imported labour, and it seems inevitable that the
Central South African railways must follow suit.
The limited funds at their disposal, and the difficulties
in the way of the country&rsquo;s absorbing at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the moment large numbers of unskilled workmen,
make the employment of white navvies alone impossible.
The railways, indeed, furnish a fine experimenting-ground
for the importation of indentured
foreign labour under a short-time contract and a
condition of repatriation. The number they require
is small: 10,000 will tide them over all immediate
needs; the nature of the work enables a complete
supervision to be exercised; and while it is still
doubtful whether alien labour can be secured for the
mines, experience has shown that for surface railway
work the supply is certain. In the congested districts
of India and China the small cultivator, to whom land
is the object of his life, will gladly leave his home for
one or two years if he can return with the money to
buy a plot of ground; and when the return home is
the cause of the setting out there will be no trouble
in repatriation.</p>

<p class="smlpadt">The premier market, now and for many years, must
be the Rand. Its great industrial population and the
higher scale of living make it the natural market for
all native agricultural and pastoral products. So
much so that the farmers in the eastern province
of Cape Colony, in spite of heavy railway rates, found
it profitable to send the bulk of their produce thither.
This is at once the advantage and misfortune of the
country: advantage, in having an accessible market
which it will take years to glut; misfortune, in that
the merits of the market to the country producer
mean costly living to the industrial inhabitants. The
difficulty will no doubt adjust itself; for if, as all
believe, the new colonies take many steps towards
feeding themselves, and in consequence the prices of
necessaries fall, new and nearer markets will arise in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
different parts of the country, and a genuinely self-supporting
provincial society will be organised. New
mining centres in the north and east, possibly, too, in
the west, may bring new townships into being; old
and semi-decayed dorps will revive; and that novelty
in the new colonies, towns like Brighton or Cheltenham,
which exist purely for residence, may yet be
found at Warm Baths for winter, or on the shores of
Lake Chrissie for the summer heats. The Rand,
again, will be the chief market for the subsidiary
industries which must arise,&mdash;for coal and iron, for
manufactured articles and dressed produce. It is too
early in the day to talk in any serious sense of exports.
The Transvaal, at any rate, will be for long a
consumer rather than a producer among the nations
of the world.</p>

<p>The tremendous cost of living is the subject of the
chief complaints among new-comers to South Africa.
Before the discovery of gold the Transvaal was a cheap
country to dwell in. A bullock which now costs #20
could be bought for #5; and a native, who now draws
#3 or #4 per month in wages, was then very well
content with 5s. Now there is hardly anything which
is not scarcer and dearer in South Africa than in almost
any other part of the globe. The causes of this high
cost are partly natural and partly artificial; but all, I
think, are terminable. The demands of the gold industry,
the long distance from ports, the sparse rural
population, are obvious natural causes, all of which
tend to modification and mutual adjustment. The
artificial causes are three: the cost of ocean freightage,
the high railway rates, and the monopoly in the hands
of a small mercantile class. The first can never be
reduced below a fairly high figure, and in the loud
complaint of &ldquo;shipping rings,&rdquo; which is in the mouth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
of most traders, there is a little unfairness. It is too
often the cloak which they use to cover their own
extortions. But reductions will certainly be made,
and in any case the chief force of the grievance, so far
as necessaries are concerned, will decline with the
growth of local production. Railway rates have already
suffered a substantial decrease, and will be
further reduced down to a certain point, which for
the present is determined by the fiscal needs of the
country. For railway rates are a form of taxation:
the railways are the chief revenue producer, and to
lower the rates too far would be merely robbing Peter
to pay Paul&mdash;a form of relief which would need to
be balanced by some new form of taxation. The chief
efficient cause of the expense of living is undoubtedly
the exorbitant monopoly of local merchants. It is no
exaggeration to say that anything sold at 100 per cent
profit is to the ordinary trader a form of charity:
legitimate business begins for him at 120, or thereabouts.
No class is so clamorous about its interests,
so ready to identify its profits with national wellbeing,
and claim a monopoly of the purer civic emotions.
But no part of the economic situation is so radically
unsound. The Polish Jew and the coolie make a profitable
living throughout the country, not because the
white population have no prejudice against them, but
because they are driven to their stores by the comparative
reasonableness of their prices. This cause, as
I have said, is artificial and terminable. The influx
of a large population will increase the area of competition,
and reduce profits to a normal basis. And
this, again, depends on the prosperity of the mines;
so that we are brought round to the starting-point of
all South African economics. Once this result were
achieved its benefits would react on the mines, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
with the decrease of the cost of living wages would go
down, and what is at present an ideal&mdash;an increase in
the area over which white labour can be employed&mdash;would
come within the sphere of practical politics.</p>

<p>The economic situation of the two colonies is therefore
composed of a number of perplexing oppositions.
The one certain fact is the great hidden wealth. But
to make those riches actual there must be labour,
and, over and above any question of imported and
indentured workmen, to secure labour there must
be reasonable cheapness in the necessaries of life and
work. Customs tariffs, railway rates, general taxation,
must all be calculated on a modest scale. But,
on the other hand, if the country is to advance to
that civilisation which is its due, money must be
spent freely by the State on productive and unproductive
enterprises; and in addition to such services,
which are the basis of the Guaranteed Loan, there is
the War Debt, 30 millions of dead-weight round the
neck of a struggling people. To pay the interest
on debts and to provide money for day-to-day needs
there must be revenue, and so there comes a point
where direct and indirect charges, whatever the
demands of the situation, simply cannot be reduced
further if the mechanism of Government is to continue
in action. Heroic persons advocate heroic
remedies, such as the cessation of all enterprise in
favour of mining progress, or the renunciation of certain
charges in favour of cheap living. In one sense
all politics are a gamble; but there are limits beyond
which statesmanship cannot go in the way of staking
everything on a chance, and yet hope to justify itself
in the eyes of the world in the event of failure. The
real problem for the statesman is not how to plunge
wildly&mdash;it requires little skill to do that&mdash;but how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
to adjust with nice discrimination. To preserve an
adequate revenue, while at the same time giving
ample play to the forces of production, is, in a word,
the only policy which contains the rudiments of ultimate
success.</p>

The following are some of the working costs of the mines. Low

Main Reef, 17s. 4d.; Meyer and Charlton, 18s. 2d.; Simmer and Jack,

Robinson Deep, 30s. 2d. The Robinson-Randfontein group have ore of
a gold value of 34s. 9d. per ton, and a profit of 2s. over the working
cost. The Bonanza has ore worth #5 a-ton.</p>

Imported labour reduces itself in practice to Chinese or Japanese.
Even supposing that the Indian Government consented to the strict form
of indenture necessary for mining purposes, the political danger of introducing
coolie labour into a country which already contains a considerable
coolie population would be very great.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a

An argument often used in this connection is that the employment of
Asiatic labourers, repatriated at the end of their contract, would mean
that a very large sum of money annually left the country. But the
same thing will happen if native African labour is brought from Central
or Western Africa or Somaliland. It is happening at present with the
natives from Portuguese territory, who form 90 per cent of the existing
labour-supply.</p>

I have said elsewhere that there are few South African problems
which are not long-descended. The first proposal to introduce Chinese
labour was made by Jan van Riebeck, the first Governor of Cape Colony,
about the year 1653. He urged the scheme with great persistence, but
home opinion proved too strong for him.</p>

The cost of the acquisition of the present railway systems was
roughly 14 millions. This does not, of course, represent an accurate
statement of capital outlay, as in the Orange Free State considerable
sums were spent out of State revenue. But even if we put the figure at
the outside limit of 20 millions, the net profits are still more than 10
per cent of the capital value.</p>

<h5>II.</h5>

<p>The foregoing is a rough survey of the assets with
which the new colonies start on their career. As
in all beginnings, a multitude of questions protrude
themselves. Every politician has his own nostrum,
every interest its own pressing demands. But the
main questions are simple, at least in their outlines,
and it is permissible to disentangle from the web the
chief threads of economic policy. Three postulates
there must be before a solvent and progressive nation
can be founded. In the first place, life must be made
possible,&mdash;life on the various scales which a civilised
society demands. In the second place, industries&mdash;the
gold industry and the host of subsidiaries which
must follow&mdash;should be given free scope for development
by enlightened legislation, and the removal of
burdens from the raw material of progress. Finally,
a sufficient revenue must be secured to meet the vast
reproductive expenditure which the country demands.
To reconcile these three needs, which in practice
often appear contradictory, is the task of the new
Government.</p>

<p>Taking the three axioms as our guide, we have to
consider the two questions in all administration&mdash;the
raising of revenue and the apportionment of expenditure.
Our inquiry into revenue must be chiefly
concerned with the Transvaal. The Orange River
Colony is for the present prosperous, and its future
solvency seems assured. With a certain income of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
half a million, and an expenditure of a little less, its
fiscal problem is simplicity itself. But the Transvaal
presents the case of a country with great potential
wealth, which must borrow heavily to elicit its prosperity.
Certain revenue-producing charges must be
cut down to make life on a proper scale possible, but
revenue must also be raised to make this life possible.
It is the old story of Egypt&mdash;taking out of one pocket
to put into the other, with somewhere behind the
transaction an economic Providence to enhance values
in the exchange. Such a policy is based upon a faith
in the land, which by its productive power provides
a natural sinking fund to wipe off encumbrances.
Loans can be raised at 4 per cent, because the country
repays a hundredfold.</p>

<p>The main items, exclusive of railways, which in the
financial year 1902-3 made up the revenue of the
Transvaal, were customs revenue at upwards of two
millions, mining revenue at half a million, stamp and
transfer duties at #720,000, taxes on trades and professions
and post and telegraphs at a quarter of a
million each, and native revenue at a little over
#300,000. The total revenue was about #4,700,000.
The estimated revenue for 1903-4 has been put at
#4,500,000, made up of customs at #1,800,000,
mining revenue at #750,000, post and telegraphs at
#360,000, taxes on trades and professions at #200,000,
native revenue at #500,000, stamp and transfer duties
at #700,000, and #200,000 for miscellaneous items.
Since the object of the present inquiry is to estimate
the financial position of the country, it is necessary in
the first place to take the various sources of revenue
one by one, and estimate their value and their defects.
Several may at once be omitted. Post and telegraphs
barely pay for their working expenses, and cannot be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
counted upon as a source of revenue. Stamp and
transfer duties, stand licences and rent, and the bulk
of the miscellaneous items, are for the present static
figures, or vary within narrow limits, and it is improbable
that they will be altered so as to greatly
increase their present revenue during the next few
years. Revenue questions for the Transvaal are concerned
with two items which far excel all others in
importance&mdash;mining revenue and customs. There is
a third, and the largest of the three, railway profits;
but, as will be explained later, this item has been
excluded from the separate budgets of the two
colonies.</p>

<p>The old mining revenue was mainly indirect. A tax
on profits was indeed imposed by the late Government
in February 1899, but war broke out before there was
time to organise its collection. The real burden lay in
the dynamite monopoly, which at its worst increased
the price of explosives by #2 the case, and at its best
by about 30s. The mines required an annual supply
of 300,000 cases, which meant an annual charge,
beyond the cost of material, of #450,000. The
average net profits on the annual production of gold
may be put at #6,000,000, which, with a 5 per cent
profit tax, would return #300,000 a-year. Had the
Boer <i>rigime</i> continued, the mining industry would
have contributed in the form of imposts something
between #600,000 and #750,000 per annum (for a
reduction of 10s. in the dynamite charge had been
promised on the eve of the war). From the standpoint
of the mines the whole sum was an impost, but
only the yield from the profit tax would have found its
way into the Exchequer.</p>

<p>The present charges on the mining industry consist
of the prospectors&rsquo; and diggers&rsquo; licences, the 10 per
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
cent tax on profits, imposed by Proclamation No. 34
of 1902, and the cost of native passes, which was
formerly paid by the native himself, but is now
borne by the employer. The mining industry will
therefore on its present basis pay from half a million
upwards in profit tax, about #120,000 for native
passes, and about #50,000 in licences. It is difficult
to see how this taxation could be fairly increased.
To add, for example, a charge of 20s. per case to
explosives would be to tax the means of production,&mdash;a
fatal heresy,&mdash;to keep some of the smaller
mines out of the profit-making class, and in the long-run
to harm the Exchequer itself. The true policy
is not to hamper the earning of profits by excessive
charges, but to enlarge by judicious encouragement
the area over which profits are made. It is of
the first importance that European capital should be
attracted to, and not scared away from, the country.
Under the present system the Government receipts
will advance <i>pari passu</i> with any increase in the
prosperity of the mines, and to secure the ultimate
gain one may well be satisfied to forego a larger
immediate return.</p>

<p>There is a fourth source of revenue from mining
enterprise which may be roughly described as windfalls.
The Government has a moral right, which no one
denies, to profit by new discoveries, and in any case,
as a large landowner, it will be interested as an immediate
participant. The provisions of the old Gold
Law have been so often discussed in print that it is
sufficient here to give the briefest sketch of them.
Legislation by the late Government on precious
minerals began as early as 1858, and continued in a
long series of resolutions and counter-resolutions till
the somewhat confused position of affairs was simplified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
and regulated by the famous law, No. 15 of 1898.
The basis of this law is to be found in the principle
that to the owner belonged the ownership of minerals
found under his land, but to the State the right of
regulating their disposal. It attempted to give to
both owner and State a fair share of the proceeds,
while at the same time the prospector and discoverer
received a moderate reward for their enterprise.
There can be no question about the validity of the
three rights; the only dispute is concerned with their
relative proportions. Besides the matter of share,
there is one other question of great importance&mdash;how
far it is permissible for an owner to refuse to allow
the exploital of minerals under his land.</p>

<p>I take the last question first. Under the old law
the owner of private property could prospect without
a licence on his own land, and could give authority to
any licensed person. If minerals were found, the State
President, subject to certain compensation, could throw
open the land as a public diggings. State land could
be prospected and proclaimed in exactly the same way.
But if the owner of private land refused to prospect
himself or allow others to prospect, the State could not
interfere to compel the exploital of his minerals. Much
has been said of the right of the public in the shape of
the prospector to go anywhere in his search; but no
such <em>right</em> has ever existed or can exist. The whole
question is one of policy. It is clearly not the interest
of the State to leave the chief source of its wealth unworked;
nor in any real sense is it the interest of the
private owner. But it would be an intolerable burden
to a farmer to be subjected to constant trespass by
any prospector who cared to take out a licence. We
must, however, clearly distinguish between Crown and
private land, so far as the steps towards the discovery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
of the minerals are concerned. Crown land, under
strict conditions, should be free to any licensed prospector;
but, as the settlement of Crown land by
agricultural tenants is a vital part of Government
policy, provision must be made for ample compensation
to such a tenant for disturbance caused by prospecting.
Such provision should refer not only to unproclaimed
or hereafter to be proclaimed Crown land, but should
be brought to cover areas such as Barberton, Lydenberg,
and the Wood Bush, which have been long
working gold-fields. If compensation and security is
not provided, some of the most valuable agricultural
and pastoral lands in the country will be incapable of
white settlement, and their only occupants will be the
Kaffir, the coolie, and the bywoner, who have no
interest in creating permanent homes. It is undesirable
to tie up minerals, but it is equally undesirable
to tie up agricultural wealth. People have talked of
proclamation as if it were an inviolable contract between
the Crown and the public, to which no new
conditions could be added. There is neither legal nor
historical justification for this view. It is right for
the Crown, having given permission to the public to
go upon its lands for a particular purpose, to impose
from time to time conditions under which the permission
may be exercised. On private lands the case
is different. No owner of a private farm who is in
beneficial occupation of it (when he is not, the land
should be treated for this purpose as Crown land)
should be compelled to allow prospecting unless he
has already himself prospected or given authority to
others. To enact otherwise would be to make a freehold
title little more than a farce. But in order to
prevent a reactionary or indolent owner from tying up
valuable minerals for an indefinite time, when there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
are reasonable grounds for believing that such minerals
exist, the Commissioner of Mines should have the
power to give notice to the owner that he must
prospect or allow others to do so, and, if he still refuses,
to issue to the public a small number of prospecting
licences on the property. When prospecting has taken
place, and, after an investigation by the Government,
minerals are found to exist in payable quantities, the
area, subject to all rights of compensation, should be
proclaimed a public digging.</p>

<p>Under the old law the discoverer, if his discovery
were made at least six miles distant from a locality
already worked, was entitled to mark off six claims
which he could work without payment of licence-moneys.
He had also the ordinary public right of
pegging off not more than fifty claims in the proclaimed
area, and fifty additional claims on payment
of reduced licences. The only real reward to the prospector
for his trouble and expense was the six free
claims&mdash;hardly a sufficient inducement to undertake
laborious, and often costly, enterprises. The Gold
Law Commission recommended that the discoverer
should receive one-thirtieth of the proclaimed area,
provided that in no case such one-thirtieth exceeded
thirty claims. This seems a reasonable but not extravagant
honorarium to the pioneer. He would be entitled
to the first selection, and would hold his claims
free of licence-moneys till they reached the producing
stage.</p>

<p>The owner, under the old law, was entitled to
reserve a <i>mynpacht</i>, equal to one-tenth of the proclaimed
area, for which he paid either 10s. per morgen
per annum or 2&frac12; per cent of his gross profits. He
was also entitled to mark off a <i>werf</i> or homestead
area, on which prospecting was forbidden; and on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
this, too, he could claim a <i>mynpacht</i> from the State.
He was entitled to a certain number of owner&rsquo;s claims,
which could not exceed ten. He was entitled, before
proclamation, to grant to other persons a certain
number of claims called <i>vergunnings</i>. Finally, he
was entitled to share equally with the Government in
all licence-moneys on claims, and to receive a share,
varying from one-half to three-fourths, of all licence-moneys
on stands. This system gave the owner
about one-sixth of the whole proclaimed area,&mdash;an
extravagant share, and one complicated by the curious
rights into which it was divided. Such unmeaning
complexity must be abolished, and one form of title
&mdash;claim licences&mdash;substituted. <i>Werf</i> and <i>vergunning</i>
claims should be done away with, and the
owner, as the Commission recommended, be allowed
to peg out one-seventh of the proclaimed area, which
should take the place of <i>werf</i>, <i>mynpacht</i>, <i>vergunnings</i>,
and owner&rsquo;s claims. The Commission has also recommended
that, while the owner should retain half of
the proceeds of licences, the Crown should have the
right, without consulting him, to remit or reduce the
licence-moneys in what appear to be deserving cases.</p>

<p>The State, under the old law, received all licence-moneys
on claims and stands situated on State lands,
and half the licence-moneys from claims and stands
on private lands. It received also certain payments
from the owners of <i>mynpachts</i>. This in itself should
provide for a considerable revenue. But in addition
the Crown should have the right of sale of claims
in proved districts, where the ground has a certain
value. The former method, in places where pegging
was out of the question, such as along the Main Reef,
was to hold a claims&rsquo; lottery, a method which was
neither rational nor lucrative. The sale by auction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
of claims in proved districts would bring in a large
additional revenue and do no injustice to the prospector.
But in all places yet unproved the public
should be free to peg out claims and try their
fortune. It is important, also, to revise the present
system of licence-moneys, so as to make the licences
small during the prospecting and non-producing
period, and raise them when mining actually begins.
Under the old law all licences were #1 per claim
per month, a payment which bore heavily upon the
poor prospector who was still labouring to prove his
claim. Prospectors&rsquo; licences were issued at 5s. per
month on private land and 2s. 6d. on Government
land. The Commission recommended the abolition
of prospectors&rsquo; licences, and the substitution of one
general licence to search for minerals, on which a
stamp duty of 2s. 6d. per month should be charged.
When minerals are found and a public digging has
been proclaimed, licence-moneys of 2s. 6d. per claim
per month should be paid on Government land, and
5s. on private land till the producing stage is reached.
After that date the old licence of #1 would come
into force.</p>

<p>The Transvaal Legislature will shortly be called
upon to consider a new Gold Law based on the report
of the Commission, of which I have sketched the
chief features. Of almost equal importance, in the
light of recent discoveries, is the new Diamond Law,
where substantially the same questions of principle
are involved. Owner, discoverer, and State should
have a fair share of profit&mdash;but especially the State.
We are none too well off in the ordinary course
of things to be able to afford to neglect our windfalls.
A serious and permanent increase of revenue
can come only from a gradual increase of producing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
activity; but, apart from permanent needs, many
occasions will arise for capital expenditure in reproductive
works which are vital to progress. A
windfall is a development loan without guarantee
or interest or sinking fund to burden the mind of
the Exchequer.</p>

<p class="smlpadt">The other direct taxes are so few and unimportant
that they may safely be neglected. But it is necessary
to face the question of adjustment and new
taxation, for the time may come when it may be
expedient to lower many of the existing duties and
to revise thoroughly railway rates, and it is desirable
to have alternative proposals to meet the decline of
revenue which will follow. It may be desirable, for
instance, to abolish wholly the present charge on
dynamite, as it most certainly will be necessary to
lower still further the cost of transit on the railways.
But new taxation must be imposed with the greatest
caution. The present population of the Transvaal
pays in indirect taxes #10 a-head as against #2 at
home; the field for direct taxation is therefore strictly
circumscribed. To certain taxes the road is barred.
A land tax, however light, would bear heavily upon
the impoverished rural districts, and in any case is
impossible under the Terms of Surrender. An income
tax would make life unbearable if the limit of exemption
were low, and if the limit were high the yield
would be inconsiderable. A general profit tax on the
earnings of both companies and individuals may become
feasible in time, but we must first await the
return of normal conditions of life. One way may be
found in increased native taxation, a matter which,
as it is bound up with other questions of native policy,
is discussed in another chapter. But the object of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
all new taxation must be to strike at the untaxed
and unproductive elements in society, for reasons
quite as much political as economic. On this ground
two taxes seem just and desirable, though there are
certain obvious difficulties to be surmounted before
they can be levied. The first is a tax upon unoccupied
lands, a quite possible and equitable tax which
would meet with little real opposition. Land companies
in the Transvaal alone possess some 12 million
acres, the bulk of which has been bought for supposed
mineral values. Not 10 per cent of the land is
occupied, and nearly 50 per cent is capable of occupation
of some kind. Quite apart from revenue considerations,
a tax which would compel settlement, or,
failing that, would drive some of the more obstinate
companies to put good land in the market, would be
sound policy. What applies to the companies would
apply to the private landowner who has his half-dozen
farms, and lives in a corner of one of them.
<i>Latifundia</i> bid fair to be among the curses of the
land, unless proper measures are taken to check them
in time; and if this is done, the land troubles of the
Australian colonies and their confiscatory legislation
will be saved to South Africa. The machinery would
be simple. A permanent commission would have to
be established (the judicial committee of the Central
Land Board, provided for in the Settler&rsquo;s Ordinance,
could do the work). Each owner of unoccupied land
would be summoned before it to state his case. He
might show that three-fourths of his land was at the
moment incapable of occupation, in which case he
would only be assessed on the remainder. The tax
might be an <i>ad valorem</i> tax of 2 or 3 per cent. A
day might be fixed, say eighteen months from assessment,
when the tax would come into operation. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
case owners proved refractory and preferred to pay
the tax, it might be increased on a sliding scale till
settlement became compulsory. There would be no
hardship to company or individual, since only land
for which a white occupier could be found would be
assessable for the purpose. The second tax is of equal
importance but far greater complexity. The most difficult
person to reach in taxation is the holder for the
rise, the speculator who is nothing else, the great
class which toils and spins not and grows fat on the
energy of others. The basis of his activity is the
quotation of shares, and a tax to affect him must be
in relation to such market values. You cannot introduce
a too cumbrous machinery without acting in
restraint of legitimate trade, quite apart from the
fact that most of the business is done with bearer
shares which pass through fifty hands before registration.
But it might be possible&mdash;it is a problem
for a revenue expert to decide&mdash;to affect this class
indirectly and curtail its activity by a tax on the
profits of companies based on the average quotation
for the preceding year. At the best it would be only
a half measure, for it would be limited to dividend-paying
companies, and the energies of the middleman
are chiefly exercised on companies whose profits are
still wholly speculative. But with all deductions
there seems to be a chance of revenue in such a tax,
and a certain general economic value. The tax, again,
would be limited to new issues, for in the case of old
issues, even when the shares stand at 1000 per cent
premium, a high dividend may represent a very
moderate dividend on the capital of the investor who
bought in when shares were high. If the dividend of
a new issue justified a high quotation, the quotation
would be high in spite of the tax, but the existence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
of the tax would tend to keep down the speculative
quotation to some reasonable relation to former dividends.
If dividends declined, and the quotation fell,
the tax would go automatically out of existence. Such
a tax, if possible, would not yield in normal years a
great revenue, but it would have certain salutary and
permanent effects. It would touch companies only in
a high state of prosperity. It would indirectly touch
the man who buys not for dividends but to realise
by taking away in some part the basis of his speculations.
It would exercise a steadying influence upon
the market, and prevent, at least in one class of
security, fictitious rises. But as a means of revenue
its position would be really that of a windfall, for it
would enable the Crown to profit largely out of any
period of great financial excitement. A boom, so
eagerly desired by all but in many of its results so
maleficent, might be delayed by its agency; and if it
came, as no doubt it would in spite of any ingenious
taxation, and share values became blindly inflated
irrespective of past or present dividends, the Government
would perform that rarest of feats, and derive
an honest profit from the vices of the multitude.</p>

<p class="smlpadt">The Transvaal, till the other day, was the only
important South African state not included in the
Customs Union. Its customs law was No. 4 of 1894,
amended by Ordinance 22 of 1902. The basis was an
<i>ad valorem</i> tax of 7&frac12; per cent on all goods brought
across the border, with an addition of 20 per cent to
the valuation price for the purpose of the tax in the
case of goods directly imported from over-sea. The
purpose of this provision is obvious, since to goods
bought at the coast the cost of over-sea freightage and
handling is added in reaching the price on which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
tax is assessed. But to this general duty there were
two important exceptions. There was a lengthy free
list, which included, in addition to goods imported for
Government use, all live stock, books, tree, flower,
and vegetable seeds and plants, tools and effects of
immigrant mechanics, fencing material, mining and
agricultural machinery, cement, and unmanufactured
woods. There was also a list on which, in addition to
the general 7&frac12; per cent, special duties were charged.
Beer paid 3s. per gallon, dynamite 9d. per pound,
gunpowder 6d. per pound, spirits from 14s. to #1 per
imperial gallon, manufactured tobacco 3s. per pound,
leaf-tobacco 2s. per pound (when brought from over-sea),
wine from 4s. to 12s. 6d. per gallon. The tariff
was therefore moderately protectionist. Most articles
necessary for the great industries were free; articles
of common use were subject only to the <i>ad valorem</i>
duty; while articles of luxury, and especially all
fermented liquors, were subject to a fair but not
excessive special tax.</p>

<p>The difficulty was that the tariff was not a fair
guide to the real taxation of imports. The Transvaal
has no seacoast; all her imports have to be landed
at the ports of other colonies or states, and carried
to her borders by alien railways. Moreover, all
the seaboard colonies, as well as the Orange River
Colony, were banded together in a Customs Union,
from which she was excluded. A tariff hostility
was therefore smouldering on, which gave acute
annoyance to the Transvaal importer. I will take
two instances of purely predatory imposts. The coast
colonies levied a so-called transit due of 3 per cent on
dutiable articles for the Transvaal, a due which was
the same in principle as the levies which the barons
of the Rhine used to make from the harmless merchants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
passing through their borders. Again, in the
case of the Orange River Colony, the only inland
colony in the old Customs Union, the duties were
collected at the coast ports, and a collecting charge
was made, which was simply another form of the
transit due. At one time the charge was as high
as 25 per cent of the duties collected; but on the
petition of the Orange River Colony it was afterwards
reduced to 15 per cent. How far such a rate was
from representing the real cost of collection is shown
by the fact that the Transvaal duties were collected
by the coast colonies from the occupation of Pretoria
to the end of 1901 at a charge of only 2&frac12; per cent.</p>

<p>The Transvaal had thus a tariff in itself reasonable,
but she was embarrassed by her isolation. It was
obviously desirable that she should enter into the
Customs Union, which would then comprise the whole
of South Africa, for if federation is ever to become
a serious policy it is well to begin by throwing down
economic barriers. But economics have an awkward
way of overriding all other considerations, and the
entrance of the Transvaal into the Union could only
be a matter of hard business&mdash;give and take on both
sides. The interest of the two parties was on this
matter far apart. The coast colonies are agricultural
and pastoral, and their ports are forwarding depots.
They are frankly protectionist, and their customs have
always been their chief source of revenue. The Transvaal
is industrial, and for the present a free-trader;
she must have cheap food, cheap raw material, cheap
necessaries. While at the moment customs form the
largest item in her revenue, it does not overshadow
all others, and in time it is probable that it will sink
to a second place. The question was, therefore, What
of her present tariff would the Transvaal relinquish to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
meet the wishes of the Union, and what compensating
advantages could she expect from her membership?</p>

<p>The Bloemfontein Conference of March 1903 prepared
a Customs Convention, which has since been
ratified by the several states, and the old Customs
Union has been amended and extended to include the
whole of British South Africa. How far has this act
improved the economic position of the Transvaal? In
the first place, there is one solid gain, the abolition of
the transit dues, estimated at between #250,000 and
#300,000 per annum. There is, too, a gain in the
mere fact of union, and the freedom which it gives
from the incessant bickerings of conflicting tariffs.
Since her duties are collected by the coast colonies at
the moderate charge of 5 per cent, a saving may also
be effected by the reduction of the customs establishment
on her borders. The benefit which she has conferred
in return is the opening of her markets without
restraint to the products of British South Africa, an
opening which should amply repay the coast colonies
for the reduction in the protective tariff from over-sea.
The actual tariff charges are in the nature of
an elaborate compromise. To take first the case of
the simple food-stuffs. In 1898, under the old
Transvaal tariff, imported flour paid in duty #26,955,
and imported mealies #16,290. Under the old Union
tariff they would have paid respectively #114,068 and
#69,332&mdash;a difference of over 400 per cent. The old
Union rate was 2s. per 100 lb. for grain and 4s. 6d.
per 100 lb. for flour, while the old Transvaal rate was
an <i>ad valorem</i> duty of about 9 per cent. It was
impossible that either party could accept the other&rsquo;s
rate, so the present solution of 1s. for grain and 2s.
for flour may be taken as a satisfactory compromise,
which an industrial country could support. It must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
be further remembered that all food-stuffs produced
elsewhere in South Africa enter free, and that the
cost of bread under the new system will be if anything
reduced. Article XV. of the Convention gives
the Transvaal a further power in times of scarcity to
suspend the duty on food-stuffs altogether, and give
a bonus to imports of the same class produced in the
neighbouring colonies. The ordinary manufactured
article, which in a non-manufacturing country plays
as large a part in the cost of living as bread, is also
reduced for the purchaser. It pays an <i>ad valorem</i>
duty of 10 per cent, which at first sight seems higher
than the old rate of 7&frac12;, which with other charges
worked out in practice at about 9. But 2&frac12; per cent
must be deducted on account of the 25 per cent preferential
rate for British goods, and with the abolition
of the transit dues the actual duty will work out at
between 7 and 8 per cent. Raw material and the
necessaries of industry remain much where they were
under the old tariff, which was highly favourable to
them; but the charge on dynamite has been reduced
from 9d. a-pound to 1&frac12;d., which is a reduction of over
30s. on the 50-lb. case.</p>

<p>A mere comparison of tariffs does not show the real
cheapening of the necessaries of life; for to get at the
practical effect, the abolition of the transit dues, the
reduction of railway rates, amounting to at least
#300,000 per annum, and the preference rate on
British goods, must all be considered. Under the old
tariff and railway rates every 100 lb. of flour from
Port Elizabeth to the Transvaal paid 9d. to the
Transvaal in duty. The freight was 6s. 2d., so that
it paid altogether in charges 6s. 11d. Under the
Convention the same quantity of flour will pay 2s.
in duty and 3s. 9d. in railway rates, so that, in spite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
of the higher duty, the charge is only 5s. 9d.,&mdash;a
saving to the Transvaal consumer of 1s. 2d., and a
gain to the Transvaal treasury of 1s. 3d. There
are many instances of a similar kind. Ordinary
groceries will be reduced by about 3 per cent, paraffin
by 1s. 6d. a case, grease by 2s. 6d. per 100 lb., cement
by 2s. 9d. a cask. Tea and coffee, on the other hand,
show a slight increase. In one branch there is a very
marked increase, and an exception to the inter-colonial
free trade, which is the basis of the Convention.
Each party to the Union is entitled to levy on the
importation of spirits distilled in and from the produce
of places within the Union a duty equal to any
excise duty which it may levy on spirits made within
its own borders. In the Transvaal there is no excise,
for the manufacture of spirits is wholly forbidden. It
is of the most urgent importance to keep fermented
liquors out of reach of the native population, and to
suppress all illicit traffic. The importation of Portuguese
spirits has been stopped by treaty, and it was
clearly impossible for the Transvaal to consent to the
importation of spirits on easier terms from the other
British colonies. The concluding paragraph of Article
XVII., therefore, provides that &ldquo;where a prohibition
exists in any colony or territory of the Union against
the manufacture of spirits for sale, it shall be lawful
for such colony or territory to levy on spirits produced
within the Union a custom duty not exceeding that
levied on similar spirits produced outside the Union.&rdquo;
The duty in force is therefore from 15s. to #1 per
imperial gallon in addition to the 10 per cent <i>ad
valorem</i> rate; which, it has been calculated, is an
increase on the former cost of from 4s. to 6s. per
case.</p>

<p>The new Union is therefore almost wholly in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
favour of the new colonies. The cost to the consumer
is lessened, but the revenue does not lose appreciably,
since charges, formerly diverted by the coast colonies,
now go to its coffers. The coast colonies, in an admirable
spirit of statesmanship, have consented to surrender
a part of their revenue in order that the chief
industrial market of South Africa might be open to
their people&mdash;an example of that policy of foregoing
certain revenues on a narrow basis for the sake of
a possible revenue in a wider field which is of the
essence of good government. The preference given
to British goods, while still further reducing rates
in favour of a large class of imports, is also a step
towards federation, which does not, as such experiments
are apt to do, militate in any serious way
against local commerce. The one person who might
complain is the farmer of the Transvaal, who sees
his markets thrown open to the old grain-lands of
Cape Colony; but if the long railway journey which
his rivals have to face is not a sufficient handicap
to enable him to hold his own, then we need not
lament his fall. Vital as agricultural progress is, it
cannot hope for protection at the expense of industrial
prosperity.</p>

<p class="smlpadt">The normal expenditure of the Transvaal may be
taken roughly at #3,600,000. This figure is exclusive
of debt charges, or any capital outlay on development
which may be met out of revenue. It represents
merely the day-to-day cost of the administrative
machine. As revenue is enlarged the expenditure
will follow suit; but it is unlikely that the proportion
of costs to receipts, which is roughly three to four, will
ever increase. On the contrary, it might be considerably
reduced by a more complete administrative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
decentralisation. At present there are a number of
isolated departments&mdash;Native Affairs, Lands, Mines&mdash;with
local representatives wholly independent of each
other, and responsible only to the heads of their departments.
The resident magistrate, who is really an
administrative official, since the legal work is done by
the assistant magistrate, and who as a rule is not a
lawyer, has a very narrow control over a few subjects
like local government and public health. The system
is wasteful both of money and energy, for the isolated
departments often overlap unconsciously; and since
there is no local check, the tendency is for the head of
a department to increase his local staff and to vie with
other heads in securing large estimates. It also means
that a constant inspection has to be kept up from
headquarters, and each department supports a force of
travelling officials. The Indian precedent might be
followed with advantage, and real heads of districts
established, who would have a control, direct or indirect,
over all administrative work. They should be
responsible for the efficient and economic working of
their district, prepare their local estimates and reports,
and answer for their work only to the Governor and
Council. The great departments would exist as before,
but their local staffs would be much reduced in number,
so far as such staffs were administrative and not intrusted
with expert work. Experts, such as inspectors
of machinery, customs officers, and veterinary surgeons,
would remain directly responsible to their own departments,
though over these also the district administrator
would exercise a general supervision. In this way a
very considerable saving would be effected in salaries,
the unnecessarily large force of travelling inspectors
could be reduced, and the friction which inevitably
attends the working of isolated and independent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
officials in any district would be saved by the establishment
of responsible heads,&mdash;deputy administrators,
whose business it would be to supervise all district
Government work, and control all local expenditure.</p>


<h5>III.</h5>

<p>The natural assets of the country and the existing
fiscal system have been roughly sketched in the foregoing
pages. It remains to consider what burden these
two factors in collaboration are called upon to bear.
In view of the peculiar situation of the new colonies,
the necessity of a loan for development is sufficiently
obvious. The country was desolated by war. Large
sums were necessary for compensation to loyalists and
for the repatriation of the Dutch inhabitants. The
backward system of our predecessors had left public
works ill provided for in most places, particularly in
the country districts. If the wealth of the provinces,
mineral and agricultural, was to be exploited, and the
existing industries granted reasonable facilities for
progress, a heavy expenditure was imperative for
railway extension. If the rural parts were to be
developed and their population leavened with our
own countrymen, considerable sums must be expended
on settlement, and on such reproductive schemes as
forestry and irrigation. Finally, certain heavy liabilities
awaited the incoming Government. To buy
out the existing railways and repay certain military
debts and advances from the Imperial Treasury, fully
14 millions were required. The old debt of the Transvaal,
amounting to 2&frac12; millions, which carried 4 per
cent interest, must be paid off, and the capital required
for the repayment made part of a new loan at an
easier rate. The liabilities and needs of the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
stood therefore as follows: An advance by the Imperial
Government to cover the estimated Transvaal
deficit of 1901-2, #1,500,000; the old debt of the
Transvaal, #2,500,000; compensation to loyalists in
Cape Colony and Natal, #2,000,000; the acquisition
of the railways and the repayment of the
existing railway debt, #14,000,000; repatriation<a name="FNanchor_21_21"
id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
and compensation in the new colonies, #5,000,000;
railway extension, #5,000,000; land settlement,
#3,000,000; various public works, #2,000,000,&mdash;a
total of #35,000,000. This is the sum comprised in
the famous Guaranteed Loan.</p>

<p>But this figure, large as it is, does not exhaust our
burden. During the year 1901 and 1902 the question
of the contribution of the new colonies to the imperial
war debt was keenly discussed both in South Africa
and in England. Some fixed the payment likely to
be required at as much as #100,000,000; others argued
that the new colonies were likely to have so many
burdens of their own that they could not be called
upon to contribute at all. Moderate men on both
sides saw that some contribution was equitable, but
asked that it should not be fixed so high as to cripple
development. There were various proposals, such as
the ear-marking of certain sources of revenue and all
windfalls, or the allocating of a certain proportion of
any annual surplus; but such schemes were liable to
the objection from the side of the Imperial Government
that there was no certainty in the contribution,
and from the side of the new colonies that there was
no finality in the liability. The settlement which Mr
Chamberlain announced in his speech at Johannesburg
in January 1903 was, perhaps, the best possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
in the circumstances. The contribution was fixed at
#30,000,000, to be raised in three years by contributions
of #10,000,000 per annum. The first 10
millions at 4 per cent were underwritten without commission
by the great financial houses of the Rand, and
there is no reason to doubt that if they are called to
make good their guarantee, it will prove a profitable
investment. It is difficult to overestimate the merit
of an arrangement which tends to bind the great
houses to a closer interest in the general development
of the country. The War Loan was secured wholly
upon the Transvaal, but there is a contingent liability
on the Orange River Colony to pay a further sum of
#5,000,000 out of the Government share of any
discoveries of precious stones and metals.</p>

<p>We have, therefore, to face a total debt of
#65,000,000, of which 35 millions at 3 per cent are
a charge upon both colonies, and 30 millions at 4
per cent upon the Transvaal alone. It is a heavy
responsibility for a white population of a few
hundreds of thousands, face to face with a labour
problem. That the world at large believes in the
future of the country is shown by the way in
which the Guaranteed Loan was taken up, the first
30 millions having been subscribed more than thirty
times over. On this loan the interest charge, with
1 per cent sinking fund, will amount to an annual
payment of #1,400,000: in three years time the
War Loan, unless (which is probable) it can be issued
at a lower rate than 4 per cent, will mean an annual
charge of #1,200,000, with no sinking fund allowed.
We have therefore in front of us a possible annual
payment of #2,600,000, with a slight increase in the
future when a sinking fund is provided. The payment,
large in itself, was made more difficult by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
circumstances of the two colonies. The larger loan
is secured on both, but while the Orange River Colony
had a fair claim to a considerable part of the proceeds,
it was clearly impossible that she should pay a share
of the charge proportionate to her receipts. If she
shared in the loan only to the extent of the annual
contribution which on her small revenue she could
afford, many important public works both of land
settlement and railway extension would have to be
abandoned. Joined with this general administrative
difficulty, there was a departmental one connected
with the railways. The main line through the Orange
River Colony had acquired, as one of the main feeders
of the Transvaal, a purely fictitious value, and the
Orange River Colony profited greatly by the receipts.
But to have within one system two types of line,
one a through line simply, the other connected
directly with the great centres of production and
consumption, and to have those two types of lines
used as revenue-producing agents for two different
administrations, was to make a consistent railway
policy impossible. The country of the through line,
whose fictitious value produced a very real revenue,
would reclaim against reduction in rates for the
benefit of the other.</p>

<p>Both difficulties have been met by a very ingenious
scheme. The Inter-Colonial Council of the two
colonies, created by Order in Council of 20th May
1903, is significant in many ways, notably as the
first overt step towards federation; but for the
present we may look upon it purely as a financial
expedient. Two important departments, common to
both colonies, were placed wholly under the administration
of the Council&mdash;the Central South African
Railways and the South African Constabulary; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
a number of minor common services, such as surveys
and education, were added, and power was given to
the two legislatures to increase the number when
they saw fit. A Railway Committee of Council
forms the permanent controlling authority in all
railway matters. All net profits of the railways
in each year are assigned to Council to form its
revenues. Out of these it has to meet the expenditure
of the Constabulary and the minor common
charges, as well as the annual charge and management
costs of the Guaranteed Loan.<a name="FNanchor_22_22"
id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The financial duties of the Council are therefore
twofold. It has the entire administration of the
Loan in its hands, it provides for its apportionment
among the different services, and it undertakes the
payment of its charges. It has also to meet the
administrative expenditure of the common departments
intrusted to it, and for this purpose it receives
the net profits of the chief revenue-producing asset
of the two Governments. The first duty is comparatively
simple. A body composed of official and
unofficial representatives of the two parties to the
Loan can allocate speedily and equitably without the
constant strife and jealousy which would attend the
interference of two different publics. But the second
duty, which is concerned with the annual inter-colonial
budget, constitutes the index or barometer
of the new colony finances. The Budget for 1903-4
shows the following figures: on the revenue side,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
#2,350,000 from the net railway receipts; on the
expenditure side, #1,441,000 for the service of the
Guaranteed Loan,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a
href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> #1,520,000 for the
Constabulary,
and about #70,000 for minor common services. This
leaves a deficit of about #680,000, which, according to
the term of the Order in Council, will be met by contributions
from the Transvaal and the Orange River
Colony in proportion to their customs receipts&mdash;roughly,
#600,000 from the first, and #80,000 from the second.</p>

<p>Let us take the revenue side of the Budget first.
The position of the railways is anomalous. They are
virtually a taxing-machine, and in this respect the
most effective of Government properties. The normal
position of a Government railway should be that
of an institution worked for the public benefit, the
receipts being little in excess of the working costs
plus a moderate interest on the capital involved. In
this railway system the net profits, as we have seen,
are estimated for next year, allowing for the half-million
decrease from the reduction of rates, at
#2,300,000. No doubt it is economically unsound to
levy a tax of such magnitude on what is virtually a
necessity of life and a constituent of production. But
bad economics may be sound statesmanship, if they
are recognised as unsound&mdash;a temporary expedient
to obviate a more serious difficulty. Railway profits
are the buttress of inter-colonial finance: without
them there is no satisfactory provision for the debt
charges, and some form of direct taxation, which
would interfere far more effectively with nascent
industries, would be the only resort. The rates have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
been already reduced so as to provide, along with
the new customs tariff, for a very real decrease in
the cost of living. They will be still further reduced,
always keeping a limit in view which is calculated
on fiscal needs. To so adjust the rates that industrial
and rural development will not be hindered, and at
the same time to provide an adequate revenue,
presents a very pretty problem in railway finance.
It is the problem in the customs; it is the problem
in direct taxation; it is the essence of the economic
problem of the country. But with all reductions
there is a good chance of railway revenue increasing.
The 5 millions of the Loan which go to development
will in a year or two bear fruit. It is difficult to see
how the net profits can ever fall below #2,100,000,
while it is not unreasonable to hope that in a few
years they may rise to #2,500,000 or #3,000,000.</p>

<p>But while the revenue side is likely to increase,
the expenditure side of the Budget will inevitably
decline. When the full loan is raised the annual
charge will be #1,408,000, a stationary figure till
the loan is redeemed. The Council is a genuine
<i>Caisse de la Dette</i>; its revenues are charged in the
first instance with the loan charges, and the liability
of the separate colonies to make up any deficiency
distributes the weight of the debt equitably among
the parties to it. The danger of a <i>Caisse</i>, that it
tends to check general prosperity by a too arbitrary
appropriation of revenue, is avoided by the very
strict conditions of the Council&rsquo;s power and the nature
of its constitution. The minor common services will
not increase, and they may very probably decrease,
as such branches as surveys and permits shrink to
normal limits. The large item of 1&frac12; million for the
Constabulary will be lowered in future to about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
#1,200,000, which, on the present establishment, must
be regarded as a final figure. We may, therefore,
take #2,500,000 as the average expenditure in two
years&rsquo; time, which, if railway receipts increase to a
like figure in the same time, would make the Inter-Colonial
Budget balance.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Transvaal is able to pay any
contribution which may be required from her. But
in two years all or the greater part of the War
Loan will have been raised, and she may have to
face a maximum annual charge of #1,200,000, which
contains no provision for any sinking fund. In
these circumstances, on her present revenue she
could pay nothing towards any inter-colonial deficit:
she might even have to ask for a contribution.
There is every probability that such help could
be given, and an automatic system of adjustment
might be framed by which any inter-colonial
surplus could go to pay the charges or assist in the
creation of a sinking fund for the War Loan. This is
of course on the most unfavourable assumption,&mdash;that
the War Loan has to be raised at 4 per cent, that the
present industrial depression continues, and that the
Transvaal gets no increase of revenue from that prosperity
which she has a right to expect. It is far
more probable that the Council will be free to devote
any surplus it may show to the development of the
common services, for which the Loan provision cannot
in the long-run be found adequate.</p>

The Council is composed of the High Commissioner and Governor
(President), the two Lieutenant-Governors, the Commissioner of Railways,
the Inspector-General of the South African Constabulary, two
official members for each colony, nominated by the Lieutenant-Governors,
two unofficial members for each colony, elected by the
unofficial members of the two legislatures, and two members nominated

These figures require a word of explanation. Only 30 millions of the
loan have been issued, so the charge for interest and management should
only be #1,208,000; but as the loan year began in May and the financial
year for the budget began in July, interest and management charges for
fourteen months were included.</p>

<h5>IV.</h5>

<p>It is idle to deny that the present is a period of
financial strain. The new colonies are solvent, but the
margin is narrow. Like everything else in South
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Africa, their finances are on a needle-point, and require
strenuous intelligence and constant economy. I have
taken the railway profits and customs receipts as incapable
of falling below their present level; but it is to
be remembered that the past year is not a fair basis
for prophecy, since the country has been in process of
reconstruction, and the heavy importations for the
purpose have swollen receipts in both departments.
If industrial progress is still retarded, both figures will
sink enormously, and the whole system of finance
sketched in the preceding pages will require revision.
If, on the other hand, progress is assured, both figures
will increase largely, since, while this basis is high as
compared with the present situation, it is low compared
with any real prosperity. In this case the
strain will be of short duration. <i>Ce n&rsquo;est que le
premier pas qui co{te.</i> Industrial development lies
at the root of all things. The Transvaal can only
hope for a large permanent increase of revenue from
the licences and profit tax paid by the mining industry
and from Customs receipts drawn from a wider basis
of population. Unless this increase comes she may be
unable to meet her own war debt, or to contribute
anything to an inter-colonial deficit. Inter-colonial
revenues, too, can only expand from the same cause,
for mining prosperity is at the bottom of railway
profits. The State finances depend upon mining
development, and mining development depends on
labour: this is the true statement of the problem, and
all others are involved in a vicious circle. And this is
as it should be. On the great industry of the country
the chief burden must lie.</p>

<p>There is, of course, the possibility of windfalls.
From the Crown share of gold and diamond properties
very large sums of money may from time to time flow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
to the Exchequer. But it is the part of a prudent
finance minister to base his forecasts on the normal
only, and to accept windfalls as gifts of Providence,
to be used for special purposes. It may be necessary
to draw upon this source of income to meet the debt
charges; but, should this misfortune be spared us, then
we have in such windfalls the nucleus of a reserve fund
for development. There is need, as we have seen, of a
capital outlay on development far beyond that provided
for in the Guaranteed Loan. Railway extension alone,
before we have done with it, will need not 5 millions,
but 10, and, in cases where new lines are built by
private companies, we shall have to face sooner or later
a considerable expenditure on expropriation. Public
works, when all the loan moneys have been spent, will
still be badly provided for. It may be necessary, too,
to spend money in expropriating land for public parks,
for game preserves, for public buildings, for new townships,&mdash;expenditure
which in the first instance will fall
upon the Government. So, too, with other schemes,&mdash;irrigation,
the search for artesian water, the establishment
of colleges and technical schools, and all the
thousand activities of government in a new country,
which will grow quickly and develop early a multitude
of needs. Lastly, land settlement in the two colonies,
if it is to serve the social and political purpose which
is its chief justification, demands more than the 3
millions allotted to it. Such expenditure is in the
fullest sense an investment, since the bulk of it will be
returned in time to the Exchequer with a reasonable
interest. It is proposed that, in so far as repayments
of capital from settlers are concerned, such repayments
should form a special fund, which can go out again
in fresh advances and further purchases of land. In
this way a permanent fund for settlement will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
created, and the project will not be dependent upon
a share of any annual surplus.</p>

<p>The economic problem of the new colonies finds
a parallel in Egyptian reconstruction in more ways
than the analogy of the <i>Caisse de la Dette</i>. There
is the same undeveloped wealth in the country, the
same heavy bondage of debt, the same demand for
reproductive expenditure. To cut down the cost of
living and the restraints on production, and at the
same time to provide money for development and for
the charges of an unproductive debt, is the threefold
South African problem, as it was the Egyptian.
Solvency here, as there, is to be found in an equipoise,
and requires a nice and discriminating statesmanship
rather than any heroic cutting of knots. In most
respects the Egyptian difficulty was far the greater,
for there the cast-iron debt regulations and the
endless European surveillance frustrated at every
turn the efforts of her statesmen. But one danger
was absent. In Egypt patience and diplomacy, faith
in the country and in the work of time, were so
obviously the only cards to play, that, while there
were many temptations to lose heart and abandon
the struggle, there was no inducement to try short
cuts and forsake the true path of policy for those
showy and unconsidered measures which in the rare
event of their success are called heroic. In South
Africa the amateur financier is so abroad in the land
that we may look to find many odd nostrums advocated
to ensure prosperity. The kind of discussion
which arose over the labour difficulty is a guide to
what we may expect in the realm of high finance.
But in both the one and the other the real problem
is plain once the obscuration caused by conflicting
interests is cleared away by a little common-sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
The great questions of economics in relation to state
growth are always simple. If high finance means
anything it is the power of adding two and two
together. Complicated financial adjustments belong
to a lower plane: the great financier may have no
aptitude in reducing results to a decimal. But there
is this distinction, that whereas in the intricate
calculations of secondary finance the figures are mere
counters, the elaboration of accepted data, in the
higher and simpler finance they are symbols. To the
statesman they are the gauge of prosperity or decline,
and behind them stand the millions of workers, the
miles of crops, the floods and droughts and pestilences,
the rise and fall of industries, the ore in the mine, the
web in the factory, the cattle in the stockyard. The
yield of a land tax is to him not a figure but a
symbol, and in using it he has regard not only to
its formal place in estimates and returns, but to its
political meaning. It is, if you like, the quality
which in other spheres constitutes the distinction
between statesmen and high permanent officials,
between economists and statisticians, between all
leaders and all subordinates. In the finance of a
country which is still in process of reconstruction,
this power, so uncommon and so inestimable, of
getting behind figures to facts, and keeping the
hand on the pulse of national progress, is the only
guarantee of ultimate success. In this light the
prospects of the new colonies give good reason for
hope. The budget of to-day, formally regarded, shows
a delicate equipoise, in which a pessimist might find
material for dark forebodings; but it is only the
symbol of that stress of re-creation which must
precede an ample prosperity.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<h4>THE SETTLEMENT OF THE LAND.</h4>

<h5>I.</h5>

<p>To the Boer the land was the beginning and end of
all things: a town was only a necessary excrescence, an
industry an uitlander whim. A land policy is therefore
one of the first burdens which attend our heritage.
Happily we are not seriously impeded by the wreckage
of systems which have failed. The Boer Government
had no land legislation, and the few laws, such as the
Occupation Law of 1886, which touched on the question,
were less statutory enactments than administrative
resolutions. The Boer farmer, or his father,
secured his land when the country was unoccupied,
and he had merely to arrange the boundary question
with friendly neighbours. He held it on freehold
title, with no reservation of quit-rent to the Government.
When the existing population had thus been
settled, the balance of unoccupied country fell to the
State; and this was further parcelled out by grants
to poor burghers, doles for war service, establishment
of native reserves, and in the wilder districts by the
system of occupation tenure. But in spite of all
grants a considerable portion remained State territory&mdash;over
44,000 square miles in the Transvaal, of which
at least 19,000,000 acres are unsurveyed. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
Orange River Colony the State lands are smaller, not
exceeding, with all recent purchases, 1,400,000 acres.
The land question in the two colonies is therefore of
the simplest: the best farms, including most of the
rich pockets of alluvial land, are the freehold possession
of a small number of Dutch farmers; the balance
is the more or less encumbered perquisite of the State.</p>

<p>The condition of agriculture in the two colonies was
primitive in the extreme, a truth quite independent of
the question whether such elementary methods were
not the only possible. The first comers were pastoralists
and nothing more, coming as they did from the
great pastoral regions in the north of Cape Colony.
The average farm was laid out for stock, and was
rarely less than 6000 acres. On the old estimate eight
acres was required for each head of horned cattle and
two for each sheep. The Boer was not an advanced
stock-farmer in any sense of the word. He found
certain diseases indigenous to the country which he did
not seriously attempt to cope with. He rarely fenced
his stock-routes and outspans or endeavoured to improve
the carrying capacity of the land by paddocking.
The high veld in winter is burned brown by sun and
wind and nipped by frosts, so that it gives little
sustenance to stock; but the rich vegetation in
summer should have provided, by means of ensilage,
ample feeding for the winter months. This simple
device was never used, and when the grass failed
the Boer trekked with his herds to his low-veld
farm, whence he frequently brought back the seeds of
disease in his animals. In the quality of his stock he
was equally backward. In the Afrikander ox he had
the makings of one of the hardiest and strongest
draught animals in the world. In the Afrikander
pony he had the basis of a wonderful breed of riding-horses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
to whose merits the late war has sufficiently
testified. He never seriously tried to improve one or
the other. Stallions of wretched quality were allowed
to run wild among his mares, and he had no system
of culling to raise the quality of his herds. The
market for his beef and mutton was small and uncritical,
so that the amassing of animals became with
him rather the sign visible of prosperity than a serious
professional enterprise.</p>

<p>At first the Boer did little more than till a garden.
On each farm there was a certain water-supply, and
around the spruit or fountain a pocket of alluvial
land. The ordinary soil, both in the Transvaal and
the Orange River Colony, is, with some remarkable
exceptions, poor and easily worked out; but those
alluvial patches are so rich as to be practically inexhaustible.
The Boer and the Kaffir shared one
gift in common, an infallible eye for good country,
though there was this difference between them that
the Boer chose the heavy river-side lands, while the
Kaffir, who was a shallow cultivator, preferred as a
rule the lighter slopes where he could pick with
ease. In 1885 the Boer farmer did little more than
irrigate his garden; but the increase in the population
of the towns, and the growth of a market for
cereals, fruits, and vegetables, made him extend his
irrigation farther, so that in a few years the whole
of his alluvial pocket was under water. Formerly
he had been a pure pastoralist; now he became
also an agriculturist, and after his fashion a narrow-minded
one, for irrigation, which was his first successful
experiment, was at once exalted by him into
an axiomatic law. The Kaffir, who in his way is
a skilful farmer and an experimentalist on a far
wider scale, believed in dry lands; but the Boer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
confined himself to his irrigation and his summer
and winter crops. Two views have been promulgated
on the Boer method. One is, that it is the
true and only type possible in the country, discovered
after long years of intelligent experience. The Boer,
it is said, is unprogressive, because he knows the
limitations under which he works, and all new-comers
who have begun by trying new methods have sooner
or later fallen into line with the old inhabitants.
The supporters of this view point to the scarcity of
English farmers in the land who have made a success
of their farms on any other than the Boer methods.
There seems to be no real justification for this opinion.
The Boer has no settled principles of farming; he
is an experimentalist in practice, whatever he may
be in theory. We have seen that he began as a
pastoralist, advanced to be also a gardener, and is
now a cultivator of lands under irrigation. In some
twenty years, had he been allowed to develop unchecked,
he would doubtless have come round to the
Kaffir view of the dry lands. Fifteen years ago the
country store-keeper stocked only the old single-furrow
wooden plough: to-day on Boer farms you
may see double-furrow steel ploughs, disc ploughs,
disc cultivators, not to speak of such elaborate farm
machinery as aermotors, reapers and binders, steam
chaff-cutters, and in some few cases steam-ploughs.
The more progressive Boers have changed utterly
their methods of orchard-management, and at the
present moment they are reconsidering their methods
of tobacco-growing. The point is important, because
if the Boer has really found out long ago the limitations
of the soil and the only principles of farming,
then so far from deserving the name of unprogressive
he has shown himself eminently wise. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
theory of Boer stability is a chimera. He changes
every year in his attitude towards the soil,&mdash;changes
unwillingly, it may be, but certainly; and though
a few dogmas take a long time to alter, they alter
in the end. It is equally incorrect to argue from
the absence of successful immigrant farmers on progressive
lines. They were few in number, because
in a country where the rural population was mainly
hostile, the new-comers who began by farming ended
as a rule by drifting to the towns. But, to cite
one case, mealies have been grown on dry lands on
the American plan with great profit to the farmer;
and the German tobacco-planters in the north have
shown how profitable fruit and tobacco growing can
become, if conducted on principles rather than on
tradition.</p>

<p>But it is as great a mistake to regard the Boer
farmer as utterly without capacity. He had no need
to bestir himself. He lived simply and supplied his
own modest needs. He saw his farm going up in
price through the general appreciation of land values,
and he sold a bit now and again and increased his
herds; or he might receive a large sum for the option
on the minerals under the soil. He was cheated by
the country store-keeper, and he rarely attempted
to reach distant markets. The old vicious system
of allowing natives to farm on his land in return
for a certain amount of compulsory labour&mdash;a system
unchanged by that abortive piece of law-making, the
Plakkerswet&mdash;made him unthrifty and improvident.
He had no labour bill to cast up, no financial position
which wanted investigation at each year&rsquo;s end. Hence
the difficulty of framing any accurate forecast of the
prospects of farming in the new colonies: there are
no statistics to follow, no scale of values for land
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
or produce. But the Boer had an empirical science
of his own. He knew exactly the capacity of his
irrigated land, though he never thought of formulating
his knowledge. He had many rough and
effective precautions against blight and disease, and
he had a kind of gipsy veterinary skill. He was
not industrious, but I think he must be allowed the
credit of having done his best for the land on his
own principles. He was a great buyer of new farm
machinery, partly perhaps out of curiosity, and on
this point at least his conservatism was not consistent.
Some of his methods were based on common rural
superstitions&mdash;for example, he always sowed, if possible,
at the full moon. His habit, too, of seeking
a theological explanation of all misfortunes was
destructive of energy. When the locusts or the
<i>galziekte</i> came he lit his pipe and said it was the
will of God, a visitation which it would be impious
to resist. Hardly, perhaps, the proper attitude for
success in this modern world, but under his peculiar
conditions he never felt its folly. It is impossible to
believe that the Boer has done justice to the country,
but we may readily grant him skill and good sense
in the narrow world in which he dwelt.</p>

<p>The land problem in the new colonies is partly
political and partly economic, and on the solution
of the latter branch of the question the former largely
depends. There are urgent reasons why an English
population should grow up on the land; but unless
this population can make a profitable living it would
be folly to encourage its immigration. On this economic
question it is impossible to dogmatise. Data, as
I have said, are lacking and have never existed. At
the best we can frame some sort of tentative answer&mdash;a
hope rather than a promise; and we are justified in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
this course because those who attack the policy have
no better argument to offer.</p>

<p>Before the war the ordinary farmer sold his stock
and his produce at fair prices in his country town.
The bulk of it, together with the produce which
the more enterprising farmers sent direct, went to
Johannesburg, where on the whole high prices were
maintained. So good were the prices that the farmers
of the eastern and western provinces of Cape Colony
found it profitable, notwithstanding customs and heavy
railway freights, to make Johannesburg their chief
market. But in spite of all local production, Johannesburg
was not fully supplied. Food-stuffs in large
quantities had to be imported from abroad. In 1898
agricultural produce, raw and manufactured, to the
value of nearly #2,500,000 was imported into the
Transvaal. Arguing on these facts, many have predicted
a rosy future for all branches of South African
farming. What has been imported, they say, can be
grown; the mining industry will advance, and agriculture
will follow with equal steps. But such rudimentary
hopes can scarcely be held to exhaust a
very complicated and delicate problem, to which
some answer must be suggested before any needs
of policy can be thought of. There are two questions
to be met: How far is the land capable of intensive
and sustained production? and, granting the capacity,
what guarantee is there of profitable markets?</p>

<p>The soil of the new colonies, as I have said, is
sharply divided into alluvial pockets and dry lands,&mdash;the
former highly cultivated, the latter, except for
Kaffir locations, mainly neglected. But since for one
alluvial acre there are a hundred dry morgen, the
progress of the country may be said to depend upon
the dry lands. It follows that pasturage must remain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
the staple form of farming. The bulk of the
dry lands are light and thin in soil, and the natural
humours of the ground have been much exhausted
by the unthrifty habit of veld-burning. But in spite
of all drawbacks it is a country of abundant summer
grass, both sweet veld and sour veld, which is capable
of great improvement by any proper system of
paddocking and depasturing. Large quantities of
veld grass might be cut for winter fodder, and
roots and forage crops could be grown in summer
for the same purpose. Farms, which at present carry
an ox to every eight acres and a sheep to every two,
might be made capable of supporting a vastly greater
stock. But there are certain drawbacks to stock-farming
peculiar to the country, the chief being the
number of diseases indigenous and imported. At
the present moment to bring in valuable stock to
most districts of the new colonies is a dangerous experiment.
Horses die of horse-sickness, sheep of scab
and anthrax, cattle of rinderpest, red-water, and the
immense variety of <i>ziektes</i> from <i>galziekte</i> to <i>gielziekte</i>.
Before the new colonies can advance to the rank of
great pastoral lands which is their right, vigorous
methods must be taken to stamp out diseases wherever
they appear, and to take precautions against
their recurrence. The country must be fenced, stock-routes
and outspans must be established and guarded,
and a stringent Brands Act must be passed to give
security to the stock-owner in a country where stock
is notoriously prone to vanish.<a name="FNanchor_24_24"
id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
Given good laws, adequately administered, the
Transvaal and the Orange River Colony may well
become countries of large and prosperous stock-farms.
Here, it has been argued, the matter ends. Agriculture
must confine itself in most cases to the growth
of domestic supplies and winter forage. I cannot, after
a careful examination of most parts of the country,
bring myself to accept this view. Much may be done
by irrigation to increase the area of land under water.
Sir W. Willcocks&rsquo; Report<a name="FNanchor_25_25"
id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
proposes to give to South
Africa 3,000,000 acres of perennially irrigated land
at a cost of about #30,000,000; but as he argues for
the undertaking on the basis of certain doubtful land
valuations, this large estimate may have to be considerably
modified. Unirrigated land, he says, varies
from 2s. 6d. to #3 per acre: irrigation costs from
#7, 10s. to #15 per acre; and the price of good irrigated
land runs from #20 to #100. On this reasoning
there is room for a handsome profit, but the argument
is based rather on fictitious market values than on the
intrinsic normal producing power of the soil. At the
time when Sir W. Willcocks&rsquo; Report was written&mdash;the
last year of the war&mdash;land values were inflated, and
the prices of produce grown under water were extremely
high. In the average year for which we must
provide little irrigated land will be worth to the
farmer more than from #5 to #10 per acre, and
certain irrigation schemes which, on Sir W. Willcocks&rsquo;
showing would return a profit, would in reality spell
ruin to their promoters. Irrigation is necessary on a
certain scale for a reason which we shall discuss later;
and in many cases it could be effected at a moderate
cost. But expensive irrigation works for agriculture
alone are, I believe, of doubtful wisdom in almost every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
part of the country. What is of infinitely greater importance
is the procuring of water in the dry tracts
by tanks, wells, and, if possible, by artesian bores.
Vast stock districts in Waterberg and Lichtenburg
would have their value quadrupled if a permanent
supply of water, even for stock purposes only, could
be procured. The Australian method of tank-sinking
has already been followed with success in the Springbok
Flats, and it is at least possible that artesian
water may be found. Everywhere the soil contains
water at a low depth, which percolates through the
porous rock, and is brought to a stand by dykes of
harder stone. Hence has arisen the old African fiction
of underground rivers, which is true to the extent that
no man has far to dig before he finds water. It is
rather with such tank- and well-sinking that a water
expert should deal, and with the regulation of the
present ridiculous apportionment of water rights. No
serious work can be done in this department till the
State assumes the right of distributing water, and has
it in its power to prevent the riparian owner from
following an obstructive course to the detriment of
his neighbours. Irrigation in a few cases should be
followed, and a greater portion of land brought under
water in the interests of mixed farming; but it is in
another direction that we must look for the sheet-anchor
of South African agriculture.</p>

<p>The rainfall of the new colonies is generally well
distributed. Copious rains fall from September to
April, and then come the four dry and windy months
of winter. On irrigated lands summer and winter
crops are grown; on dry lands a summer crop only.
But the Boer believed that the crops which he could
grow on dry lands were very limited, and he habitually
grew mealies, potatoes, lucerne, and tobacco under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
water. It is, of course, a great advantage to reap two
crops a-year; but if a man can get two crops from
5 acres only and one crop from 500, this one crop, on
ordinary principles of common-sense, should command
his chief attention. Deducting the greater expense
for labour, the one crop is still thirty or forty times as
important as the other two. This is roughly the agricultural
problem of the dry lands. They have never
been really exploited. The Kaffir has picked at the
edges; a few progressive farmers have made good
profits by growing mealies and tobacco dry on the
American plan. But it was much easier to potter
about with a water-furrow than to attempt to plough
the dry and unbroken flats. Dry-land farming is
therefore pioneer farming, and pioneering with a good
hope of success. Granted the markets, there is no
reason why great tracts should not be ploughed from
end to end, and a huge crop of cereals and roots raised
yearly. Steam-ploughing and every labour-saving
device will be necessary, for this is farming on the
grand scale. The outlook is made brighter when we
realise that those despised dry lands are some of the
richest in the country. The famous Standerton black
soil, the environs of Middelburg, part of the Bloemhof
and Klerksdorp districts, and, above all, the Springbok
Flats,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a
href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> where there may be half a
million acres
of the richest black soil 12 feet deep, and another half
million acres of excellent red soil&mdash;such are a few
instances of lands which await an early development.</p>

<p>There is still another aspect of this problem which
concerns a small group of semi-tropical products&mdash;fruits,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
tobacco, rubber, coffee, and, possibly, cocoa.
There are tracts which have proved themselves to be
as highly fitted for such crops as any in the world.
They are crops, too, for which the acreage required is
small, and whose value is so high in proportion to bulk
that the freightage does not seriously detract from
profits. Given, again, the market, and there is no
reason why the present yield should not be centupled.</p>

<p>The market&mdash;that is the rock on which arguments
divide. The rosy hopes of the market to be furnished
by the Transvaal which some minds entertained during
the war have given place with many to an equally
fantastic pessimism. I do not propose to provide
a tabulated statement of costs and prices. I have
seen such statements arrive by the clearest reasoning
at opposite conclusions. But it is worth while to
consider soberly what are the market prospects in the
future for the farmer of the new colonies. A comparison
of imports gives little assistance. In the year
1902 the raw agricultural produce imported into the
Transvaal, all of which might be locally produced,
was worth over 2 millions sterling; and the imports
of manufactured and partially manufactured produce,
the bulk of which might be produced and manufactured
locally, came close on another million. These
figures may be taken as below normal, since supplies
for the army of occupation are not included, and at
the same time the number of inhabitants in the towns
and natives in the mines were largely below the ordinary
figures. On the other hand, little agriculture
existed, and practically all supplies for the existing
population, such as it was, had to be brought from
the adjoining colonies or from over-seas. On this
basis, therefore, there is a considerable and highly
profitable market for the limited agriculture and pastoral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
enterprise of the country. But in framing any
forecast two new factors must be taken into consideration.
If the towns are to develop, the cost of living
must be greatly reduced; which means in the first instance
that all ordinary food-stuffs must be imported
free of duty and at cheap railway rates. Again,
when all the Boer farmers have been resettled on
their lands and a multitude of new-comers occupy
Crown farms, the local agricultural output will be
very largely increased. The farmer, who at the
moment can sell his garden stuff, his crops of potatoes,
mealies, and forage, and his stock at a good
profit, will find himself faced by over-sea produce,
grown wholesale under the most favourable conditions,
and sold at a price with which he cannot compete
and live. This is, I think, a true forecast&mdash;for the
small improvident farmer. The man who grows mealies
on a large scale with labour-saving appliances, or who
has a well-managed stock-ranch, will make a profit on
wholesale dealings. In agriculture and pasturage,
as in other activities, Providence is on the side of the
bigger battalions, and the small man who grows on
an expensive scale will be pushed out by the large
man who grows economically. Prophecy is an intricate
task, especially on land questions, but it seems clear
that the only class who will not have to dread to
some extent a change in present conditions, a cheapening
of the means of life, and the influx of a large
agricultural population, will be the wholesale farmers
and pastoralists, who follow the methods of over-sea
producers and enjoy the advantage of living at their
customers&rsquo; doors.</p>

<p>But this does not exhaust the question. Is, then,
the small holder of 100 or 200 acres, or the owner of
a mixed farm of 1000 acres, to become extinct in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
land? It depends entirely on themselves. In districts
such as Waterberg, Zoutpansberg, and Barberton,
the holder of 50 acres under water will be able to put
vegetables and fruit on the Rand market a fortnight
before any other grower in the world. His price is
assured beyond doubt; and if he may find little profit
for six months in the year, he is in no worse case than
many prosperous market-gardeners in Kent and Surrey.
It is here that the value of irrigation appears. Such a
small holder, again, may be able to make a profit from
dairying all the year round, provided local creameries
are established, and he goes the proper way about it.
So, too, with mixed farming, of which the essence is
that one product can be set off against another. If
a farmer finds cereals unproductive, he can put part
of his land into pasture; it is unlikely that the price
of meat will fall below a paying point, granted the
expected industrial development. In addition there
are certain crops, such as tobacco, where the profits,
even allowing for a large decline in present prices, are
great, the freightage small, and the market worldwide.
The aim of mixed farming is to provide an
elaborate system of alternate schemes, which between
them will preserve a fairly permanent average of
profit.</p>

<p>The basis of all farming prosperity is the growth of
the mining industry and the creation of new industries.
Any attempt to protect farming by tolls or imposts
is foredoomed to a miserable failure. Sink, if
necessary, farming considerations altogether for the
moment; look only to mining development, if need
be; abolish the old market prices and ruin the old
local producer: it is all good policy, and in the long-run
the true agricultural interest. When the present
fictitious basis is got rid of, the true and lasting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
agricultural prosperity may begin. There seems no
reason to doubt that in the future there will be a
sound local market for the large producer, for the
favourably situated small holder, and for the judicious
farmer of mixed land. Nor is there any reason why
in time a considerable export trade should not be
established. As the great produce-exporting countries
of the world grow more populous, South Africa may
yet play its part in feeding Europe. With improved
internal communications, and thousands of miles of
fine pasture land, there is no reason why, a fortnight
nearer Europe than Australia, she should not take her
share of the frozen-meat traffic of the world. In
tobacco, again, to take only one instance, a very considerable
export trade may arise. The soil is well
suited; the rough leaf, grown on the most unscientific
method, is as good as anything produced by Virginia
and Borneo. The large tobacco-growers, or the small
holders attached to a tobacco-factory, may very well
find a profitable outlet for their wares abroad, and
the English manufacturers discover a new producing
ground in a British colony with which to resist the
attacks of transatlantic combines.</p>

<p>The farming prospects in the new colonies, even if
stripped of all fanciful stuff, are sound and hopeful.
There may come bad times for all. The ordinary
market-gardener will for a certainty find himself
poorly off five years hence; and all classes may have
their periods of stress and despair. Such visitations
are part of the primeval curse upon tillers of the soil.
The New Zealand and Australian pastoralists had
sunk very low before the discovery of cold storage
saved the situation. The Ceylon planters, after the
coffee blight, seemed on the brink of ruin, when the
introduction of tea-growing more than restored their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
former prosperity. An immunity from farming risks
can no more be guaranteed in the new colonies than
in other countries. The real question is, Can they
offer the settler no greater risks than he has to face
elsewhere, and at least a fair chance of greater prosperity?
On a reasonable survey of the case, I think
it will be found that they can.</p>

<p>With this clearing of the ground we can turn with
an open mind to the political question. The secular
antithesis of town and country is as marked here as
elsewhere, and the political problem varies accordingly.
In the country we have to create in a large measure
from the foundation; we have to meet and nullify the
prevailing apathy, and undertake as a Government
many tasks which would elsewhere be left to private
enterprise. There the wounds of war gape more
widely, and have to be healed by more cunning
simples. People have spoken as if the towns were
the sole factor in the case. Make the towns prosperous
and wholly British, it has been said, and the
land is ours. The towns are the loyal units; as they
advance in prosperity the rural districts will sink out
of account; and rightly, for their wealth is small,
their population hostile, and their future barren.
&ldquo;Twenty years hence,&rdquo; wrote in 1896 an observer
as clear-sighted as he was hopeful, &ldquo;the white population
is likely to be composed in about equal proportions
of urban and rural elements. The urban element
will be mainly mining, gathered at one great centre
on the Witwatersrand, and possibly at some smaller
centres in other districts. The rural element, consisting
of people who live in villages or solitary farmhouses,
will remain comparatively backward, because
little affected by the social forces which work swiftly
and potently upon close-packed industrial communities,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
and it may find itself very different in tone,
temper, and tendencies from its urban fellow-citizens.&rdquo;<a
name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27"
class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
So we find one class of mine-owners arguing that any
attempt to settle the country districts is a work of
supererogation, and urging the Government to concentrate
all its efforts on the promotion of their own
industry, declaring that from their prosperity every
blessing will flow forth to the rural parts. It is
impossible to contemplate with equanimity the result
of merely letting things alone. No industrial development
would ever compensate for it, for the unleavened
Dutch rural districts would become centres to collect
and focus and stereotype the old unfaltering dislike.
A hard-and-fast division between town and country
is always to be feared; but when the barrier is
between white men, and is built up of race, wealth,
and civilisation, it can only be a dire calamity. We
cannot rear up for our children a race of helots, and
by our very exclusiveness solidify for all time an
irreconcilable race division. If we preserve such an
enemy within our bounds, and just beyond our gates,
the time may come when a few isolated townships
will represent Britain in South Africa. To prevent
this cleavage, urban and rural development should
advance with equal steps. The two races will be
joined not by any trivial sentimental devices, but by
the partnership of Dutch and British farmers in the
enlightened development of the land.</p>

<p>There is another and a profounder reason for this
introduction of British blood. The day may come
when the South African, splendid as has been his
loyalty and many his sacrifices, may go the way of
most colonists, and lose something of that close touch
with the mother-country which is necessary in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
interests of a federated empire. It is always the
temptation of town-dwellers, with their busy life and
their own engrossing interests, and the tremendous
mixture of alien blood in the country may serve to
hasten this result beyond the ordinary rate of colonial
progress. But the country settler is a different
person. He retains a longer and simpler affection
for the country of his birth. An influx of such a class
would consolidate South African sentiment, and, when
self-government comes, protect imperial interests
better than any constitutional guarantee. This is
the class which has the true stake in the country,
deriving its life from the nurture of the earth, striving
with winds and weather, and slowly absorbing into
the fibre of its being those influences which make for
race and patriotism.</p>

<p>South African agriculture, as the shrewdest
observers have long foreseen, could never be improved
until there arose a political reason for its
improvement. The reason for the experiment has
arrived, and its basis is in existence. In the inheritance
of Crown lands which remains from the mismanaged
estate of the late Government, and in the
long lists of ex-irregulars and others who sought land,
there was the raw material of settlement. It is no
case for flamboyant prophecies. The certain difficulties
are as great as the probable advantages. But
to shrink from those difficulties is to have towns
where British ideas of government, can be realised
and outside vast rural districts, suspicious, unfriendly,
potentially dangerous; to neglect a golden opportunity
of increasing the British element in South
Africa; and to turn the back upon farming, which
must always be the most permanent asset of any
nation. The determinant fact in the case is that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
alternative is so black that all risks must be faced
rather than accept it. With such considerations in
mind, the Government put forth a scheme of settlement,
with the examination of which the remainder
of this chapter is concerned. It is not my business to
write the history of the Crown Colony administration,
and therefore no time need be given to the many
difficulties which faced the scheme, the mistakes
made, and the hopeful results attained in certain
cases. It is the problem itself which demands attention,
and the adequacy or inadequacy of the policy
which has been framed to meet it. Land settlement
is from its very nature a slow business, with
tardy fruits: twenty years hence we may be in a
position to judge by results. But in the meantime
it is possible, when the data are known, to ascertain
whether a policy is on <i>a priori</i> grounds adapted to
meet them.</p>

A Fencing Act, a Stock-Route Act, and a Brands Act on the most
progressive lines have been prepared for the Transvaal. An excellent
Fencing Act, badly administered, has always existed in the Orange River
Colony, and a Brands Act, inferior to the Transvaal measure, has been
passed in that colony. But it is the effective administration of the Acts
which is of importance.</p>

<h5>II.</h5>

<p>The Crown lands of the Transvaal, as I have said,
amount to upwards of 29 million acres, the Crown
lands of the Orange River Colony to under 1&frac12; million.
So far as the latter colony is concerned, land settlement
is rather in the nature of estate management.
The lands are too small for any serious political purpose,
nor would the most extended settlement make
much impression upon the solid Dutch rural community.
But in the Transvaal the Crown in several
districts is by far the largest landowner, and in others
it holds the key of the position. Take a Transvaal
map coloured according to ownership, and red is easily
the master colour. A solid block of it occupies the
north-east corner; large islands of it appear in the
western and eastern borders; and the centre is plentifully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
dotted. Save in the little known north-east
those lands are generally pasture, and in too many
cases dry and arid bush-veld. In the Standerton
district, and in parts of Rustenburg, Potchefstroom,
and Bloemhof, there are tracts of good irrigated or
irrigable lands; while in Barberton, Lydenburg, Zoutpansberg,
and Marico there are considerable districts
well watered and well suited for tropical and sub-tropical
products. Taken as a whole, however, only
a small portion of the Crown holding is suitable for
early settlement&mdash;say 2&frac12; million acres within the
next three years. But there is a wide hinterland for
development, and in settlement, as in empire, a hinterland
is a moral necessity. There must be an open
country to which the sons of farmers, in whom the
love of the life is born, can trek as pioneers, otherwise
there is a futile division into smaller holdings, or a
more futile exodus to the towns. Besides, there
should be room for the townsman&mdash;the miner, the
artisan, the trader&mdash;to feel that there is somewhere
an open country where he can invest his savings if he
has a mind for a simpler life. As railways spread out
into new districts, land will become agricultural which
is now pasture; and, as the pastoral industry develops
and herds are formed and diseases are mastered, the
ranchman will occupy large tracts of what is now the
unused hunting-veld.</p>

<p>The Government scheme aims at making a beginning
with this settlement&mdash;a beginning only, for no
government has ever been able to reconstruct alone, and
the bulk of the work must be done by private enterprise.
If 2000 farmers from England and the colonies
can be settled in the rural parts before the day of
stress arrives, then the work has been fairly started.
A nucleus will have been formed to which the years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
will add, an element which will both leaven the slow
and suspicious rustic society and provide a make-weight
against the parochialism of the great towns.
A country party is wanted which can look beyond
the dorp and the mine-head, and view South African
interests broadly and soberly. Such a party must be
common to both town and country, but it cannot be
built up wholly from either. It must, in the first
instance, be a British party; but if this British party
is to become a South African party, it must stand for
interests common to both races and to all classes.
The formation of this leavening element cannot be
left to time and chance, but must be aided by conscious
effort. The land is largely unproved, and full
of dangers to crops and stock. The new-comer must
therefore be treated gently, and helped over the
many stiles which confront him. He will usually be
a man of small means, and his limited capital must
be put to the best use, and eked out with judicious
Government advances. He should have few payments
to make during his early years, when payments will
necessarily come out of capital. Above all, the
acquirement of the full freehold in his land on reasonable
terms, and within a reasonable time, should be
kept constantly before him as an encouragement to
thrift and industry, for the sense of freehold, as the
voortrekkers used to say, &ldquo;turns sand into gold.&rdquo;
Much of the Crown lands will never be suitable for
any but the largest stockholders. These it is easy to
deal with as a mere matter of estate-management;
but the political purport of the scheme is concerned
with intensive settlement, with the small holder and
the mixed farmer of moderate means, who can provide
a solid colony of mutually supporting and progressive
Englishmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
The Transvaal &ldquo;Settlers&rsquo; Ordinance&rdquo; of 1902 is
based upon the mass of legislation which embodies the
settlement schemes of the Australasian colonies. The
usual method in such experiments has been to begin
in desperate fear of the settler, tying him up with
cast-iron rules, and ruining him in a very few years.
Then the pendulum swings back, and settlement is
made easy and profitable, the old safeguards are
abolished, and the land becomes full of rich squatters
and companies, who fatten on State munificence
through the numerous dummy settlers in their pay.
Finally, after long years a compromise is effected, and
that shy creature, the <i>bonb-fide</i> settler, is sought for
far and near. By this time it is probable that the
thing has got a bad name, and men whose fathers and
grandfathers lost money under former schemes, are
chary of trusting themselves again to the tender
mercies of a land-owning State. This, or something
like it, has been the experience of the Australasian
colonies. Either land was given out indiscriminately
and a valuable State asset cheaply parted with, or the
conditions of tenure were such as to ruin the small
holder and put everything in the hands of a few rich
syndicates. The land laws of Australia and New
Zealand form, therefore, a most valuable precedent.
We have their experiments before our eyes, and can
learn from their often disastrous experience.</p>

<p>Settlement in New South Wales, to take one instance,
was begun partly as a Treasury expedient
and partly as an election cry. Under the Act of 1867
a settler was allowed to peg off, as on a mining area,
a claim not exceeding 320 acres, without any attempt
at a previous valuation and survey. The result was a
wild rush, where nobody benefited except the blackmailer,
who seized the strategic points of the country,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
such as water-holes, and had to be bought out at a
fancy price. It does not surprise one to learn that of
settlers under this scheme not one in twenty remains
to-day. By subsequent Acts the maximum acreage
was increased; but in any case it was an arbitrary
figure, and it was not till 1895 that it was left within
the widest limits to the discretion of the Minister
of Lands. Areas proved too small, since no provision
could be made for the increase of stock and the necessary
fall in prices which attended settlement. In
valuation the extraordinary plan was adopted of giving
a uniform capital value of #1 per acre to all land.
The country being unproved, values were absolutely
unknown, nor was any provision made for revaluation.
The result was that the settler struggled along till he
was ruined and his holding forfeited, when the holding
lapsed to the State, which, being unable to find a new
tenant, was compelled to let it remain vacant, having
accomplished nothing but the needless ruin of the
first man. The &ldquo;Settlers&rsquo; Ordinance&rdquo; has endeavoured
to avoid laying down any rules which experience
has not tried and tested. The determination of the
size of any holding is left to the land officials, without
defining any area limits. A holding which proves too
small may be increased on appeal, and the boundaries
are at all times made capable of adjustment. Holdings
are first surveyed and valued, then gazetted for application,
and finally publicly allotted, after full inquiry
into the case of each applicant, by a Central Board.
The division and valuation of farms, in the absence of
reliable data, is a work of great nicety and difficulty.
The country contains within its limits many districts
which differ widely in soil, vegetation, and climate.
It is therefore impossible, in deciding on the size of
holdings, to follow any arbitrary rule; and to restrict
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
survey to a maximum and minimum acreage would be
fatal. The only method is to ascertain from local
evidence the carrying and producing capacity of similar
land, and so frame the boundaries of a farm as to
provide on such figures a reasonably good living for
the class of settler for whom it is intended. The
danger of putting too high a price on land is not less
great. If the current market price is taken it will in
most instances be overvalued, and in any case it is a
method without any justification in reason. The best
solution is probably the plan at present in use.
Schedules have been prepared for the different types
of holding, in which the profits are calculated, using as
a guide the present price of stock and imported produce
at the coast to ensure against the inevitable fall
in prices. Taking such estimated profits as a basis,
the valuation is so fixed as to give the settler, after
all living expenses, annual payments to Government,
probable loss of stock, and depreciation of plant have
been written off, a clear profit of 12 per cent on his
original capital. From this figure some further deductions
may fall to be made for such disadvantages as
unhealthiness of climate and excessive distance from
the conveniences of civilised life. In the absence of
more scientific data this seems to form as fair a basis
in valuation as any man can expect.</p>

<p>But if early Australasian legislation erred in rigour,
it also erred in laxity. The settler was often the
nominee of a syndicate or a large run-holder, and
before the 1895 Act a class of professional selectors
existed. This system of <i>latifundia</i> brought its own
punishment. The run-holder ruined the small selector.
To pay the instalments on his many selections he had
recourse to the banks, which speedily ruined him and
took over his holdings. The banks in their turn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
ruined themselves, chiefly through being obliged to
pay instalments on land valued at #1 per acre, of which
the actual value for stock was less than 5s. Again,
the settler was compelled to improve the land at the
rate of so many shillings per acre within a given time.
This led to cheap fictitious improvements by which the
letter of the law was satisfied and the spirit evaded.
The &ldquo;Settlers&rsquo; Ordinance&rdquo; has certain stringent provisions
to prevent such frustration of the true aims of
settlement. Subletting or transfer of any sort, except
with Government consent, is strictly forbidden till the
tenant has acquired the freehold. Residence for at
least eight months in the year, unless a special dispensation
is granted, is required during the same
period. The settler is compelled to build a satisfactory
house and to fence his holding within a given time.
He is compelled to occupy it solely for his own benefit,
to cultivate according to the rules of good husbandry
(whatever that may mean), and the decision of the
local Land Commissioner is the test by which he is
judged. He is encouraged to improve by the potent
fact that the Government will advance pound for
pound against his improvements. But there are
certain elastic provisions to temper the rigour of such
restrictions. The Commissioner of Lands is given a
very wide dispensing power with regard to most conditions.
Partnerships are allowed; settlers may reside
together in a village community; and the residence
conditions may be temporarily fulfilled by a wife or
child, to allow a settler in hard times to make money
by his labour elsewhere. Special relief is provided
during periods of disease or drought by the cessation
or diminution of the annual payments, and by advances
in excess of the ordinary limits.</p>

<p>The Ordinance has been framed on experimental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
lines, leaving much to the discretion of local officials
(subject to an appeal to the Central Board and thence
to the High Court), and hesitating to dogmatise on
details which are still unproved. But in spite of
much which is empirical, one or two root principles
are maintained. One is that a fair chance must be
given to all to acquire the freehold, without which
magic possibility the best men will not come forward.
Another, and perhaps the most important of all, is
that the payments to Government shall be so arranged
as to be scarcely felt during the early years when
they are paid out of capital, and to rise to any considerable
sum only when the holding is producing a
revenue. The two chief forms of tenure are leasehold
and purchase by instalments over a period of thirty
years. The common form of lease is for five years,
with a possible extension for another two, and the
rental may be at any rate (not exceeding 5 per cent)
which the Commissioner of Lands thinks suitable.
This method will enable back-country to be taken
up, to start with, at a nominal rent; and it will
also allow a settler on an unimproved stock-farm to
devote the bulk of his capital to the necessary
stocking and improvements. At the end of the lease,
or without any preliminary lease, the settler can
begin to purchase his holding on the instalments
system. By a payment of #5, 15s. per cent per
annum on the gazetted valuation, principal and
interest (which is calculated at 4 per cent) will be
wiped off in thirty years. But a settler is permitted
any time after ten years from the date of his first
occupation to pay up the balance and acquire the
full freehold. In the case of preliminary leaseholders
who take up a purchase licence, the licence, so far
as the ten years&rsquo; period is concerned, is made retrospective
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
so as to date from the first day of
the lease.</p>

<p>Such is a rough outline of the Government proposals.
They aim only at making a beginning, and
it is to the large private owner and the land company
that we must look for the completion of the work.
South African agriculture can never be a Golconda
like the Canadian wheat-lands of the West. But it
is of inestimable value to the country in providing a
background to the immense temporary mining development&mdash;a
permanent asset, which will remain to South
Africa&rsquo;s credit when the gold-mines of the Rand are
curiosities of history. In itself it is a sound investment,
offering no glittering fortunes but a steady
and reasonable livelihood. No people can afford to
develop solely on industrial lines and remain a nation
in the full sense of the word, for in every commonwealth
there is need of the rural forces of persistence
to counteract the urban forces of change. All settlement
is necessarily a leap in the dark, but, so far
as a proposal can be judged before it is put into
practice, the present scheme offers good chances of
success. There seems little doubt that it will receive
full justice. The war spread the knowledge of the
country to every cranny of the Empire. English and
Scottish farmers&rsquo; sons, Australian bushmen, Indian
planters, farmers from New Zealand and Ontario,
having fought for three years on the veld, have
fallen in love with it and are willing to make it their
home. No more splendid chances for settlement have
ever offered; for when the wastrels have been eliminated
there remain many thousands of good men,
from whom a sturdy country stock could be created.
There can be no indiscriminate gifts of land as in
some colonies. The land is too valuable, the political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
purpose too delicate and urgent, the need of nice
discrimination in selection and careful fostering thereafter
too imperative, to allow farms to be shaken up
in a lucky-bag and distributed to the first comers.
The best men must be attracted, and assisted with
advice and loans to the measure of success which is
possible. It is the soundest form of political speculation,
if done with sober and clear-sighted purpose.
The young men from home and the colonies, to whom
South Africa is a memory that can never die, turn
naturally towards it in search of a freer life and a
larger prospect. On the model farms which are being
established in each district the proverbial &ldquo;younger
sons of younger sons&rdquo; will be given a chance of learning
the requirements of the land, and so starting
work on their own account with intelligence and
economy. Some day&mdash;and may we all live to see
it!&mdash;there will be little white homesteads among trees,
and country villages and moorland farms; cattle and
sheep on a thousand hills where now only the wild
birds cry; wayside inns where the thirsty traveller
can find refreshment; and country shows where John
Smith and Johannes Smuts will compete amicably for
the King&rsquo;s premiums. And if any one thinks this
an unfounded hope, let him turn to some such book
as Ogilby&rsquo;s &lsquo;Itinerarium Anglif,&rsquo; where he will find
that in the closing years of the seventeenth century
the arable and pastoral land in England scarcely
amounted to half the area of the kingdom, and the
most fruitful orchards of Gloucestershire and Warwick
were mere heath and swamp, and, as it seemed to
an acute observer, doomed to remain so.</p>

<p>Settlement, indeed, is but one, though the most
important, of the land problems. An enlightened
agricultural department, working in conjunction with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
local societies, can do much to unite the two races
by conferring benefits which are common to both.
The introduction of pedigree stock to grade up the
existing herds is a necessity which any Boer farmer
will admit. So, too, are stringent regulations for the
prevention of disease, experiments in new crops, field
trials of new machinery, and a provision for some form
of agricultural training. Central creameries and
tobacco-factories would work wonders in increasing
the prosperity of certain districts. Something of that
tireless vigilance and alert intelligence which has
made the Agricultural Bureau of the United States
famous, a spirit which brings into agriculture the
procedure and the exact calculation of a great
business house, is necessary to meet the not insuperable
difficulties which now deter the timid, and
to give farming a chance of development commensurate
with its political importance. It is only
another case in which a South African question
stands on a razor-edge, a narrow line separating
ample success from a melancholy failure.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<h4>THE SUBJECT RACES.</h4>

<p>No question is more fraught with difficulties for the
home philosopher than this, but there is none on
which practical men have made up their mind with
such bitter completeness. The root of the trouble is
that England and South Africa talk, and will continue
to talk, in different languages on the matter. The
Englishman, using the speech of conventional politics,
seems to the colonist to talk academic nonsense; while
the South African, speaking the rough and ready
words of the practical man, appears as the champion
of brutality and coercion. The difficulties are so
real that one cannot but regret that they are complicated
by verbal misunderstandings. There is no
real divergence of views on the native question: the
distinction is rather between a seriously held opinion
and a slipshod prejudice. &ldquo;Exeter Hall&rdquo; is less
the name of a party than of an attitude, as common
among the robust colonists as ever it was among the
mild pietists of Clapham. It consists in a disinclination
to look simply on facts, to reason soberly, and to
speak accurately,&mdash;a tendency to lap a question in
turgid emotion. The man who consigns all native
races to perdition in round terms, and declares that the
only solution of the difficulty is to clear out the Kaffir,
is as truly a votary of Exeter Hall as the gentle old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
lady to whom the aborigine is a model of primeval
innocence, whose only joy is the singing of missionary
hymns.</p>

<p>Out of the confusion of interests and issues two
main problems emerge which may form useful guides
in our inquiry. One is economic. What part are the
native races to play in the labour-supply and the production
of South Africa? what is to be their tenure of
land? what is to be their economic destiny in face of
the competition of modern life and the industrial
development of the country? The second is the moral
question, of which the political is one aspect. A
coloured race living side by side with a white people
furnishes one of the gravest of moral cruces. The
existence of a subject race on whatever terms is apt to
lead to the deterioration in moral and mental vigour
of its masters. Perpetual tutelage tends to this
result; full social and civic rights, on the other hand,
lead to political anomalies and, too often, to the lowest
forms of political chicanery. A doctrinaire idealism is
fraught with dire social evils; but an obstinate maintenance
of the &ldquo;practical man&rsquo;s&rdquo; <i>status quo</i> is apt to
bring about that very degeneration which justifies the
doctrinaire. How to reconcile freedom of development
for the native by means of spontaneous labour, education,
and social rights with the degree of compulsion
necessary to bring them into line with social and
industrial needs, or, to put it shortly, how to keep the
white man from deterioration without spoiling the
Kaffir,&mdash;this is the kernel of the most insistent of
South African problems.</p>

<p>The native races south of the Zambesi present a
curious problem to the student of primitive societies.
All, or nearly all, of kindred race, they are not autochthonous,
and the date of their arrival in the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
can in most cases be fixed within the last five
centuries. Five centuries do not give a long title
to a country, as savage titles go, but even this period
must be cut down in most cases, since the wars
of the great Zulu kings scattered the other races
about as from a pepper-box, with the result that
few tribes save the Zulus, some of the Cape Colony
Kaffirs, the Swazis, and small peoples like the Barolongs,
can claim an occupation title of more than a
hundred years. This state of affairs, so rare in our
dealings with savage peoples, has, politically, both
merits and defects. The absence of the autochthonous
hold of the soil and of long-settled immovable traditions
of tribal life makes the native more malleable
under the forces of civilisation. It is easier to break
up the tribes and to acclimatise the Kaffir to new
localities and new conditions. But this lack of a
strong, settled, racial life makes it fatally easy for him
to fall a victim to the vices of civilisation, and to come
upon our hands as a derelict creature without faith or
stamina, having lost his old taboos, and being as yet
unable to understand the laws of the white man.
This process of disintegration has been going on for a
century, and the result is a clearly marked division.
We have the tribal natives, who are still more or less
strictly under the rule of a chief, and subject to tribal
laws sanctioned and enforced by the Governments.
The native population of the Transkeian territories in
Cape Colony, such as the Pondos, the Amaxosas, and
the Tembus; Bechuanaland, with the people of
Khama, Bathoen, Sebele, and Linchwe; Basutoland;
Zululand; the northern and eastern parts of the
Transvaal under such chiefs as Magata, &rsquo;Mpefu, and
Siwasa; Swaziland; and the Matabele and Mashona
tribes of the vast districts of Northern and Southern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Rhodesia are the main instances of this first class.
The aim of the different Governments has always been
to keep the tribal organisation intact, and, after eliminating
certain tribal laws and customs which are
inconsistent with the ideas of white men, to give their
sanction to the remainder. Basutoland is a Crown
colony; the Transkeian territories are a native
reserve; Bechuanaland is a native protectorate; in
Rhodesia a number of native chiefs control large tracts
of land under the Chartered Company&rsquo;s administration.
Elsewhere the tribes live in Government
reserves, or in certain cases in locations situated on
private land. Between Pretoria and the Limpopo
there are dozens of small chieftains and chieftainesses,
with tribes varying in numbers from a hundred to
several thousands. The second class, the detribalised
natives, are to be found scattered over the whole
country, notably in the western province of Cape
Colony, and in the vicinity of all South African towns.
They live as a rule in locations under municipal
or Government supervision. In many cases such
locations are far larger than those of a small chief;
but their distinguishing feature is that they are
governed solely by the law of the country or by
municipal regulations framed for the purpose, and owe
no allegiance to any chief or tribal system.</p>

<p>It is obvious that for purposes of policy this distinction
cannot maintain its importance. The rule
of the chief is being rapidly undermined by natural
causes, and no taking thought can bolster it up for
ever. Education, too, and the closer settlement of the
country by white men, are rapidly breaking down
tribal customs and beliefs, which, as a rule, have more
vitality than the isolated sentiment of allegiance. For
us the real distinction is between the natives who can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
be kept in large reserves or locations, whether tribal
or otherwise, and the floating native population, which
is every day growing in numbers. Sooner or later
we must face the problem of the overcrowding of all
reserves, and the consequent efflux of homeless and
masterless men. The needs of progress, too, are daily
tending to change the tribal native into the isolated
native attached to some industry or other. Politically
the question is, How far and on what lines the large
reserves and locations can be best maintained, and
what provision can be made for incorporating the
overflow, which exists now and will soon exist in far
greater numbers, on sane and rational lines in the
body politic?</p>

<p class="smlpadt">Such being the main requirements of the problem,
it remains to consider the forms in which they present
themselves to the ordinary man. For the working
aspect of a question is generally very different from
the form it takes in an academic analysis. The translation
into the terms of everyday life is conditioned by
many accidental causes, so that to one section of the
community the labour problem is the sole one, to
another the educational, to a third the social. It is
important to realise that all are part of one question,
and that no single one can be truly solved unless
the whole is dealt with. This incompleteness of
view, more than any other cause, has complicated
the native question, and produced spurious antagonisms,
and policies which are apparently rival, but
in reality are complementary.</p>

<p>The first is the grave difficulty which must always
attend the existence of a subject race. Slavery is the
extreme form of the situation, and in it we see the
evils and dangers on a colossal scale. A subject population,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
to whom legal rights are denied, tends in the
long-run to degrade the value of human life, and to
depreciate the moral currency,&mdash;a result so deadly
for true progress that the consensus of civilised races
has utterly condemned it. The denial of social and
political rights is almost equally dangerous, since,
apart from the risks of perpetual tutelage in a progressive
community, there follows necessarily a depreciation
of those political truths upon which all free
societies are based. Many honest men have clearly
perceived this; but after the fashion of headstrong
honesty, they have confused the issues by an inaccurate
use of words. Legal rights must be granted,
and since the law is the child of the fundamental
principles of human justice, legal equality should follow.
Social and political rights also must be given; but
why social and political equality? The most embittered
employer of native labour does not deny that
the black man should share certain social privileges,
and be made to feel his place in the political organism,
but he rightly denies that rights mean equality of
rights; while his doctrinaire opponent, arguing from
exactly the same premises, claims a foolish equality on
a misunderstanding of words. The essence of social
and political equality must be a standard of education
and moral and intellectual equipment, which can be
roughly attributed to all members of the community
concerned. But in this case there can be no such
common standard. Between the most ignorant white
man and the black man there is fixed for the present
an impassable gulf, not of colour but of mind. The
native is often quick of understanding, industrious,
curiously logical, but he lives and moves in a mental
world incredibly distant from ours. The medium of
his thought, so to speak, is so unique that the results
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
are out of all relation to ourselves. Mentally he is as
crude and naove as a child, with a child&rsquo;s curiosity
and ingenuity, and a child&rsquo;s practical inconsequence.
Morally he has none of the traditions of self-discipline
and order, which are implicit, though often in a degraded
form, in white people. In a word, he cannot
be depended upon as an individual save under fairly
vigilant restraint; and in the mass he forms an unknown
quantity, compared with which a Paris mob
is a Quaker meeting. With all his merits, this
instability of character and intellectual childishness
make him politically far more impossible than even
the lowest class of Europeans. High property or
educational qualifications for the franchise, or any other
of the expedients of Europe, are logically out of place,
though they were raised to the possession of a fortune
and a university degree; for the mind is still there,
unaltered, though it may be superficially ornamented.
Give the native the full franchise, argues one class of
observer, and he will in time show himself worthy of
it, for in itself it is an education. On a strictly logical
view it would be as reasonable to put a child on
a steam-engine as driver, trusting that the responsibility
of his position would be in itself an education
and would teach him the necessary art.</p>

<p>Social and political equality will seem to most men
familiar with the subject a chimera, but social and
political rights the native must have, and in most
cases has already obtained. But unless such rights
are carefully adjusted the absolute cleavage remains.
We have two races, physically different, socially
incapable of amalgamation: if we make the gulf
final, there is no possibility of a united state; if
we bridge it carelessly, the possibility is still more
distant. We may scruple to grant rights, such as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
the political franchise, which are based in the last
resort on a common moral and intellectual standard;
but we can grant rights which are substantive and
educative and capable of judicious extension. The
Glen Grey Act, as we shall see, made a valuable
experiment in securing to the native the social
status which attends individual tenure of land.
Some form of representation might be devised, by
which a chief might have a voice on a district
council, or a representative elected by an industrial
location assist in local government. Such measures,
joined with a rational system of education, will leave
the door open for the extension of rights till such
time as the native has finally shown whether he is
worthy of equality or condemned by nature to rank
for ever as a subject race. There are men, able
men with the courage of their opinions, who see no
hope in the matter, and who would segregate the
natives in a separate territory under British protection.
The chief objection to this policy is that it
is impossible. The native is in our midst, and we
must face the facts. We have a chance to solve
a burning question which no other nation has had,
since, as in the United States, the matter has either
been complicated by initial slavery, or, as also in
the States, a thoughtless plunge has been made
into European doctrines of liberty, equality, and
fraternity. If we patiently and skilfully bring to
bear upon the black man the solvent and formative
influences of civilisation, one of two things must
happen. Either the native will prove himself worthy
of an equal share in the body politic; or, the experiment
having been honestly tried, he will sink
back to his old place and gradually go the way of
the Red Indian and the Hottentot. For it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
inevitable that civilisation, if wisely applied, must
either raise him or choke him,&mdash;raise him to the
rank of equal citizenship, or, by its hostility to his
ineradicable qualities, prove a burden too heavy to
support.</p>

<p>The second is the ever-recurring problem of labour.
In an earlier chapter the economic aspect of the
question has been discussed; for the present we
have to face that aspect which is connected with
a native policy. The Kaffir is fundamentally an
agriculturist, and when his lands are well situated
he reaps enough for his simple existence with a
minimum of labour. If he is rich enough to have
several wives, they do the necessary picking and
hoeing, and their lord and master sits in the shade
of his hut and eats the bread of idleness. This was
well enough in the old hunting and fighting days,
when the male folk lived a strenuous life in the
pursuit of game and the slaughter of their neighbours.
But with civilisation close to their gates,
the old system means a degraded somnolent life
for the man, and the continuance of a real, though
not necessarily unpleasant, form of slavery for the
woman. And this in a country which is crying
aloud for labour and development! To be sure, the
foregoing is not a complete picture of all Kaffir life,
but it is true of the larger reserves and the wealthier
kraals. To most men it is an offence that the native,
who is saved by British power from insecurity of
life and limb, should be allowed to remain, by the
happy accident of nature, an idler dependent only
on the kindness of mother earth, multiplying his
kind at an alarming rate, and untouched by the
industrial struggle where his sinews are so sorely
needed. The Kaffir owes his existence to the white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
man; in return he should be compelled to labour
for hire and take his proper place in a world which
has no room for his vegetating habits. He holds
his land by our favour, he is protected from extinction
by our arms, he enjoys the benefits of our laws;
and he must pay for it all, not only in taxes but
by a particular tax, a certain quantity of labour.
This mode of argument sounds so serenely reasonable
that one is apt to miss the very dangerous
political doctrine which underlies it. Stated shortly,
it runs thus. Compulsory labour without payment
is to be reprobated like all forms of <i>corvie</i>, but if
we pay what we regard as a fair price and make
the compulsion indirect, then we get rid of such an
objection. This doctrine involves two principles which
seem to me to be subversive of all social order, and
in particular of that civilisation which they profess
to support. The Kaffir would be placed outside the
play of economic forces. His wages would be arbitrarily
established on an artificial basis, unalterable
save at the will of his white masters. In the second
place, compulsion by high taxation is not indirect
compulsion, but one of the most direct forms of
coercion known to history. To constrain a man
indirectly is to use unseen forces and half-understood
conditions which, being unrealised, do not
impair his consciousness of liberty; but this is not
the method which is proposed. A white man, it is
argued, suffers want if he does not work. Well and
good,&mdash;so does the Kaffir; but the work which he
does, unless he is rich enough to have it vicariously
performed, is different in kind from the work which
others want him to do, and hence the trouble arises.
To force a man, black or white, to enter on labour
for which he is disinclined, is to rank him with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
beasts of burden, and prevent him, as an industrial
creature, from ever attaining the conscious freedom
which labour bestows. The old truth, so often misapplied,
that a man who does not work shall not
eat, is a statement of economic conditions to which
those who quote it in this connection would seek
to do violence.</p>

<p>But such truisms do not exhaust the question. It
is not the Kaffir who chiefly matters, for in his
present stage of development he might be as well
off one way as another; it is the white man&rsquo;s interests
which must decide. If the whole of Kaffirdom
were sunk in a state of feminine slavery and
male indolence, violence might be done to political
axioms with some show of reason; but the Kaffir
is emerging from his savagery and has shown in
more ways than one a capacity for industrial development.
But, taking the Kaffir on the lowest plane,
what is to be the effect on the white population of
South Africa if forced labour is to stereotype for
ever a lower race, to which the free selection of
labour, the first requisite of progress, is denied?
&ldquo;The safety of the commonwealth,&rdquo; wrote John
Mackenzie, &ldquo;absolutely demands that no hatches be
battened down over the heads of any part of the
community.&rdquo; At the back of all the many excellent
cases which have been made out for compulsory
labour by high taxation, there lie the immediate
needs of the great gold industry&mdash;needs which it is
now clear can never be met in South Africa alone by
any native legislation. An instant industrial demand
is apt to blind many good men for the moment to
those wider truths, which on other occasions they
are ready enough to assent to. The case has been
further prejudiced for most people by the bad arguments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
used on the native side, and the intolerable
cant with which obvious truths have been sicklied
over. We need not concern ourselves with the so-called
degradation of Kaffir manhood implied in
compulsory labour, for such self-conscious manhood
does not exist; but we are very deeply concerned
with the degradation of white manhood, which will
inevitably follow any of the facile solutions which
are cried in the market-place. If by violent methods
economic laws are checked in their play, a subject
race in a low state of civilisation is checked on the
only side on which development can be reasonably
looked for. The harder and lower forms of toil will
fall into Kaffir hands for good; the white population
will become an aristocracy based on a kind of slave
labour; and with the abolition of an honest hierarchy
of work, degeneration will set in with terrible swiftness.
It is a pleasing dream this, of a community of
cultivated white men above the needs of squalid or
menial toil, but on such a dream no free nation was
ever built. The old tribal system is crumbling, and
in a hundred years or less we shall see the Kaffirs
abroad in the land, closely knit to all industries
and touching social and political life at countless
points. If they are a portion, however small, of
the civic organism, there is hope for the future; but
if they are a thing apart, denied the commonest of
all rights, and remaining in their present crude and
stagnant condition, they will be a menace, political
and moral, which no one can contemplate with
equanimity. There are, indeed, only two entirely
logical policies towards the native. Either remove
him, bag and baggage, to some Central African
reserve and leave him to fight his wars and live as
he lived before the days of Tchaka, or bring him into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
close and organic relation with those forces of a high
civilisation which must inevitably mend or end him.</p>

<p>There is a third chief aspect in which the native
problem presents itself to the ordinary man. The
Kaffir, south of the Zambesi, already outnumbers the
white man by fully five to one, and he increases with
at least twice the rapidity. Most native reserves and
locations are overcrowded, the Kaffir is being driven
on to private land as an unauthorised squatter, and
the floating population in and around the towns is
daily increasing. What is to be the end of this
fecundity? Living on little, subject apparently to
none of the natural or prudential checks on over-population,
there seems a real danger of black ultimately
swamping white by mere gross quantity. In any
case there will soon be a grave economic crisis, for,
unless prompt measures are adopted, a large loose
vagabondage will grow up all over the land. It is
to be noted that this danger is the converse of the
two problems we have already discussed. They referred
to the stereotyping of the Kaffir races as a
settled agricultural people out of line with industrial
progress; this concerns the inevitable break-up of
the old agricultural condition by mere excess of
population and the difficulty of dealing with the
overflow. This complementary character which the
problems assume is one of the most hopeful features
of the case. Natural forces are bringing the Kaffir to
our hands. The <i>dibbcle</i> of his old life is turning him
upon the world to be formed and constrained at our
pleasure. The field is clear for experiment, and it
behoves us to make up our minds clearly on the forms
which the experiment must take.</p>

<p class="smlpadt">To recapitulate the results of the preceding pages.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
The central problem is how to bring the native races
under the play of civilising forces, so that they
may either approve themselves as capable of incorporation
in the body politic, or show themselves
eternally incapable, in which case history would lead
us to believe that they will gradually disappear. To
effect this vital experiment, no rigid economic or
social barrier should be placed between them and the
white inhabitants. Since the old tribal organisation
is breaking up, the ground is being rapidly prepared
for the trial. It is our business, therefore, to consider
how best the system of tribes and reserves can
be maintained, so long as there is in it the stuff of
life, and what new elements can be introduced which
will make its fall more safe and gradual; and, in the
second place, to devise ways and means for dealing
with the rapidly increasing loose native population,
for replacing the former tribal traditions with some
rudiments of civilised law, and for leaving an open
door for such development as may be within their
capacity. It will be convenient to look at ways and
means under three heads. There is, first, the general
question of taxation, which is common to all. There
is, secondly, the problem of the larger reserves, and
the maintenance, so far as is desirable, of the old
rural life, with the kindred questions of land tenure,
of local government, of surplus population, and of
labour. And, finally, there is the problem of the class
which in the last resort is destined to be most numerous,
the wholly non-tribal and unattached natives,
whose mode of life must be created afresh and controlled
by Government. This is the most difficult
problem, since such natives are peculiarly exposed to
the solvents of white civilisation, and everything depends
upon the method in which the solvents are used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
The native is, for the most part, under special
taxes. In certain parts of Cape Colony and Natal
the fiscal system is in practice the same for black and
white, but for the purposes of this inquiry the native
who has adopted the white man&rsquo;s life may be disregarded.
In Cape Colony the hut tax is 10s. per
annum, whether the hut is situated on private or
Crown lands, and on locations within municipalities a
similar municipal tax is paid. In Natal the hut tax
is 14s., in Basutoland #1, in Rhodesia 10s., and in the
Transvaal and Orange River Colony 10s. under the
old <i>rigime</i>. In Natal, the Orange River Colony, the
Transvaal, and Rhodesia, there was also a native pass
law, under which certain sums were charged on travelling
passes, varying from 6d. in the Orange River
Colony to 2s. per month in the mining areas of the
Transvaal. It is unnecessary to go into the numerous
details of native taxation, which within narrow
limits are constantly varied, but it is worth while to
look at two instances which may be taken as the extreme
types of such taxation, the Transvaal under the
former Government and the districts of Cape Colony
subject to the Glen Grey Act. In the Transvaal the
natives for the most part are tribal, and the system
of taxation was based on tribal considerations; but
the bulk of the revenue under the Pass Law came
from the large fluctuating population of natives at
work on the mines. Under the old Government the
ordinary native paid 10s. as hut tax, #2 as capitation
fee, with sundry other charges for passes, &amp;c., which
brought the whole amount which might be levied up
to fully #4. The tax was loosely collected, but on the
whole the taxation per head was reasonably high.
One of the first acts of the new administration was
to consolidate all native taxes in one general poll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
tax of #2, with a further charge of #2 per wife for
natives who had more than one. The pass fee was
also charged upon the employer in districts where it
fell to be levied. The net result, therefore, is that for
a native, who is the husband of not more than one
wife, the sum payable yearly is about #3, made up
of the poll tax and the registration fee. A native
may have to pay more than the old Government
exacted, but if he pleases he can pay less. In the
districts under the Glen Grey Act individual ownership
of land is encouraged, and the native who has
attained to such tenure is practically in the position
of a white citizen&mdash;that is, he pays no hut tax or poll
tax, and his contributions to revenue consist in the
payment of such rates as his district council or the
Transkeian General Council may levy. For the
native who holds no land either on quit-rent or freehold
title, there is a labour tax of 10s. per annum,
which he can avoid by showing that he has been at
work outside the district for a period of three months
during the previous year, and from which he can gain
complete exemption by showing that at some time he
has worked for a total period of three years. Such
a tax is not a compulsory labour tax, but should
rather be regarded as a modification of the hut tax,
which can be remitted as a bonus on outside labour.</p>

<p>The contrast between the two forms of taxation is
obvious, the one being a special and peculiar type,
the other a modification of the general fiscal system
of the colony. It is to the latter type that all
systems of native taxation must tend to approximate.
There are certain obvious objections to the hut tax,
of which the chief is that it leads to overcrowding
and bad sanitation, and prevents young men from
building huts of their own; and perhaps it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
be well if, following the new Transvaal precedent,
all native taxes were consolidated into one comprehensive
poll tax. But, speaking generally, natives
are not heavily taxed<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a
href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> having regard to their wage-
earning
capacity, though hitherto the Customs have
been unduly hard upon their simple commodities.
In the Transvaal, for example, there is little doubt
that the native population could bear for revenue
purposes in most years a poll tax of #3 per head.
This might be reduced in case of natives in industrial
employment, in consideration of the fact that such
natives contribute otherwise to revenue through the
Pass Law. It is one of the ironies of this South
African problem that increased and reasonable taxation
for revenue purposes will continue to be identified
in many minds with compulsory labour through
high taxation. The two things are as wide apart as
the poles. The native, in return for protection and
good government, is required to pay a certain sum per
annum calculated solely on fiscal needs and his earning
capacity. That is the only basis of native taxation;
but when the sum has been fixed, it may be expedient
as a matter of policy to reduce the tax in the case of
natives working under an employer, partly because
such natives contribute to the Exchequer in another
way, and partly as a bonus to encourage outside
labour. But the general form of taxation might
well be altered, slowly and cautiously, as the time
ripened. The hut tax might be gradually transmuted
into a form of rent which, as in the Glen Grey
districts, could be lowered as a bonus on outside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
labour, and the extension of local government might
provide for the rating of locations and reserves on
some system common to all districts. Taxation may
have an educative force, and to ask from the native
a contribution for something of which the purpose is
apparent and the justification obvious, is to bestow on
him a kind of freedom. It is the first step to taxation
with representation to provide that taxation should
be accompanied by understanding.</p>

<p class="smlpadt">The second question is that of existing reserves and
the possibility and method of their maintenance. In
the case of many the problem is still simple. Basutoland,
the chief tribes of the Bechuanaland Protectorate
and Southern Rhodesia, Swaziland, Zululand, the races
of the north and north-eastern Transvaal, and a considerable
part of the Transkeian territories, will find
for many years protected tribal government suitable
to their needs. Tribal customs and laws, in so far as
they are not <i>contra bonos mores</i>, are recognised by the
protecting Governments, and given effect to by any
white courts which may have jurisdiction in the district.
The old modes of land tenure, the succession
to the chieftainship, the tribal religion, if any exists,
should be given the sanction of the sovereign Power
till such time as they crumble from their own baselessness.
The disintegrating forces are many and
potent. Taxation will compel the acquisition of
wealth other than in kind, and will therefore
strengthen existing trade, and, if gradually modified
in character till it approach a rating system,
will replace the tribe by the district as a local unit.
The growth of population will compel a certain overflow,
which must either be accommodated on new
land under special conditions, or must go to swell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
the general industrial community. Education, the
greatest of all disintegrators, is loosening slowly the
old ties, and is increasing the wants of the native
by enlarging his mental horizon. Outside labour,
whether undertaken from love of novelty or from
sheer economic pressure, leaves its indelible mark
on the labourer. The Kaffir who has worked for
two years in Kimberley or Johannesburg may seem
to have returned completely to his old stagnant life,
but there is a new element at work in him and his
kindred, a new curiosity, a weakening of his regard
for his traditional system. Agriculture itself, which
has hitherto been the mainstay of his conservatism, is
rapidly becoming a force of revolution. Formerly no
self-respecting native would engage in cultivation,
leaving such tasks to his women; but a native who
would not touch pick or hoe is ready enough to work
a plough, if he is so fortunate as to possess one. The
growth of wealth and a spirit of enterprise among the
tribes leads to improved tillage, and once the native
is content to labour himself in the fields, his old scheme
of society is already crumbling.</p>

<p>But, in addition to natural solvents, there is one
which we might well apply in our own interest
against the time when the tribal system shall have
finally disappeared. Any form of political franchise,
however safeguarded, is in my opinion illogical and
dangerous. It is inequitable to create barriers which
are themselves artificial, but it is both inequitable
and impolitic to disregard natural barriers when the
basis of our politics is a presumed natural equality.
But it may be possible to admit the Kaffir to a share
in self-government without giving any adherence to
the doctrine involved in a grant of a national franchise.
Local government is still in its infancy all over South
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Africa, but the common type is some form of urban
or district council. The questions which such councils
discuss do not involve high considerations of statescraft,
but simple practical matters, such as roads and
bridges, sanitary restrictions, precautions against stock
diseases, and market rules. Supposing that in any
district there exists a tribe or a location sufficiently
progressive and orderly, I see no real difficulty in
bringing the chief or induna sooner or later directly
or indirectly into the local council. It is a matter on
which it is idle to dogmatise, being one of the many
questions on which South Africa must say the last
word, and being further dependent on the status
of the natives in each district; but on a nominated
or elective council a native, or a white member with
natives in his constituency, might do valuable work in
assisting with matters in which natives were largely
concerned. A native who cannot reasonably be asked
to decide on questions such as fiscal reform or military
organisation, may be very well fitted to advise, as
a large stock-holder, on precautionary measures
against rinderpest. If such a step is ever taken&mdash;and
the present exclusive attitude of South Africa
is rather a sign of the growing solidarity of the
community than an index of a permanent conviction&mdash;an
advance of enormous import will have been
made in that branch of native education in which we
are almost powerless to move directly, namely, his
training as a responsible citizen.</p>

<p>As the tribal system breaks down from whatever
cause, the tribesmen must do one of three things&mdash;either
settle on the land on new conditions, or live
permanently in the service of employers, or swell the
loose population of town and country. The second
course does not concern us, being a matter for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
private law of master and servant. But in each
of the other courses the State is profoundly interested.
For the sake of the future it is necessary to have
the existing reserves thoroughly examined, for, since
the fluctuations of native populations are very great,
many are too small for their present occupants and a
few are too spacious. Majajie&rsquo;s location in Zoutpansberg,
and one or two of the reserves on the western
border of the Transvaal, may be quoted as instances
of tribes which have shrunk from the original number
on which the grant of land was based. In such cases
the land might reasonably be curtailed, since it is still
Crown land held in trust for the natives&rsquo; use, and not
private land purchased by the chiefs themselves. But
it is more usual to find locations far too narrow, and
the result in many parts is that a certain number of
natives who have been compelled to leave their old
reserves are farming private lands on precarious and
burdensome terms, or are squatting on Crown lands
with no legal tenure at all. A law of the late
Transvaal Government (No. 21 of 1895) made it
illegal to have more than five native households on
one private farm; but this law, like many others
which conflicted with the interests of the governing
class, was quietly allowed to become a dead letter.
There are men to-day who have a hundred and more
native families on a farm, paying often exorbitant
rents either in money or in forced labour, and liable
to be turned adrift at a moment&rsquo;s notice. The old
Boer system was to allow natives to squat on land in
return for six months&rsquo; labour; but this mode of payment
is never satisfactory with a Kaffir, who soon
forgets the tenure on which he holds his land, regards
it as his own, and makes every attempt to evade his
tenant&rsquo;s service. The whole position is unsatisfactory,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
the master being cumbered with unwilling and often
worthless labour, the tenant subject to a capricious
rent and a permanent possibility of eviction. In the
interests of both white and black it is desirable to
end this anomaly. Some form of the Squatters&rsquo; Law
might be re-enacted and enforced, a farmer being
allowed a reasonable number of native families, who
give work for wages and pay a fair rent for their land.
The balance might well be accommodated as tenants on
such portions of Crown land as are suitable for Kaffirs
and incapable of successful white settlement. Such
lands exist in the parts where the native population is
densest, as in the northern and eastern districts of
the Transvaal. The situation affords an opportunity
for the Government policy towards outside labour.
If the rent per holding were fixed at some figure like
#10 (which is less than many natives pay to private
owners) it might be reduced to #5, if a certain proportion
of the males of a household went out to labour
for a part of the year in the towns or in some rural
employment other than farming. Such a policy would
give immediate relief to the really serious congestion
in many districts, would establish a better system of
native tenure, and would pave the way for a closer
connection between the industrial native and the
country kraal.</p>

<p class="smlpadt">The wholly detribalised native is a more important
problem, because he represents the type of what the
Kaffir will in some remote future become&mdash;a man who
has forgotten his race traditions, and has become an
unpopular attachi of the white community. Towards
other natives our policy must be only to maintain an
amended <i>status quo</i>, but for him we must make an
effort at construction. It is no business of mine to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
frame policies, but only to sketch, roughly and imperfectly,
the conditions of the problem which the constructive
statesman (and South Africa will long have
need of constructive statesmen) must face. Individual
tenure of land&mdash;and by this is not necessarily meant
freehold, even under the Glen Grey restrictions as to
alienation, for a long lease may be more politic and
equally attractive<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a
href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>&mdash;and the spread of
education and
commerce will work to the same effect in the rural
districts as industrial employment in the towns. But
for the present the towns furnish the gravest problem&mdash;how
to make adequate provision for the increasing
native population, which is neither living permanently
in the households of white masters nor working in
the mines under a time contract. It is desirable to
have locations for natives, as it is fitting to provide
bazaars for Asiatics, since the native should be concentrated
both for administrative and educational
purposes. Those municipal locations, which already
exist in many towns, will have to be taken vigorously
in hand. Something must replace the biscuit-tin
shanties where the native, ignorant of sanitation,
lives, under more wretched conditions, what is practically
the life of a country kraal, and with the reform
of their habitations a new attraction to industry will
exist for the better class of Kaffir. It is a common
mistake to class all natives together, a mistake which
a little knowledge of South African ethnology and
history would prevent. Many have highly developed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
instincts of cleanliness, and much race pride, and will
not endure to be huddled in squalid locations with
the refuse of inferior tribes. Given decent dwelling-places,
education on rational lines, and after a time,
perhaps, a share in municipal government, might lay
the foundation of a civic life and an industrial usefulness
far more lasting than can be expected from
casual labourers brought from distant homes for a
few months&rsquo; work, and carried back again.</p>

<p>South Africa has in her day possessed one man who
desired to look at things as they are, a murky and
distorted genius at times, but at his best inspired
with something of a prophet&rsquo;s insight. The fruit of
Mr Rhodes&rsquo; native administration was the Glen Grey
Act, which still remains the only attempt at a constructive
native policy. It is hard enough to govern,
but sometimes, looking to the iron necessities in the
womb of time, it is wise to essay a harder task, and
build. We must keep open our communications with
the future, and begin by recognising the fundamental
truths, which are apt to get a little dimmed by the
dust of the political arena. The first is that the
native is psychologically a child, and must be treated
as such; that is, he is in need of a stricter discipline
and a more paternal government than the white man.
South Africa has already recognised this by the
remarkable consensus of opinion which she has shown
in the prohibition of the sale of intoxicants to coloured
people. He is as incapable of complete liberty as
he is undeserving of an unintelligent censure. The
second is that he is with us, a permanent factor which
must be reckoned with, in spite of the advocates of a
crude Bismarckian policy; and because his fortunes
are irrevocably linked to ours, it is only provident to
take care that the partnership does not tend to our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
moral and political disadvantage. For there is always
in the distance a grim alternative of over-population
resulting in pauperism and anarchy, or a hard despotism
producing the moral effects which the conscience
of the world has long ago in slave systems diagnosed
and condemned. There are three forces already at
work which, if judiciously fostered, will achieve the
experiment which South Africa is bound to make, and
either raise the Kaffir to some form of decent citizenship,
or prove to all time that he is incapable of true
progress. Since we are destroying the old life, with
its moral and social codes and its checks upon economic
disaster, we are bound to provide an honest substitute.
The forces referred to are those of a modified self-government,
of labour, and of an enlightened education.
The first is an experiment which must be
undertaken very carefully, unless our case is to be
prejudiced from the outset. I have given reasons for
the view that a political franchise for the native is
logically unjustifiable; but on district councils and
within municipal areas the native, wherever he is
living under conditions of tolerable decency and
comfort, might well play a part in his own control.
It may be doomed to failure or it may be the
beginning of political education, but it is an experiment
we can scarcely fail to make. In labour, short
of a crude compulsion, every means must be used to
bring the Kaffir within the industrial circle. We shall
be assisted in our task by many secret forces, but it
should be our business so to frame our future native
legislation as to place a bonus on labour outside the
kraal. The matter is so intimately bound up with
the wellbeing of the whole population that there is
less fear of neglect than of undue and capricious
haste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
A word remains to be said on native education. In
this province there is much need of effective Government
control, since in the past the energies of
educationalists have tended to flow in mistaken
channels or be dissipated over too wide an area.
The native is apt to learn in a kind of parrot
fashion, and this aptitude has misled many who have
devoted their lives to his interests. But in the
present state of his culture what we are used to
call the &ldquo;humanities&rdquo; have little educational importance.
At the best the result is to turn out native
pastors and schoolmasters in undue numbers, unfortunate
men who have no proper professional field
and no footing in the society to which their education
might entitle them. It is a truth which the wiser
sort of missionaries all over the world are now recognising
in connection with the propagation of Christianity&mdash;that
the ground must be slowly prepared
before the materialist savage mind can be familiarised
with the truths of a spiritual religion. Otherwise
the result is a glib confession of faith which ends in
scandal. The case is the same with what we call
&ldquo;secondary education.&rdquo; The teaching of natives, if
it is to produce any practical good, should, to begin
with, be confined to the elements and to technical
instruction. The native mind is very ready to learn
anything which can be taught by concrete instances,
and most forms of manual dexterity, even some of the
more highly skilled, come as easily to him as to the
white man. When the boys are taught everywhere
carpentry and ironwork and the rudiments of trade,
and the girls sewing and basket-making and domestic
employments, a far more potent influence will have
been introduced than the Latin grammar or the
primer of history. The wisest missionary I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
ever met had a station which was a kind of ideal
city for order and industry, with carpenters&rsquo; and
blacksmiths&rsquo; shops, a model farm, basket-making,
orchards, and dairies. &ldquo;By these means,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I am teaching my children the elements of religion,
which are honesty, cleanliness, and discipline.&rdquo; &ldquo;And
dogma?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as to dogma,
I think we must be content for the present with a
few stories and hymns.&rdquo;</p>

It is proposed to assimilate native taxation in Southern Rhodesia to
the system now in vogue in the Transvaal, and impose a poll tax of #2,
with a tax of 10s. for each extra wife. In the Orange River Colony it is
proposed to raise the hut tax to #1.</p>

The question of native ownership of land in the new colonies is not
very clear. In the Transvaal land was generally held in trust for natives
by the Native Commissioners; but apparently half-castes could own
land, and Asiatics under certain restrictions. In the Orange River
Colony ownership by Asiatics is forbidden; but certain native tribes,
such as the Barolongs in Maroka, and the Oppermans at Jacobsdaal,
as well as half-castes and the people known as the Bastards, were
allowed freehold titles, subject to certain restrictions on alienation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<h4>JOHANNESBURG.</h4>

<p>It is a delicate matter to indulge in platitudes about a
city. For a city is an organism more self-conscious
than a state, and a personality less robust than an
individual. Comments which, if made on a nation,
would be ignored, and on an individual would be
tolerated, awaken angry reprisals when directed to a
municipal area. The business is still more delicate
when the city concerned is not yet quite sure of
herself. Johannesburg is a city, though she has no
cathedral to support the conventional definition, or
royal warrant to give her dignitaries precedence;
but she is a city still on trial, sensitive, ambitious,
profoundly ignorant of her own mind. Her past
has been short and checkered. She has done many
things badly and many things well; she has been
the target for universal abuse, and still with one
political party fills the honourable post of whipping-boy
in chief to the Empire. Small wonder if her
people are a little dazed&mdash;proud of themselves,
hopeful of her future, but far from clear what this
future is to be.</p>

<p>At first sight she has nothing to commend her.
The traveller who drags his stiff limbs from the Cape
mail sees before him a dusty road, some tin-roofed
shanties, with a few large new jerry buildings humped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
above them: a number of straggling dusty pines and
gums, a bit of bare hillside in the distance, and a few
attenuated mine chimneys. Everything is new, raw,
and fortuitous, as uncivilised and certainly as ugly as
the desert ridge on which an old Bezuidenhout planted
his homestead. The chief streets do not efface the
first impression. Some buildings are good, but the
general effect is mean. The place looks as if it had
sprung up, like some Western township, in a night,
and as if the original builders had been in such a
desperate hurry to get done with it that they could
not stop to see that one house kept line with its
neighbours. It is a common South African defect,
but there is here no <i>mise-en-schne</i> to relieve the ugliness.
Looking at Pretoria from the hills one sees a
forest of trees, with white towers and walls rising
above the green. The walls may be lath and plaster,
but the general effect is as pretty as the eye could
wish. For Johannesburg there is no such salvation.
Looked at from one of her many hills, the meanness
and irregularity are painfully clear. She has far more
trees than Pretoria, but she is so long and sprawling
that the bare ribs have pushed aside their covering.
An extended brickfield is the first impression: a prosperous
powder-factory is the last.</p>

<p>Yet in her way she has many singular beauties.
Doubtless in time to come she will be so great that
she will contain more cities than one in her precincts,
and there may well be a residential quarter as fine
as any in Europe. The Rand is a long shallow
basin with hilly rims, within which lie the mines and
the working city. The southern rim shelves away
into featureless veld, but the northern sinks sharply
on a plain, across forty miles of which rise the gaunt
lines of the Magaliesberg. What fashionable suburb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
has a vista of forty miles of wild country, with a
mountain wall on the horizon? Below on the flats
there are many miles of pine woods, valleys and
streams and homesteads, and the Pretoria road making
a bold trail over a hill. In winter the horizon is lit
with veld-fires; in summer and spring there are the
wild sunsets of the veld and soft mulberry gloamings.
The slope behind shuts out the town and the mine
chimneys, and yet the whole place is not three miles
from Market Square. Whatever happens, nothing
can harm the lucky dwellers on the ridge. Though
the city creep ten miles into the plain beneath, there
is still ample prospect; and not all the fumes from all
the industries on earth can spoil the sharp vigour of
the winds blowing clean from the wilds.</p>

<p>But the place has not yet found itself. The city
proper is still for the future; for the present we have
a people. What the real conception, current in England,
of this people may be it is not easy to tell, the
whole matter having been transferred to party politics,
and presented, plain or coloured, to partisan spectators.
So we are given every possible picture, from
that of Semitic adventurers nourishing the fires of life
on champagne, to that of a respectable and thoroughly
domesticated people, morbidly awake to every sentiment
of Empire. &ldquo;Judasburg,&rdquo; &ldquo;the New Jerusalem,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the Golden City,&rdquo; and a variety of other pet names,
show that to the ordinary man, both in and out of
parties, there is something bizarre and exotic about
the place. And yet no conception could be more
radically false. Johannesburg is first and foremost a
colonial city, an ordinary colonial city save for certain
qualities to be specified later. You will see more Jews
in it than in Montreal or Aberdeen, but not more than
in Paris; and any smart London restaurant will show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
as large a Semitic proportion as a Johannesburg club.
For a &ldquo;Golden City&rdquo; it is not even conspicuously
vulgar. For one fellow in large checks, diamonds,
and a pink satin tie, you will meet fifty quietly
dressed, well-mannered gentlemen. A man may still
be a beggar to-day and rich to-morrow, but less commonly
and in a different sense. The old mining-camp,
California-cum-Ballarat character of the gold industry
on the Rand has utterly passed away. Gold-mining
has ceased to be a speculation, and has become a vast
and complicated industry, employing at high salaries
the first engineering talent of the world. The prominent
mine-owner is frequently a man of education,
almost invariably a man of high ability. In few
places can you find men of such mental vigour, so
eagerly receptive of new ideas, so keenly awake to
every change of the financial and political worlds of
Europe. The blackguard alien exists, to be sure, but
he is rarely felt, and the hand of the law is heavy
upon him. That Johannesburg is made up wholly of
adventurers and Whitechapel Jews is the first piece
of cant to clear the mind of.</p>

<p>The second is the old slander that the people
think of nothing but the market, are cowardly and
selfish, indifferent to patriotism and honour. It says
little for Englishmen that they could believe this
falsehood of a place where the greater part of the
inhabitants are English. The war meant dismal
sufferings for the artisan class, who had to live in
expensive coast lodgings or comfortless camps; and it
is to the credit of Johannesburg that she stood nobly
by her refugees. The old Reform movement was not
a fortunate enterprise, but there was no lack of courage
in it; and even those who may grudge the attribute
can scarcely deny it to the same men at Elandslaagte
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
and Ladysmith. There have been various sorts of
irregular regiments&mdash;many good, some bad, one or two
the very scum of the earth; but no irregular soldiers
showed, from first to last, a more cool and persistent
courage than the men who for years had sought to
achieve by persuasion an end which required a more
summary argument. The truth is that the Johannesburger
has suffered by being contrasted, as the typical
townsman, with the Boer, as the typical countryman.
Dislike the particular countryman as we may, we have
at the back of our minds a feeling that somehow, in
George Eliot&rsquo;s phrase, an unintelligible dialect is a
guarantee for ingenuousness, and that slouching
shoulders indicate an upright disposition. It is
Johannesburg&rsquo;s misfortune that this anomalous contrast
should be forced on us. It is as if a sixteenth-century
peasant, without enterprise, without culture,
wholly un-modern and un-political, believing stoutly
in a sombre God, were living side by side with a
race of <i>intellectuels</i>, scientists, and successful merchants.
Whatever reason or, as in this case, patriotism may
say, most men have a sneaking fondness for the
peasant.</p>

<p>In every community which is worth consideration
we find two forces present in some degree&mdash;the
force of social persistence and the force of social
movement. Critics of Johannesburg would have us
believe that the second only is to be found, and in
its crudest form: the truth is that, considering the
history of the place and its novelty, the first is
remarkably strong. The point is worth labouring at
the risk of tediousness. It must be some little while
before a mining city shakes off the character of a
mining camp. Men will long choose to live uncomfortably
in hotels and boarding-houses, looking for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
their reward on their home-coming, discomfort none
the less unpleasant because it is tempered with unmeaning
luxury. To its inhabitants the place is no
continuing city,&mdash;only a camp for the adventurer, who,
when he has made the most of it, returns to enjoy the
fruits of his labour in his own place. And then, after
many years, there suddenly comes a day when a man
here and a man there realise that they have lost the
desire to return: they like the place, settle down, and
found a home. Whenever there is any fair proportion
of this class in a mining city, then we have a force of
social persistence. The tendency is found in every
class of society. At one time the miner from Wales
or Cornwall saved his earnings and returned home;
now he has his wife out and settles for good. There
is also a large commercial class, traders and small
manufacturers, who belong as thoroughly to the place
as the South African born. And with the more
educated classes the same thing is true. The price of
building sites in the suburbs and the many pretty
houses which have arisen show that even for this class,
which was most nomadic in its habits, domesticity has
become a fact.</p>

<p>This, then, is the cardinal achievement of Johannesburg,
an unparalleled achievement in so short a career.
She has in a few years changed herself from a camp
to a city, acquired a middle class and a decent artisan
class,&mdash;both slow and difficult growths,&mdash;and shown a
knack of absorbing any species of alien immigrant and
putting them on the way to respectable citizenship.
She has but to point to this solid achievement as a
final answer to the foolish calumnies of her enemies.
The mines are her staple industry, but the mines, so
far as she is concerned, are an industry and not a
speculation; and she is creating a dozen other industries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
of quite a different character, and may well
create a hundred more. She has become a municipality,
with all the traits, good and bad, of a nourishing
municipality at home. She has become colonial,
too,&mdash;as colonial, though in a different way, as Melbourne
or Wellington. Formerly she was a mixture
of every European capital plus a little of the Dutch
dorp: now she is English in essence, the most English
of all South African towns.</p>

<p>The future of the chief municipality of South Africa
cannot be without interest, for most problems will
concern her first, and receive from her their colour
and character, and, possibly, their answer. She must
continue to represent one of the two foremost interests,
and though it is idle to distinguish political
interests by their importance when both are vital, yet
we can admit that Johannesburg has for the moment
more obvious difficulties in her problems, and that her
answer will be more stormily contested. So far her
development has been continuous. The difficulties
which she met with from the Kruger <i>rigime</i> were a
blessing in disguise, being of the kind to put her on
her mettle. But the present stage in her history is
more critical. Formerly the question was whether
she was to remain a foreign cesspool or rise to the
status of an English city. Now it is whether she will
go the way of many colonial cities, and become vigorous,
dogmatic, proud, remotely English in sentiment,
consistently material in her outlook, and narrow with
the intense narrowness of those to whom politics mean
local interests spiced with rhetoric; or, as she is
already richer, more enlightened, and more famous
than her older sisters, will advance on a higher plane,
and become in the true sense an imperial city, with a
closer kinship and a more liberal culture. The question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
is a subtle and delicate one, as all questions of
spiritual development must be. A year ago much
depended on the attitude of England. Johannesburg
had suffered heavily in the war. Time and patience
were needed to repair the breaches in her fortunes,
and to permit her to advance, as she must advance, if
the Transvaal is to become a nation. She was rightly
jealous of her reputation and future prosperity. If
taxation was to be crudely imposed, if her just complaints
were to be met with the old nonsense about a
capitalists&rsquo; war, if she was to be penalised for her
most creditable industry, then there was a good prospect
of a serious estrangement. There was no issue
on the facts. She never denied her liability, and she
was willing to pay cheerfully if a little common tact
were shown in the handling. A man who may have
his hand in his pocket to repay a debt will withdraw
it if his creditor tries to collect the money with a
bludgeon. Happily the crisis has passed. A scheme
of war contribution was arranged which, while still
bearing heavily, almost too heavily, on the country in
its present transition stage, is yet a small sum if contrasted
with the lowest estimate of her assets. But
much still depends on the attitude of England. A
little sympathy, a little friendliness, a modest diminution
of newspaper taunts, some indication that the
home country sees and appreciates the difficulties of
its daughter, and is content to trust her judgment:
it is not much to ask, but its refusal will never be
forgotten or forgiven. For Johannesburg in this connection
represents the country on its most sensitive
side, and acts as a barometer of national feeling.</p>

<p>In this imperfect world there can be no development
without attendant disorders. A dead body is
never troublesome, but a growing child is prone to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
exasperate. A young city which is perfectly reasonable
and docile deserves to be regarded with deep
mistrust, for it is likely to continue in a kind of
youthful sensibility till it disappears. Ferment is a
sign of life, and the very crudeness of the ideals
which cause the ferment is a hopeful proof of vigour.
Municipalities since the beginning of time have been
the home of aspirations after self-government, however
ill-suited they may have been to rule themselves.
At this moment the Transvaal is a Crown colony,
which is to say that a mode of government devised
for subject races is being applied for a time to a
free and restless British population. The justification
is complete, but we need not be shocked when we
find Johannesburg chafing at her fetters. The less
so when we reflect that in one aspect she is a
colonial city, full of the exaggerated independence
of the self-made. The fastidiousness which comes
from culture and tradition, the humour which springs
from unshaken confidence, must necessarily be absent
in a municipality which is still diffident, still largely
uneducated. Politics must begin with the <i>schwdrmerisch</i>
and the vapid,&mdash;&ldquo;that vague barren pathos,
that useless effervescence of enthusiasm, which plunges
with the spirit of a martyr into an ocean of generalities.&rdquo;
Embryo cities are drunk with words, with
half-formed aspirations and vague ideals; wherefore
the result must be sound and fury and little meaning
till by painful stages they find themselves and see
things as they are. So far this unrest has taken
two forms&mdash;a continuous and somewhat unintelligent
criticism of the Administration, and an attempt by
means of numerous associations to give voice to
popular demands in the absence of representative
institutions; and the beginnings of a labour party.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
The first is as natural as day and night. Many grave
matters, chiefly financial, are being decided above
Johannesburg&rsquo;s head, and it is reasonable that she
should wish to state her own case. This is her
strong point: the weakness of her position is that
it is also a criticism of a reconstruction which is
still in process, still in that stage when the facts are
far more clearly perceived by the man on the watch-tower
than by the crowd in the streets below. A
pawn in a game is not the best authority on the
moves which lead to success. Patience may be a
distasteful counsel, but why should she disquiet
herself when all things in the end must be in her
hands? &ldquo;The people,&rdquo; to paraphrase a saying of
Heine, &ldquo;have time enough, they are immortal; administrators
only must pass away.&rdquo; But we cannot
complain of this critical activity, however misplaced.
It is a sign of life, and is itself the beginnings of
political education. The second form of agitation is
less reasonable and more dangerous, though perhaps
less dangerous here than anywhere else in the world.
There must exist on the Rand, in mines, railways,
and subsidiary industries, a large white industrial
population; and the imported agitator will endeavour
to organise it in accordance with his interests.
There is little theoretical justification for the movement.
There are no castes and tyrannies to fight
against in a country which is so new and self-created.
The great financial houses will not develop
into Trusts on the American model; and even
if they did, the result would have small effect on
the working man, either as labourer or consumer.
There are dozens of false pretexts. The working
man of the Rand may try, as he has tried in
Australia, to stereotype his monopoly and prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
the influx of new labour; or he may use the necessary
discomforts of a transition stage as a lever to
raise his wages; or the idle and incompetent may
grumble vaguely against a capitalism which has been
built up by their abler brothers. The pretexts are
light as air. He lives in a free society, and within
limits can secure his comfort and independence beyond
a chance of encroachment. But unhappily it does
not require a justification in reason to bring the
labour agitator into being. That type, so well
known in Australia, has already appeared, the unreasoning
obstructionist, who, armed with a few
platitudes and an entire absence of foresight, preaches
his crude gospel to a class which is already vaguely
unsettled by the intricacies of the economic problem.
There is almost certain to be an attempt to organise
labour on Australian lines, and to create a party like
the Sand Lot agitators in San Francisco, in order to
do violence to the true economic interests of the land
on behalf of a prejudice or a theory. Yet I cannot
think that there is more in the prospect than a
temporary inconvenience. No labour party can be
really formidable unless it is based on profound discontents
and radical grievances; and the annoyances
of the Johannesburg proletariat are, as compared with
those of Europe, like crumpled rose-leaves to thorns.
There is too strong a force of social persistence in
the city to suffer it ever to become the prey of a
well-organised gang of revolutionaries; and if such
a force exists, the experience of Victoria in its
great railway strike of 1903 would seem to show
that in the long-run no labour war can succeed
which tends to a wholesale disorganisation of social
and industrial life.</p>

<p>But if Johannesburg shows a certain unrest, she also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
reveals a curious solidarity&mdash;the strength of narrowness
and exclusion, which is partly natural and due to
the struggle for self-conscious existence, and partly
accidental and based on a profound disappointment.
Her citizens believed that the end of the war would
begin a golden age of unprecedented prosperity. Money
was to flow into her coffers, her population to grow by
many thousands each year, and she herself was to
stand out before an envious world as a type of virtue
rewarded. She miscalculated the future, and the facts
left her aghast. Conservative estimates, a few years
back, put the value of the gold output in 1902 at
between 20 and 30 millions: the actual figures during
the first year of peace show little over 10 millions&mdash;a
reduction on the output of 1898. Hence the almost
hysterical concentration of interest on the one great
industry. Men who in other matters are remarkable
for their breadth of view, are to be found declaring
that everything must be made subordinate to mining
development,&mdash;not in the sense in which the saying is
true, that the prosperity of the country depends in
the first instance on the mines, but in the quite indefensible
sense that any consideration of other
things, even when there is no conflict between them
and the mining interest, is a misapplication of energy
which should go to the greater problem. It is fair
to argue against a programme of public works which
might draw native labour from the mines, because,
unless we cherish the goose, there will be no golden
eggs to pay for our programmes. But to condemn
schemes of settlement which are no more a hindrance
to the gold industry than to the planetary system, is
to show a nervous blindness to graver questions, which
is the ugliest product of the present strain and confusion.
This trait, however, cannot be permanent;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
and we may look to see the gold industry in time,
when its own crisis is past, become that enlightened
force in politics which the ability of its leaders and
the weight of its organisation entitle it to be. For
the other form of narrowness, which consists in the
limitation of citizenship, there is ample justification
in present circumstances. A new city must begin
by drawing in her skirts and showing herself,
perhaps unwarrantably, jealous and sensitive. More
especially a city which has hitherto been rather
a fortuitous gathering of races than a compact
community, is right in straining after such compactness,
even at the cost of a little injustice.
The only danger lies in the perpetuation of this
attitude when its justification has gone.</p>

<p>The fault of Johannesburg, to sum up, lies for the
moment in a certain narrow hardness of view: her
hope is in the possession of rich elements unknown in
most new cities; while her greatest danger lies in the
fact that she cannot yet honestly claim those elements
as her own. She is apt to judge a question from a
lower point of view than the question demands&mdash;to
take up a parochial standpoint in municipal affairs, a
municipal standpoint in national affairs, a national
standpoint in imperial questions. In spite of her
many splendid loyalties, she will find it hard to avoid
the assertive <i>contra mundum</i> attitude which seems
inseparable from flourishing colonial cities&mdash;a dogmatism
natural, but unfortunate. On the other hand,
her history and her present status give her a chance
beyond other new cities. She starts on her civic
career already rich, enterprising, the magnet for the
first scientific talent of the world. A fortunate development
might give her a cultivated class, true
political instincts, and the self-restraint which springs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
from a high civilisation, without at the same time
impairing that energy which she owes to her colonial
parentage. The danger is that her ablest element
may continue alien, treating the city as a caravanserai,
and returning to Europe as soon as its ambition is
satisfied. So far the intellect has not been with the
men who have made the place their home, but, subject
to a few remarkable exceptions, with the men who
have never concealed their impatience to get away.
If she fails to make this class her citizens, then, whatever
her prosperity, as a city she will remain mediocre.
Nothing can deprive her of her position as the foremost
market; but if she is to be also the real capital
of South Africa, she must absorb the men who are now
her resident aliens. There are signs, indeed, that the
process has begun in all seriousness. As she becomes
a more pleasant dwelling-place, many who find in the
future of the country the main interest of their lives
will find in Johannesburg the best field of labour for
the end they desire. And the growth of such a
leisured class, who take part in public life for its own
sake and for no commercial interests, will not only
import into municipal politics a broader view and a
healthier spirit, but will do much to secure that community
of interest between town and country by
which alone a united South Africa can be created.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<h4>CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS.</h4>

<p>The constitutional requirements of a country are
never determined solely by its political needs. Some
account must be taken of its prior history, for theories
of government are apt to sink deep into the mind
of a people and to become unconsciously a part of its
political outlook. No form of education is less conscious
or more abiding in its effects. It may even happen
that the fabric which such theories created has been
deliberately overthrown with the popular consent, but
none the less the theories are still there in some form
or other to obtrude themselves in future experiments.
It is always worth while, therefore, in any reconstruction
to look at the ideas of government which held
sway before, whether in the shape of a professed creed
or in the practical form of institutions. The constitutional
history of South Africa is not long, and it is
not complex. In Natal and Cape Colony we possess
two specimens of ordinary self-governing colonies.
Natal, which began life as a Crown colony, subject
to the Governor of the Cape, was granted substantive
independence by charter in 1856, and in 1893 was given
representative government. It possesses a nominated
legislative council of nine members, and an elective
legislative assembly of thirty-nine members, elected
on an easy franchise. Cape Colony also began as a
Crown colony, and followed nearly the same path.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
Her legislative council was created in 1850, and by an
ordinance of this legislature in 1872, ratified by an Act
of the Imperial Parliament, she obtained full representative
institutions. Her council and her house of
assembly are each elected and on the same franchise.
In these two colonies we have, therefore, types
of colonial autonomy&mdash;that is to say, an unfettered
executive and freedom to legislate subject to the consent
of the Governor and the Crown in Council, a
limitation which is daily becoming more of a pious
fiction. In Southern Rhodesia we have a specimen of
that very modern experiment, government by a commercial
company. It is a provisional form, and has
been made to approximate as far as is reasonably
possible to a Crown colony. The executive power is
in the hands of the company&rsquo;s officials, subject to an
indirect control by the Imperial Resident Commissioner,
the High Commissioner, and ultimately by the
Crown. There is a legislative council, partly nominated
by the company and partly elected, and all legislation
is contingent upon the sanction of the imperial authorities.
Lastly, there are the native states, the Crown
colony of Basutoland, and the protectorates of Bechuanaland,
North-West Rhodesia, and Swaziland, all of
which are directly or indirectly under the authority of
the High Commissioner. So far there is no constitutional
novelty&mdash;Crown colonies advancing to an
ordinary type of self-government, or remaining, provisionally
or permanently, under full imperial control.</p>

<p>There remain the late Governments of the Republics,
which to the student of constitutional forms
show certain interesting peculiarities.<a name="FNanchor_30_30"
id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
These constitutions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
were framed by men who had no tradition<a name="FNanchor_31_31"
id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
to fall back upon, if we exclude the Mosaic law, and
no theories to give effect to&mdash;men who would have preferred
to do without government, had it been possible,
but who, once the need became apparent, brought to
the work much shrewdness and good sense. The Natal
emigrants in 1838 had established a Volksraad, but
the chief feature in their scheme was the submission
of all important matters to a primary public assembly,
a Homeric gathering of warriors. By the time the
Sand River and Bloemfontein Conventions were signed
and the two republics became independent, the people
were scattered over a wide expanse of country, and
some form of representation was inevitable. At the
same time, it had become necessary to provide for a
military organisation coextensive with the civil. In
the Transvaal transient republics had arisen and departed,
like the changes in a kaleidoscope. Around
both states there was a native population, actively
hostile and potentially dangerous. Some central military
and civil authority was needed to keep the
country from anarchy. But if the farmers were
without political theories, they had a very vigorous
sense of personal independence; so the doctrinal basis
of the new constitution lay in the axiom that one
burgher in the State is as good as another, and that
the people are the final repository of power. In this at
least they were democratic, though from other traits
of democracy they have ever held aloof.</p>

<p>The <i>Constitutie</i> of the Orange Free State was rigid&mdash;that
is, it could be altered only by methods different
from those of ordinary legislation: in the Transvaal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
<i>Grondwet</i>, on the other hand, there was no provision
for change at all, and reforms, when necessary, were
made in the ordinary legislative manner. The <i>Constitutie</i>
created one supreme legislature, the Volksraad,
elected by the qualified white population. The President
was elected by the whole people, though the
Volksraad, like the Roman consuls, reserved the power
to make nominations, which were generally accepted.
The Volksraad had not only supreme legislative power,
but, while formally independent of the President and
the executive, it could reverse any executive Act,
except the exercise of the President&rsquo;s right of pardon
and the declaration of martial law. It was limited
only by its own charter, which forbade it to restrict
the right of public meeting and petition (one of the
few Bill of Rights elements in this constitution),
and bound it to promote and support the Dutch
Reformed Church. The Transvaal <i>Grondwet</i> began by
making the Dutch Reformed Church an established
national Church (a provision repealed later), and declaring
that &ldquo;the people will not tolerate any equality
between coloured and white inhabitants in Church or
State.&rdquo; No man was eligible for a seat in the Volksraad
unless he was a member of a Protestant Church.<a name="FNanchor_32_32"
id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
In the Transvaal, as in the Orange Free State, the
Volksraad was the supreme legislative authority, but
when any law was proposed the people were given the
opportunity of expressing their opinion in a mild form
of the referendum. The President was elected by
the whole people and acted as chief of the executive,
though responsible to the Volksraad, which could dismiss
him or cancel his appointments. He could sit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
and speak in the Volksraad, but had no vote. The
chief military authority was the Commandant General,
who was elected by all the burghers, and under him
there was a long hierarchy of district commandants
and field-cornets. The local administrative officer for
civil matters was the landdrost or district magistrate.
It is unnecessary to consider the Second Volksraad,
which was an ineffective advisory body elected on a
wider franchise, a mere sop to the Cerberus whose
hundred tongues were clamouring for representation.
But there was one curious development of considerable
historic interest. In cases of urgency the Volksraad
could pass laws without reference to the people at
large, but such an enactment was called a resolution
(<i>besluit</i>) as contrasted with a law (<i>wet</i>), and was
supposed to have only a provisional force. But the
habit grew of calling most matters &ldquo;specially urgent,&rdquo;
and allowing the old popular referendum to fall into
desuetude.</p>

<p>The common feature of both constitutions was
the immense nominal powers of the legislatures.
Nominally they had the right to make all appointments,
to veto the President&rsquo;s action, and to say
the last word in all questions of revenue and expenditure.
But certain facts wrought against this
legislative supremacy. The members came from
districts widely apart, and there was no serious
attempt to form groups or parties; the President
could sit and speak in the Volksraad, and he might
be elected as often as he could persuade the people
to elect him. The way was paved for the tyranny
of a strong man. In the Orange Free State, that
country of mild prosperity and simple problems, the
system worked admirably; but in the Transvaal,
when burning questions arose, the republican methods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
for all serious purposes broke down, and were replaced
by a dictatorship. There remain, however, certain
doctrines from the old <i>rigime</i> which will have to be
reckoned with under the new. The supremacy of the
legislature is not one, for no Boer cared much for the
dogma, and Mr Kruger ruled on the simple maxim,
&ldquo;L&rsquo;itat c&rsquo;est moi.&rdquo; But the democratic principle of
equality among citizens is one cherished belief, and
another is the absolute disqualification of all coloured
races.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a
href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The Boer is not a
parliamentarian in the
ordinary sense, and he did not grieve when his
Volksraad was slighted and made impotent; but he
likes his representative to go to Pretoria, as a sort
of tribute to his importance, and, if he is to vote,
he demands to vote on an equal basis with all. He
was attached to his local administration with its
landdrost system, and any change which bore no relation
to the old plan might begin by confusing and
end by souring him.</p>

<p>We have therefore to face two existing constitutional
traditions&mdash;among the British from the Cape or Natal
or over-seas, the old love of colonial self-government;
among the Boers, at least in the Transvaal, a kind of
ingenuous republican independence, quite consistent
with a patient tolerance of absolutism, but not so easy
to adapt to the gradations of our representative system.
Hence in many ways the Boer is far more likely
to remain patient for years under a Crown colony
Government than the English or colonial new-comer.
He does not particularly want to vote or interfere in
administration, so long as he has no personal grievance;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
but it might annoy him to see the franchise denied to
him and given to his cousin who was a little richer or
better educated, when he remembered the old <i>Grondwet</i>
doctrines of equality, and it would certainly exasperate
him to learn that any native had been
granted a civic status beyond him.</p>

<p class="smlpadt">Such being the constitutional history, we may turn
to the present. The term Crown colony is used so
loosely that very few of its many critics could define
the peculiar features of this form of government.
&ldquo;One of the greatest of all evils,&rdquo; wrote Lord
Durham in the famous Report which has become
the charter of colonial policy, &ldquo;arising from this
system of irresponsible government, was the mystery
in which the motives and actual purposes of their
rulers were hid from the colonists themselves. The
most important business of government was carried
on, not in open discussions or public acts, but in
a secret correspondence between the Governor and
the Secretary of State.&rdquo; This feature, more than
any other, tends to dissatisfaction. The Crown
colony system is necessarily a secret one. The
newspapers, till blue-books are issued, are informed
only as much or as little as the authorities may
think good for them; and the natural critics of all
administration have the somewhat barren pleasure of
finding fault with a policy after it has become a fact.
There is no safety-valve for the escape of grievances,
no official channel even for sound local advice. It is
not to be wondered at, therefore, if it seems an intolerable
burden to men full of anxiety about the methods
by which they are governed.</p>

<p>The Crown colony system is not new to Africa. It
existed for years in the Cape and Natal; it still exists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
in its most rigid form over native states, and at its
worst it does not spurn public opinion in the fashion
of the Kruger <i>rigime</i>&mdash;it simply neglects it. The
name is really a misnomer, for it is no part of the
English colonial system. The American Revolution is
sometimes described as the revolt of an English people
from Crown colony government, but in those days the
thing was not in existence. It is fundamentally the
method invented to govern a race which is incapable
of free representative institutions, or to tide over a
temporary difficulty. The Governor is absolute, subject
to the conditions of his appointment and the
instructions accompanying his letters-patent. He
may be assisted by a council, but it is his privilege,
on reasons shown, to override his council. He is the
sole local fountain of executive and legislative power.
But if he is absolute in one sense, he is strictly tied in
another. The methods of his administration are subject
to certain regulations issued by the Colonial
Office. The Secretary of State must approve his
appointments, and all important administrative acts,
as well as all legislation. Further, in serious questions
the Home Government exercises a general oversight
of policy before the event, and the Governor in
such matters is merely the mouthpiece of the Cabinet.
It is in itself a rational system, and works well under
certain conditions. In a serious crisis, when large
imperial issues are involved, and when local policy is
but a branch of a wider policy, it is highly important
that this day-to-day supervision should exist; and in
a case where speed is essential, Crown colony methods,
though slow enough in all conscience, are rapidity
itself compared with the cumbrous machinery of
representative government.</p>

<p>The necessity of treating the Transvaal and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
Orange River Colony temporarily as Crown colonies
was beyond argument. Reconstruction began in the
midst of war, when the material of self-government
was wanting. It goes on amidst unsettled and dimly
understood conditions, where certain facts of policy
stand out in a strong light and all else is shadow.
It involves many financial transactions in which the
Home Government is deeply interested; and it is
natural that a close administrative connection should
be thought desirable. It comes at the end of a costly
war, and it is right that England should have a direct
say in securing herself against its repetition. The
racial problem is still too delicate to submit to the
arbitrament of popular bodies; and if it were settled
out of hand there might remain an abiding cause of
discontent. The time is not ripe for self-government,
the country has not yet found herself, having but
barely awakened from the torpor of war and begun to
set her house in order. Again, there are factors to be
borne in mind in re-creating the new colonies which
extend far beyond their borders. It is impossible
to imagine that due consideration could be given to
them by the ablest elective body in the world, called
together in the present ferment. Above all, what is
to be done must be done quickly. The wants of the
hour are too urgent for delays. There must be some
authority, trusted by the British Cabinet, capable of
determining the needs of the situation, and giving
summary effect to his decision.</p>

<p>On this all thinking men in the new colonies are
agreed. I do not suppose that any of the more
serious critics of the expedient would be prepared to
propose and defend an alternative. But irritation
remains when reason has done its best, and it is not
hard to see the causes. One is the natural disinclination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
of Englishmen to be ruled from above, a repulsion
which they feel even when arguing in its favour.
Another is the secrecy of Crown colony government,
to which I have already referred. It is painful to find
matters of vital importance to yourself decided without
your knowledge, even when you have the fullest
confidence in the deciding power. There is also,
perhaps, a little distrust still left in South Africa of
the British Government,&mdash;not of particular Ministers,
but of the vague entity behind them&mdash;a distrust
which has had in the past such ample justification
that it is hard to blame it. The colonial mind, too, is
averse to English officialdom, even when represented
by the several highly competent men who have shared
in the present administration. Red-tape, which in its
place is most necessary and desirable, seems to lurk in
the offices of men who are in reality trying hard to
deal with facts in the simplest way. A certain
amount of formal officialdom is necessary in all
government. There must be people to keep an office
in order, to make a fetich of etiquette, to insist on a
stereotyped procedure, and to see the world dimly
through a mist of &ldquo;previous papers.&rdquo; It is a useful,
but not very valuable, type of man, and we cannot
wonder that a South African, who imagines that
such a one has, what he rarely has, an influence in
grave decisions, should view with distrust the form
of government which permits him. It is a mistake,
but one based on an honest instinct.</p>

<p>Self-government is the goal to which all things
hasten, and critics of the present administration check
their complaints at the thought of that beneficent
day. Meanwhile it is our business to set things in
order so that the chosen of the people, when they
enter into their inheritance, may find it swept and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
garnished. Representative institutions should not
spring full grown from an Order in Council, like
Athene from the brain of Zeus: if they do, there
is apt to be a painful crudeness about their early
history. The way should be prepared by gentle
means, for, after all, it is a country in which the
bulk of the residents have had no experience of
governing themselves. The experiment has so far
been tried in two ways. The municipalities represent
the highest level of intelligence and political
training; in municipal affairs, therefore, it is safe to
begin at once with representation. The first town
councils were for all practical purposes Government
departments, nominated by Government and assisted
on their difficult career by Government supervision.
But a nominated town council is an anomaly even
within a Crown colony, since a town council is not
concerned with high politics but only with the administration
of the area in which its citizens choose
to dwell, and any owner of property has a right to a
voice in determining the ways in which his property
shall be safeguarded. The basis of any municipal
franchise is the payment of rates, which imply the
ownership of property; and questions of race, loyalty,
even of education, have no logical place in what is
simply a practical union for the protection of proprietary
interests and the care of the amenities of
civilised life. The question of elective municipalities
is therefore a simple one, and as soon as a municipal
law could be put together, the system was inaugurated.
This is not the place to examine the type of municipal
franchise adopted in the Transvaal, which is a
skilful compendium of various colonial precedents.
But on one matter, the coloured and alien vote, there
was manifested a vigorous tendency to conservatism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
and exclusion. As I have said, this is a province
where racial distinctions have no logical place. If a
black man is a ratepayer he has the citizen&rsquo;s right to
vote. Nor can we on purely rational grounds confine
this franchise to British subjects. But the country
thought differently. As the municipal was her only
form of representation, political considerations crept
in unawares, and the result, while logically indefensible,
has a certain practical justification. For in
a time of reconstruction a community is apt rather
to narrow than enlarge its boundaries, feeling above
all things the need of a compact front against the
unknown. In time, no doubt, the true theory of
municipal franchise will reassert itself, and if, when
the time comes, a constructive policy towards the
subject races has also come into being, the delay will
have been not in vain.</p>

<p>A more important step towards self-government
was the creation of nominated legislative councils for
both colonies, which held their first meetings in the
early part of 1903. In the Transvaal there were
sixteen official members representing the different
Government departments, and fourteen non-official
members selected from representative Englishmen and
Boers in the country. In the Orange River Colony
there were six official members and four non-official.
Some of the new measures which concerned more
deeply the people of the colonies were kept back on
purpose for the opinion of the new councils. Such
were the new gold and diamond laws, the municipal
franchise law, and the ordinances governing the disposal
of town lands. So far the expedient has
promised well; an outlet has been created for public
opinion, though for the present such opinion cannot
carry with it practical force; and the procedure of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
Government has ceased to be a state secret, and is
patent to any one who has the curiosity or the
patience to attend the council&rsquo;s debates. It is interesting
to observe how the unofficial members already
appear in a quasi-representative capacity, and are
beginning to attach themselves to particular districts,
for which, so far as airing grievances and obtaining
information go, they perform most of the duties of
an elected member. There is no reason why such
members should not be elected instead of nominated,
and in this way provide a trial for the form of franchise
on which autonomy is to be based. There are
many obvious difficulties in any franchise for the new
colonies, and it would be well for such difficulties
to be realised and faced while the whole matter is
still mainly academic, and errors are not yet attended
with practical disaster.</p>

<p class="smlpadt">The franchise for the new colonies is the constitutional
problem which is of the most immediate
importance. It will not be wise to delay the era
of self-government long, for between the most elastic
Crown colony and the narrowest free colony there
is an inseparable gulf, and though it may be said
justly that with an elective legislature the colonies
have something very like freedom, the one thing
needful will still be lacking. It is not enough to
put the oars into their hands; we must cut the
painter before they are truly free. There is one
postulate in all franchise discussions which is likely
to be vigorously attacked. The franchise must be
based in the first instance upon the principle of
giving adequate representation to all districts and
every interest; but, once this has been recognised, the
second principle appears&mdash;of providing for the supremacy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
of the British population. That saying of Dogberry&rsquo;s,
&ldquo;An two men ride of a horse, one must ride
behind,&rdquo; is a primary law not only of equitation but
of politics in the treatment of a conquered country.
For conquered it is, and there is little use disguising
it: we have not been fighting for the love of it or for
fine sentiment, but to conquer the land and give our
people the mastery. The last word in all matters
must rest with us&mdash;that is, with the people of British
blood and British sympathies. Both men must be
on the horse, or, apart from parable, each race must
have fair and ample representation. To deny this
would be to sin against sound policy. But not
to take measures to see that our own race has
the casting vote is to be guilty of the commonest
folly. &ldquo;An two men ride of a horse, one must ride
behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whoever denies this principle may spare himself the
trouble of reading further, for it is proposed to treat
it as axiomatic. The first type of franchise need not
be permanent: a day may come when it will be needless
to consider the distinction of Dutch and British.
But as it was right and politic on the conclusion of
war to disarm our opponents, so it is right and politic
in the first franchise to put no weapon of offence
into their hands. The primary adjustment of the
franchise and the primary distribution of seats must
be made with this clear end in view&mdash;to secure a
working majority for the British people. It is obvious
that the words &ldquo;British population&rdquo; are vague, and
include many odd forms of nationality, but the thing
itself is simple, the class whose interests and sentiment
are on the British side, who seek progress on
British lines. It does not follow that the majority of
the Dutch will go into opposition, but it is ordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
prudence to keep on the safe side. Such a policy
involves no distrust of the Dutch population, but is
the common duty of those who for a certain period
must, as conquerors, take the initiative in administration,
and, as bearing the responsibility, preserve
an adequate means of control.</p>

<p>The terms of the franchise are a more difficult
matter. In Cape Colony citizenship and a low
property qualification are the chief conditions. In
Southern Rhodesia, whose franchise law is an especially
clear and sensible code, an oath of loyalty is
accepted in lieu of technical citizenship, and an
easy educational test is demanded&mdash;the ability of
a voter to sign his name and write his address and
occupation. In Natal there is a sharp distinction
drawn between Europeans and all others. To them
the only tests are citizenship, and the ownership or
occupation of property of a certain value, or the
receipt of a certain amount of income. The native
is practically disqualified by a law denying the
franchise to any person subject to special courts or
special laws, and though a means of escape is provided,
the conditions are too complex even for more
intelligent minds than the native. It is an ingenious
but not wholly satisfactory device. Asiatics are
excluded by the law which denies votes to natives,
or descendants in the male line of natives, of any
country which does not enjoy the blessings of representative
government; and though in their case also
there is a way of escape, it is almost equally difficult.
The root distinction between types of franchise lies
in the method employed to exclude an undesirable
class, whether a direct one, by disqualifying in so
many words, or an indirect, by setting one standard of
qualification for all, to which, as a matter of fact, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
undesirable class cannot attain. The balance of argument
is, on the whole, on the side of the second
method, which has been adopted in Cape Colony and
Rhodesia, though, perhaps, with too low a standard.
But the first method, if followed more frankly than in
Natal, has something to be said for it. There is no
reason why the better class of Indians should not vote,
if their race is considered fit to mix on equal terms
with English society elsewhere; but to my mind
there is a very good reason why the native should
not vote&mdash;at least, not for the present. The easy
way of securing this result is the old method of the
Transvaal <i>Grondwet</i>, which said shortly, &ldquo;There shall
be no equality between black and white.&rdquo; It is the
way, too, which, under the Conditions of Surrender,
would have to be adopted in any trial franchise put
into force before self-government. I am not sure
whether it is not the most philosophic as well as the
simplest way, for it denies the native the franchise not
for a lack of property or educational qualification, but
for radical mental dissimilarity. In any case it is a
matter which must be left for the people of the
colony to settle for themselves. But for all others,
while the property basis of the franchise should be
low, there are grounds for thinking that a reasonably
high educational test should be added. The
lower type of European and the back-veld Dutchman
have in their present state no equitable right
to the decision, which the franchise gives, on matters
which they are unable to come within a measurable
distance of understanding. The fact that the fool
may have a vote at home is no reason for exalting
him to the same level in a country which is not
handicapped by a constitutional history. Some form
of British citizenship, obtainable by a short and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
simple method, must also be demanded if the land
is to remain a British colony.</p>

<p>Once the franchise has been determined there remains
the division of constituencies. The axiom has
already been explained which appears to govern this
question. But in the absence of anything approaching
correct census returns it is difficult to suggest,
even tentatively, a distribution of seats. The fairest
way to secure the representation of all interests seems
to be to divide constituencies into three types. First,
there are the large towns, which for the present, to
take the Transvaal, may be limited to Johannesburg
and Pretoria. These would be given members according
to their population. Second, come groups of country
burghs, such groups as the Northern Burghs, with
Nylstroom, Warm Baths, Piet Potgieter&rsquo;s Rust, and
Pietersburg; and the Eastern Burghs, with Middelburg
and Belfast, Lydenburg and Barberton. Here,
too, members would be allotted according to population,
though the number of voters required to form a
constituency should be fewer. Lastly, there would
be the country districts, substantially the present
fourteen magisterial divisions, and there the numbers
of a constituency would be still smaller. That it is
fair to differentiate in favour of the counties against
the burghs, and in favour of the burghs against the
large towns, will appear on a brief consideration. The
interests of the different constituencies in a city, at
least in a new city, are practically identical. In the
country burghs the interests vary, but still within
narrow limits. In the counties, on the other hand,
there is often a very wide variation. The dwellers in
Barberton have wholly different problems and grievances
from the dwellers in Bloemhof or Standerton.
But while this principle is right, the former axiom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
must be kept in mind, that, provided fair representation
is granted to all, the constituencies must be so
arranged as to ensure British predominance. Certain
counties will, I believe, be on the whole British in time&mdash;Bloemhof,
Marico, Zoutpansberg, possibly Waterberg,
possibly Lydenburg, undoubtedly Barberton.
The burghs, too, will yield on the whole a British
voting population. In all likelihood, therefore, our
purpose will be secured by the division of constituencies
which I have suggested, even allowing for a
differentiation in favour of the rural districts. Figures
are still impossible in the absence of a census,
but on the roughest estimate there may be in the
Transvaal at the present moment a Boer population
of 100,000, with a voting proportion of 30,000, and
a British population of perhaps 150,000, with a voting
proportion of 50,000 or upwards. In the Orange
River Colony before the war the voters&rsquo; roll showed
just over 17,000, and if we put the vote on an enlarged
franchise at 20,000, we may be near the mark.
The position of the latter colony will not change
greatly in the next decade, but the Transvaal may
easily in a few years show a million inhabitants and
more. With a population thus constantly increasing
and liable to great local fluctuations, redistribution
may soon become a vexed question and a source of
political chicanery. It would be well if the endless
friction which attends redistribution courts and commissions
could be saved by some automatic system
under which sudden local inequalities could be speedily
and finally adjusted.</p>

<p class="smlpadt">The greatest constitutional calamity which could
befall South Africa would be for the Dutch in the
new colonies to go as a race into opposition. I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
said that they are not born parliamentarians, and
that, to begin with at least, they will be a little
strange to the forms and methods of English representative
government. But they are a strong and
serious people, and if they desire, as a race, to form
an opposition, they will learn the tactics of a parliament
as readily as their kinsmen have done in the
Cape. It will be difficult to form out of so practical
and stable a folk such an opposition as the Nationalist
party in Ireland; but if they have real grievances
to fight for, it is conceivable that the Dutch people
might be organised into as solid a voting machine as
the Irish peasantry under the control of the Land
League and the Church. Attempts will doubtless be
made to bring this about. Certain institutions will
spare no pains to secure so promising a recruit in
their policy of emphasising every feature in the South
African situation which tends to disunion. On the
other hand, certain of the natural leaders of the
Dutch people, who have acquired the spurious race-hatred
which intriguers and adventurers have built up
during the past twenty years, in a desperately discreet
and orthodox manner may work to the same
end. But fortunately there are signs that the party
division, when it comes, will be lateral and not
vertical. It is a phenomenon often observed in a long
war, that a day of apathy sets in, differences arise
in a party, and one section begins to dislike the other
far more than it hates the common enemy. This
phenomenon, which in war spells disaster, is salutary
enough in civil politics. In both races there are signs
of divisions, and on each side there is a party unconsciously
drawing nearer to their old opponents. The
majority of the Dutch have little rancour, except
against each other; to many the Bond is as much an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
object of suspicion as, let us say, Mr Chamberlain.
The old nebulous Pan-Afrikander dreams were in no
way popular with the Transvaal Boer, who would
have been nearly as much annoyed at being harassed
with an Afrikander federation as at being annexed
to Natal. Besides, he is not a good party man, being
too sincere an individualist. Intrigue of the carpet-bag
and secret-league variety he will never shine in,
and he does not desire to, though apt enough at a
kind of rustic diplomacy. There is, further, a party
ready made for him. He is frankly anti-Johannesburg,
a pure agrarian. Already the anomalous labour
party of the Rand are making overtures to him, and
with loud declamations on his merits strive to attract
his sympathies. On certain matters he may join
them, but it will be an odd union, and not a long one.
Town and country will never long remain in conjunction,
and there are few items, indeed, of a labour
programme to which he would subscribe.</p>

<p>It is difficult to draw with any confidence the
political horoscope of the new colonies. Certain
eternal antitheses will exist,&mdash;Capital and Labour,
Rand and Veld, Progress and the staunchest of
staunch Conservatisms,&mdash;but none of them seem
likely to coalesce so as to form any permanent division
of parties. It is as easy to imagine Rand capitalists
and country Dutch united on certain questions as
Boer and Labour. Possibly the old distinction of
Liberal and Tory in some form or other will appear
in the end. It is said that the colonies are aggressively
Liberal; but these are different from other
colonies, and the groundwork of Conservatism already
exists. We have a plutocracy and a landed aristocracy.
We have also in the legal element a class,
in its South African form, peculiarly tenacious of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
the letter of the law. We have an established kirk
in all but name, and a racial tradition of resistance
to novelty. With the growth of a rich and leisured
population, and of social grades and conventions,
there will come a time when politics may well be
divided between those who are satisfied with things
as they are, and those who hunger for things as
they cannot be&mdash;with, of course, a sprinkling of
plain men who do their work without theories. We
shall have the doctrinaire idealist, doubtless, to experiment
on the labour and native questions; and
in place of having politics based on interests, we
may have them based in name and reality on creeds
and dogmas, which is what English constitutionalism
desires. All such developments are just and normal,
and in any one the land may find political stability.</p>

<p>There is one contingency alone which must be
regarded with the greatest dread&mdash;the growth of
a South African party, which is South African because
anti-British. The war raised colonial loyalty
to a height; but such loyalty is like a rocket, which
may speedily expire in the void in a blaze of brightness,
or may kindle a steady flame if the material
be there. We must remember that we have in the
Dutch a large population to which the British tie
means nothing; a large and important class, in the
cosmopolitan financiers, who may be covertly hostile
to British interests; and even in some of the most
sterling and public-spirited citizens men who, if the
Dutch Government had allowed them, would have
surrendered their nationality and become citizens of
the republics. South African loyalty, splendid as it
is, is rather fidelity to British traditions than to
that overt link which constitutes empire. You will,
indeed, hear the true theory of colonial policy well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
stated and strongly defended; but it must not be
forgotten that in South Africa it is still somewhat
of an exotic plant, and wants careful tending before
it can come to maturity. Unadvised action on our
part may nip the growth, and give a chance for
a party which might declare, to adopt the words of
the old loyalists of Lower Canada, that it was
determined to be South African even at the cost
of ceasing to be British. A too long or too straitly
ordered tutelage might do it, or a harsh dictation
on some local question of vital interest, or the continuance
of the old calumnies about the Rand, the
old vulgar sneer at the colonial-born. It is well to
remember that while the land is a Crown colony it
is one only in name, and that all the tact and discretion
which we use in dealing with self-governing
colonies should be used in this case also.</p>

<p>Such a party may arise, but there is no reason in
the nature of things for its existence. South African
and British are not opposites. As I understand the
theory of colonial government, England stands towards
her colonies as a parent who starts his sons in the
world, wishing them all prosperity; and though in
after-years he may exercise the parental right of
giving advice, he will not attempt to coerce the
action of those who have come to years of maturity.
The tie is strongest when it is not of the letter but
of the spirit. At the same time it is well to preserve
certain outward and visible signs of descent,&mdash;well
for the fatherland, better for the colonies, who
draw from that fatherland their social and political
traditions and their spiritual sustenance. At the
moment South Africa is in a transition stage. Her
public opinion is scarcely formed on any subject;
she is full of vague aspirations, uneasy yearnings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
and half-fledged hopes. She will develop either into
the staunchest of allies in any imperial federation,
or the most recalcitrant and isolated of colonies.
She has enough and to spare of good men who
desire nothing more than that the African nation,
when it comes, should be a British people, and if
she is trusted whole-heartedly, she will not betray
the trust. She will even accept advice and reproof
in proper cases, for, unless we drive her to ingratitude,
she is not ungrateful for the blood and treasure
which Britain has spent on her making. But she
is like a young well-bred colt, whose mouth may be
easily spoiled by over-bitting, and whose temper will
be ruined by the bad hands or too hasty temper of
its trainer.</p>

<p>Two important constitutional questions remain.
One is the great policy of Federation, which looms
as a background behind all sporadic constitutional
forms. The second concerns that part of the imperial
forces which is to be stationed in South
Africa&mdash;a matter which is not only an army question
but one deeply affecting colonial interests. To
these the two succeeding chapters are devoted.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<h4>THE POLICY OF FEDERATION.</h4>

<p>No South African problem is more long-descended
than the question of Federation. It was a dream of
Sir George Grey&rsquo;s in the mid-century, and it was a
central feature in the policy of Sir Bartle Frere&mdash;that
policy which, after twenty years of obscuration, is at
last seen in its true and beneficent light. Nor was it
held only by English governors. Local statesmen in
Cape Colony saw in it a panacea for the endless
frontier difficulties which tried their patience and
their talents. The ultra-independent colonist, in
whose ears &ldquo;Africa for the Afrikanders&rdquo; was beginning
to ring, seized upon it as a lever towards a more
complete autonomy. Men like Mr Rhodes, to whom
Africa was an empire and its people one potential
nation, looked on it as the first step towards this
larger destiny. Every student of political history
for the last fifty years, considering the physical situation
of the different states and the absence of any
final dividing line between them, confidently anticipated
for South Africa, and under more favourable
conditions, the development which Australia has
already reached. But the movement shipwrecked
on the northern republics. Old grievances and
jealousies set the Transvaal and the Orange Free
State in arms against the prospect, and, since the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
essence of federation is full mutual consent, the project
failed at the first hint of serious opposition. Now
all things are changed. The social and constitutional
difficulties which would obviously arise from the
inclusion of independent or all but independent
states in a federation of colonies have disappeared
with the independent states themselves. Now at
last all South Africa save the Portuguese and German
seaboards is under one flag.</p>

<p>The chief barriers have gone, but the need for
federation is as insistent as ever. A common flag
is a strong tie, but it does not in practice prevent
many local jealousies and petty oppositions. Disunion
is only justifiable among colonies of equal standing
when there is some insuperable physical barrier
between them or some radical disparity of interests.
Providence is so clearly on the side of the larger
social battalions, that an isolated state, though
within a colonial system, is at a disadvantage even in
matters concerning its own interests. The nationalism
which rejoices in local distinctions, however
recent in origin, is admirable enough in its way,
and ought to be preserved; therefore the complete
merging of several units in one is always to be
regretted, even when justified by grave needs. The
new state will never or not for a long time acquire
the consistency and proud self-consciousness of the
destroyed units. But federation shows another and
a better way. The parts are maintained in full
national existence, but in so far as their interests
transcend their own boundaries they are united in
one larger state. There is another advantage, often
pointed out by American writers on the subject,
which concerns a country like South Africa, whose
boundaries cannot yet be said to be finally delimited.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
North of the Zambesi there is a vast vague region,
partly under the High Commissioner, partly included
in British Central Africa, which in time will become
separate colonies, with interests wholly different from
the states of the south. To add a new tract and
a novel population to a state is always a difficult
matter, for the existing <i>rigime</i> may be most unsuited
for such extension. But it is easy to include a new
colony in a federation. In Mr Bryce&rsquo;s words, federation
&ldquo;permits an expansion, whose extension and
whose rate and manner of progress cannot be foreseen,
to proceed with more variety of methods, more
adaptation of laws and administration to the circumstances
of each part of the territory, and altogether
in a more truly natural and spontaneous way than
can be expected under a centralised government.
Thus the special needs of a new <i>rigime</i> are met by
the inhabitants in the way they find best; its special
evils are met by special remedies, perhaps more drastic
than an old country demands, perhaps more lax than
an old country would tolerate; while at the same
time the spirit of self-reliance among those who
build up these new communities is stimulated and
respected.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a
href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The need for federation in the case of South Africa
is made greater by the fact that there are one or two
burning questions common to all her states which
cannot be satisfactorily settled save by joint action.
Foremost stands the native problem. If there is not
some sort of geographical continuity of policy in the
treatment of natives, all our efforts will be unavailing.
The natives of South Africa may be regarded, among
other things, as a great industrial reserve; and if the
policy outlined in another chapter is to be followed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
different labour laws and different methods of taxation
may work incalculable harm. If extravagant
inducements to work are held out in the Transvaal,
it will not be long before the labour market is ruined
elsewhere. If an improvident system of taxation
exists in Natal, it may unsettle and discontent other
native populations, since it is highly probable that in
the future natives will be less tied to localities, and
will move through the whole country in search of
work. The mining authorities have long recognised
the necessity of a single policy, as is shown by such
institutions as the Chamber of Mines and the Native
Labour Association; and it would be odd if in political
questions, where the need is equally urgent, the same
truth should be neglected. In connection with natives
the control of the sale of intoxicants is another matter
of South African importance. It is a matter on which
South Africa is now practically at one; but there are
limits to the prescience of local legislation and local
officials, and it may easily happen that an inadequate
law inadequately administered in one colony may
undo most of the good that an energetic administration
is attempting in another. If identity of policy,
again, is indispensable in relation to the subject races,
the same identity is most desirable in those inter-racial
questions between white men which will long
have their place in South African politics. An unwise
treatment of the Dutch population in the Cape will
infallibly react on the new colonies. Any one who
knows the way in which Cape precedents in this
connection are quoted in the Transvaal, just as
Transvaal precedents were quoted before the war
in the Cape, will recognise the difficulty which the
present disunion creates. In educational matters,
such as the proportion of time devoted to the teaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
of the Dutch language, while every colony must
necessarily decide for itself, there is great need of
one controlling authority to supervise and direct.
There is, again, the question of permit law and the
exclusion of undesirables, and the kindred matter
of the position of the imperial forces. A lax permit
law in one colony nullifies all the strictness of its
neighbours. Army questions&mdash;whatever the future
position of the South African force&mdash;will always have
an intercolonial significance, for the different troops
are under one commander-in-chief, they will meet for
training and man&oelig;uvres, and they are part of one
general scheme of imperial defence. In some questions
an attempt at co-operation has already been made,&mdash;in
railway conferences and customs unions,&mdash;but it
is obviously a clumsy method which proceeds from
conference agreements to ratification by the several
legislatures; and many important and difficult questions
will go on arising from day to day which
will be decided in quite different ways by local
authorities, to the confusion of all and the increase
of unnecessary distinctions. Lastly, there are a number
of lesser matters, of which veterinary and game
regulations may be taken as the type, whose treatment,
to be satisfactory, must be governed by a
common principle and in the hands of a common
executive.</p>

<p>Such are a few of the practical reasons for federation.
There is a deeper reason based on the future
of our colonial system. South Africa at the present
moment is deeply cleft by gulfs of race, fiscal policy,
imperial attachment. There will always be within
her bounds a party, not perhaps a very important
or very intelligent party, made up of those to whom
the British tie is galling and the tradition of kinship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
mere foolishness. If the present particularism is
allowed to remain unreformed, it may easily happen
that in this colony or that some turn of the political
wheel may give such a party an authoritative voice,
and the result may be the beginning of endless
misunderstandings, and in the end the creation of
an impassable gulf. It is because South Africa as
a whole is so unswerving in her loyalty that it is
wise to create some united authority representing the
whole land, and looking at this great question from
a high standpoint, which can provide against the
parochialism of a party and the accidental caprice of
a state. This feeling is strong among the English
inhabitants of the new colonies, and is, I believe,
destined to grow in width and strength throughout
the country, when the fever of reconstruction is at
an end and South Africa has leisure to meditate on
her political future.</p>

<p>If we examine present conditions we can discern,
to borrow the common metaphor of writers on federation,
both centripetal and centrifugal tendencies. To
begin with, the constitutional framework exists. The
head of a federation is already at hand in the High
Commissioner, in whom is vested the government of
all South Africa apart from the self-governing colonies.
It was the custom formerly to combine this office with
the governorship of the Cape: for the moment it is
joined with the governorship of the Transvaal and
the Orange River Colony. With the present narrow
definition of the High Commissioner&rsquo;s duties, it is
right that this should be so; but there is no constitutional
reason why he should not be a separate
official. It has never been a popular office with self-governing
colonies, who dislike the idea that the
governorship should have in one of its aspects powers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
over which the colony has no control; but this objection
could not arise to the head of a federal
government. By the letters patent of 1900 the
High Commissioner is invested with the control of
the South African Constabulary in the new colonies
and the administration of the Central South African
railways, and he is empowered to call together conferences
of the self-governing colonies for the discussion
of common problems. Here is already existing
the administrative machinery of a federation.
The rock on which many federal enterprises have
split is the election of the supreme head, and in most
systems it is the weakest point. But South Africa
is saved this part of the problem. She has a supreme
federal office, which has existed for more than twenty
years, and with the slightest alteration of functions
the High Commissionership could be transformed into
a Federal Viceroyalty.</p>

<p>South Africa, again, is for all practical purposes a
geographical whole. The vast tableland which makes
up nine-tenths of it has almost everywhere uniform
climatic conditions, and the strips of coast land have
among themselves a comparatively uniform character,
so that two types may be said to exhaust its geographical
and climatic features. There is no distinction so
radical as between the Atlantic states and Texas or
between Nebraska and the Pacific seaboard. This
physical harmony prevents any natural cleavages,
such as impassable mountain-ranges or large navigable
rivers; and it imposes upon the inhabitants uniformity
in modes of travel, and in the simpler conditions of
life. If we look at the people of the several states we
find a common nationality&mdash;or rather a common admixture
of nationalities. The English proportion may
be much higher in Natal and the eastern province of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
Cape Colony, the Dutch in the western province and
the Orange River Colony; but everywhere there is
the same divided race, and in consequence kindred
political problems. There is, further, one supreme
Imperial Government for all, one constitutional tradition
to provide, as it were, a background to local
politics and a basis for federation. There are common
dangers from invasion, against which all the colonies
are protected by one navy. Subject to minor local
differences, there is a common structure observable in
the constitutions of the several self-governing colonies
to which the Transvaal and Orange River Colony will
no doubt in time approximate. Many of the most
vital problems are the same for the whole of South
Africa,&mdash;the control and the civilisation of the natives,
the amalgamation of the two white races, the conservation
of water, the protection against pests and
stock diseases. Two of the most important administrative
departments have already a common
basis, if they are still far from complete union.
All South African railway systems, now that the old
Beira line has been relaid, have the same gauge, their
rolling stock is interchangeable, officials pass readily
from one system to another, and by means of railway
conferences attempts have been made to arrive at a
common understanding on railway policy. Finally, all
South Africa is now united in one Customs Union.</p>

<p>But if the centripetal elements,<a name="FNanchor_35_35"
id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
which make for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
federation, are numerous and potent, disjunctive and
centrifugal forces also exist, though they create no
difficulties which a patient statesmanship could not
surmount. The obvious historical and racial differences
between the colonies may be neglected, for,
though on one side a force of separation, they are
in another and more important aspect an agency for
union, since they create a problem which in some form
or other every colony has to meet. The primary disruptive
force is economic. The interests, the material
interests, of the population of each colony are widely
different. In Cape Colony, on the whole, the farming
interest predominates, though there, again, there is
an internal distinction between the aims of the vine-growing
and agricultural south-west and the pastoral
north and east. Natal, so far as it is not a huge forwarding
agency, is also based on agriculture. The
Orange River Colony, though it has a respectable
mining interest, is, and will doubtless remain, pre-eminently
a pastoral state. The development of
Rhodesia is not yet quite apparent, but it is probable
that it will end by having a mining and a
farming interest of about equal strength. But the
Transvaal is overwhelmingly industrial both in population
and prospects. In time, no doubt, Transvaal
agriculture will play an important part, but the main
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
asset of the colony must long be found in her mines,
and the subsidiary industries created by them, which
will be left as a legacy when the reefs are worked out
to the last pennyweight. That is to say, in South
Africa there are three colonies where the predominant
interest is agricultural,&mdash;one in which the mining and
farming interests are likely to be evenly matched, and
one, the richest and therefore not the least important,
in which the mining interest casts all others into the
shade. It is obvious that economic policy will vary
greatly in each, even in those general matters which
would naturally fall under the survey of a federal
government. The bias of the agricultural colonies is
towards protection; the absolute necessity of Rhodesia
and the Transvaal is free trade or a near approach to
it. The industrial population of the Rand must have
food at a reasonable price, else the labour bill will
wipe off the profits of the mines, and to secure this
cheap food, taking into consideration the long railway
freights, entry at the coast free of duty is desired.
So too with the raw material of mining: any taxation
of such imports is directly inimical to the prosperity
of South Africa&rsquo;s foremost industry. On the other
hand, the coast farmers have good grounds to complain.
They look to the Rand for their market, and
unless they are to be secured from the competition
of lands like the Argentine, where food-stuffs can be
grown almost as a waste product, they will grumble
against any rebate of coast duties.</p>

<p>The deadlock might be final were it not for the
geographical position of the Transvaal. Had she a
port of her own she might well decline any federation,
and continue to import on her own terms, leaving the
other colonies to make the best of it. But, as things
stand, she has to bring in most of her imports through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
ports in the coast colonies, and for a large part of the
distance over their lines of railway. Were this, again,
a full statement of the case, the Transvaal might be
at the mercy of the other colonies, and be compelled
to accept their terms or starve. But fortunately the
Transvaal, while not in a position to dictate absolutely,
has a card of her own by which she can
command reasonable treatment. She can import by
the much shorter line from Delagoa Bay, and she is
contemplating the construction of an alternative line
to the same port. These two lines, when completed,
will make her virtually independent of the coast
colonies, provided&mdash;a provision which there seems
no reason to doubt&mdash;a good understanding is maintained
with Portugal. Clearly some <i>modus vivendi</i>
must be arrived at if there is not to be an endless
friction, which can only result in inconvenience to the
interior colony and great financial loss to the coast.<a name="FNanchor_36_36"
id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>This chief centrifugal force, divergence of economic
interests, becomes, therefore, in practice a powerful
centripetal force, the chief lever of federation. Some
kind of harmony must be attained; the only question
is whether this agreement is to be partial and temporary
or thorough and final. Federation, while on
its practical side a familiar policy to all classes in
South Africa, is still in its political aspect a little
strange to men&rsquo;s minds, smacking somewhat of constitutional
doctrinairedom. When we are dealing
with self-governing colonies, there can be no question
of imposing it as a mandate from above: to be
effective and permanent it must come from within,
a proposal based on a national conviction. There
was, indeed, a time in the last year of the war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
when Cape Colony lay in the throes of disruption,
and her wisest citizens were weary of the vagaries of
her politics; when Natal was acquiescent, and when
the new colonies were still a battlefield. It seemed
to many that then a federation might have been
imposed with the consent of most thinking men.
But the moment passed; local politics were restored
to their old activity, and the opportunity for imperial
interference was gone. A federal movement must
therefore advance slowly and circumspectly, and be
content with small beginnings, lest any hint of
coercion should drive the units still farther apart.</p>

<p>There is no argument so convincing as success,
and a satisfactory federation in miniature would go
far to prepare the way for the larger scheme. Fortunately
we have one sphere where experiments towards
federation can be given a fair trial. The Transvaal
and the Orange River Colony are under one governor
and the same system of government. Though they
have many points of difference, they have also many
common problems which are even now dealt with by
one central authority. The South African Constabulary
in the two colonies is one force under one
Inspector-General. The Central South African railways,
which control the whole railway system, are
under one Railway Commissioner and one General
Manager. Education is under one Director of Education.
In addition to this departmental union, the two
colonies are subject to one common debt, the Guaranteed
Loan. The War Debt lies for the present
wholly on the Transvaal;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a
href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> but the loan for reconstruction
is devoted to purposes common to both,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
and they are jointly and severally liable for its interest
and redemption. If the Orange River Colony
were to pay its fair share of the interest&mdash;having
regard to the capital expenditure apportioned to it&mdash;it
would be bankrupt to-morrow. It must either
pay a great deal less than its due, or some arrangement
must be arrived at by which there is no fixed
apportionment of either interest or capital, but the
whole debt is administered jointly, and charged
upon certain common properties.</p>

<p>The method adopted has been fully explained in
another chapter. Here it will be sufficient to point
out the federal consequences of the arrangement. If
the railways, the South African Constabulary, and all
common services are to be charged to one common
budget, and subjected to a common administration,
then some kind of common council must be established
with a share of both legislative and executive powers.
It would be necessary to give this council, or some
committee of it, the final decision in railway administration,
to grant it power to operate upon railway
profits, and to make grants for the services of the
loan, and for other services placed under its authority,
without reference to the councils of the separate
colonies. Such powers have not been unknown in
constitutional history, and Austro-Hungary furnishes
an instructive precedent. There we find a common
executive, not responsible to either of the two Parliaments,
for such common interests as foreign affairs,
the army, and imperial finance. On most matters
connected with these common interests the separate
Parliaments legislate; but the voting of money for
common purposes and the control of the common
executive is placed in the hands of the famous
Delegations, which are appointed by the two Parliaments.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
The position is, therefore, that there is a
common Ministry for Finance, War, and Foreign
Affairs, controlled by the Delegations, and working
on funds voted and appropriated by the Delegations.
This power of appropriation without ratification by
the separate colonies is the essence of the new council,
which is thus, to continue the parallel, a compound of
the Delegations and the Common Ministry of Austro-Hungary.
Certain funds are ear-marked for its use,
and its deficits, if any, will be met by contributions,
in certain fixed proportions, from the treasuries of the
two colonies; while its surplus, if it is ever fortunate
enough to have one, will be divided, in whole or in
part, between the two colonies, going as a matter of
fact to assist in meeting the charges of the War Debt.
It has an administrative control over all existing
common services, and any other which may be subsequently
put under its charge by the local legislatures.</p>

<p>Such a council obviously falls far short of a true
federation. It is primarily a financial expedient to
provide a simple and effective machinery for administering
somewhat complicated finances. But it is a
step, and a considerable step, in the right direction.
Its executive functions are concerned with truly
federal matters; and its powers of acting alone in
questions of administration, and of voting and appropriating
funds without reference to the separate
legislatures, is a recognition of the central doctrine
of federation. Indeed at the present moment the
two new colonies have a <i>de facto</i> federal government.
The grant to the new council of legislative powers on
matters of common interest, and the corresponding
limitation of the powers of the separate legislatures,
would establish a complete <i>de jure</i> federation. There
is no reason why this goal should not soon be reached.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
The two colonies are bound together by many ties,&mdash;above
all, by that most stringent bond, a common
debt. For three years they have been administered
by one governor. Though there may be symptoms of
local jealousy in both, there can be no real popular
objection, as there is no logical reason, against their
federation.</p>

<p>But while the new colonies present a simple problem,
the extension of the policy to the self-governing
colonies requires delicate and cautious handling. If
the limited federation be a success, it will have the
power of a good example, especially since there are
many throughout South Africa to seize and emphasise
the lesson. Meantime other agencies are at work for
union. The Bloemfontein Conference of March 1903,
which, in addition to settling a customs&rsquo; tariff and
recommending a preferential policy for British goods,
passed resolutions on certain questions, such as native
affairs, of wide South African interest, is the type of
that informal advisory union which may well come
into being at once. The appointment, further, of a
South African committee to investigate some of the
more vexed and obscure details of native policy, is
another step in the same direction. The new colonies,
which contain the chief motive force for South Africa&rsquo;s
future, must give the lead. They hold in their hands
the guide-ropes, for federation may be said to depend
upon the development of two problems&mdash;the racial and
the economic; and both reach their typical form in
the new colonies. In these questions are involved the
chief grounds of separation and the chief impulses
towards union, and according as the new colonies
settle them within their own bounds will arise the
need and desire for a more comprehensive settlement.</p>

<p>The type of federation which South Africa may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
adopt will, no doubt, vary considerably from most
historical precedents. It should in certain respects
be more rigid, since, apart from a few outstanding
troubles, there are no permanent differences between
the parts. In certain respects, too, it should be more
elastic, for a federated South Africa would be not only
a substantive state, but a member of a greater system,
and some of the old free colonial traditions which
pertain to that system should be left to the federated
units. It is a vain task at this stage to attempt the
outlines of a scheme, since the foundations are not yet
fully apparent. Needs which are now in embryo will
be factors to be reckoned with when the time is ripe,
and perhaps some of the forces which seem to us
to-day to dominate all else will have disappeared or
decreased in strength. There is a wealth of historical
precedent for South African statesmen to follow; for,
apart from the United States and sundry European
parallels, there are two types of federation within the
colonial system&mdash;the Dominion of Canada and the
recently created Australian Commonwealth. Between
them these two cases provide a most complete parallel
for South Africa. In Canada there was a distinction
of races not less marked than Dutch and English.
There was, further, an imperfectly explored hinterland
which the colonists looked to bring by degrees under
the same constitution. In Australia there were grave
intercolonial disputes on railways and customs and a
wide divergence of economic interests. A keen
jealousy was felt by the smaller for the larger states,
and the scheme of federation had to be delicately
framed to adjust state pride with federal requirements.
On the whole, the difficulties which the framers of
the federal constitution had to face in Canada and
Australia were greater than we find in South Africa:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
in the United States, immeasurably greater. But
often the probability of federation stands in inverse
ratio to the ease with which it can be effected, and the
very simplicity of this South African problem may
delay its settlement. There are, however, forces which
must between them hasten the end. One is the
economic disparity, at least as great as in Australia
and greater than in Canada, which makes itself felt so
constantly in the daily life of the inland colonies, that
they may find themselves compelled to push the matter
in spite of the apathy of the coast. The other is the
very real national sentiment which is growing to
maturity in the country. The war has welded the
English inhabitants into something approaching a
nation. Having suffered so deeply, they are the less
prone to local jealousies and the more attached to the
ideal of imperial unity.</p>

<p>A scheme of South African federation, as has been
said, will have to differ materially from any of the
existing types. Though details are premature, certain
principles may be accepted as essential. The first
concerns the subjects relegated to the Federal Government.
In the United States these are, roughly,
foreign affairs, the army and navy, federal courts of
justice, commerce, currency, the post office, certain
general branches of commercial law, such as copyrights
and patents, an oversight of the separate states to
protect the inhabitants against any infringement of
the fundamental rights granted by the constitution,
and taxation for federal purposes. Several of these
functions are needless in a federation of English
colonies. Foreign affairs and army and navy questions
assume a different form from what they present
in a wholly separate community; and since there is no
<i>Grondwet</i> known to English constitutional law, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
is no need for an oversight of the separate states in
case of its infringement. That is already provided for
by the ultimate right of the British Crown to annul
legislation which may conflict with the chartered
rights or limitations of a colony. But there are
certain powers, not referred to in the American
scheme, which are essential to a modern system.
Railways, telephones, and telegraphs should come
under the purview of the national Government, as also
all customs tariffs and all bounties which may be
granted on production. Powers must be given to the
national Government to take over the existing debts
of the separate states, and in times of financial distress
to come to their assistance. On judicial and legal
questions&mdash;the nature of the federal courts, the
mechanism of appeal, the branches of law which are
suitable for federal jurisdiction&mdash;it is impossible to
speak; as it is premature to attempt an outline of the
constitution of the federal Government, the form of its
legislation, the functions of its executive. Such questions
require long and careful consideration on the
part of the South African colonies, and may happily
take their colour, when the time arrives, from some
accepted scheme of imperial federation. Two points
only may be noted as even now obvious desiderata of
policy. In Canada the state governors are appointed
by the federal Ministry; in Australia they are nominated
by the Crown in the same way as the Governor-General.
Experience has shown that the Australian
method is the superior one, since it allows a state
governor and his ministers to communicate directly
with the imperial Government, and so preserve a
formal independence which is at once harmless and
grateful to state pride. It is impossible to doubt that
the Australian precedent should be followed in South
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
Africa. The second point concerns the method of
effecting federation. The Canadian scheme was based
on resolutions drafted by a conference of delegates
at Quebec. They were approved by the legislatures
of the provinces, embodied in a bill drafted by a committee
of Canadian statesmen, and passed by the
imperial Government. Federation was thus, as in the
United States, the work of conferences and legislatures
alone. Australia, recognising that this was a question
which deeply concerned the population of the colonies,
followed a better plan. The federal constitution, after
passing through a long period of conferences and
examinations by state legislatures, was submitted to
a direct popular vote, and a certain majority was prescribed
for it in each state. Such a federation, secured
by the consent of a whole people, has a stability
against future attacks and captious emendation which
belongs to no scheme sanctioned only by a legislative
body. For though popular representation is in
theory a representation for all things, yet a matter
so vital in its application and so far-reaching in its
issues deserves to be made the subject of a special
mandate.</p>

<p>I have said that foreign affairs and army and navy
questions do not, under the ordinary practice of the
colonial system, have much connection with colonial
governments, and therefore may be left out of most
federal proposals. But though the technical last word
may never lie with the Federal Government, yet a
South African federation would have genuine foreign
interests, and would keep a watchful eye on the
movements of the colonising Powers of Europe. Had
there been a federation, there would have been no
German acquisition of Damaraland, nor would we
have found imperial authorities refusing the offer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
Lourengo Marques for a trifling sum. No colonist can
ever quite forgive those memorable blunders, which
prevented British South Africa from having that
geographical unity from the Zambesi to the Cape
which its interests demand. Thirty years ago it would
have been easy for Britain to proclaim a Monroe doctrine
for South Africa&mdash;for that matter of it, for East
Africa also. The opportunity has passed, but a strong
national Government could still exercise great influence
on foreign affairs, and prevent encroachment
upon Portuguese territories by that Power which
twenty years ago saw in Africa material for a new
German Empire and has never forgotten its grandiose
dreams, as well as keep an eye upon that dangerous
mushroom growth, the Congo Free State, and check
its glaring offences against civilisation. Army and
navy questions belong, in their broadest sense, to
schemes of imperial federation, a discussion of which
here would be out of place; but since there is already
in South Africa a large military force under one commander-in-chief,
certain army questions arise which
may find their proper answer only in federation, but
which even now require a provisional settlement.
According as we treat the matter, it may become a
unifying or a violently disjunctive force, a step towards
federation or a movement towards a wider disintegration.
The bearing of the army question on South
African policy is the subject of another chapter.</p>

The grounds of Australian federation are a useful parallel for South
Africa. I give Mr Bryce&rsquo;s list (&lsquo;Studies in History and
Jurisprudence,&rsquo;
vol. i. p. 478): &ldquo;The gain to trade and the general convenience to be
expected from abolishing the tariffs established on the frontiers of each
colony; the need for a common system of military defence; the advantages
of a common legislature for the regulation of railways and the fixing
of railway rates; the advantages of a common control of the larger rivers
for the purposes both of navigation and irrigation; the need for uniform
legislation on a number of commercial topics; the importance of finding
an authority competent to provide for old-age pensions and for the settlement
of labour disputes all over the country; the need for uniform provision
against the entry of coloured races (especially Chinese, Malays,
and Indian coolies); the gain to suitors from the establishment of a High
Court to entertain appeals and avoid the expense and delay involved in
carrying cases to the Privy Council in England; the probability that
money could be borrowed more easily on the credit of the Australian
Federation than by each colony for itself; the stimulus to be given to
industry and trade by substituting one great community for six smaller
ones; the possibility of making better arrangements for the disposal of
the unappropriated lands belonging to some of the colonies than could be
made by those colonies for themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<h4>THE ARMY AND SOUTH AFRICA.</h4>

<p>The foremost political lesson of the late war was the
solidarity of military spirit throughout the Empire.
But this cohesion is only in spirit, and the actual
position of colonial forces is that of isolated units,
connected in no system, and subject to no central
direction. For a student of military law, or that
branch of it which concerns the relation of military
forces to the civil power, a survey of the British
colonies has much curious interest. Speaking generally,
since 1868 there have been no imperial forces
in any self-governing colony, since we have acted
on the principle that when a colony became autonomous
the defence of its borders, except by sea, must
be left to its own government. Colonial troops are,
therefore, militia and volunteer, who take different
forms according to the needs of the colony. In
some the militia, or a part of it, is to all intents
a regular force, performing garrison duty and acting
as a school of instruction for the other auxiliary
forces. In Canada, for example, there were in 1902 a
troop of cavalry, a troop of mounted rifles, two batteries
of field artillery, two companies of garrison
artillery, and a battalion of infantry, in which the men
were enlisted for three years&rsquo; continuous service. In
New South Wales, to take one state of the Australian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
Commonwealth, provision was made for a permanent
force, which included a half-squadron of cavalry, three
companies of garrison artillery and one field battery,
a company of infantry and various supplementary
services, with men enlisted for five years. In New
Zealand the enlistment for the permanent force, which
consists of artillery and submarine miners, is for eight
years, three of which may be passed in the reserve.
Next comes the militia proper on the home model,
where the men are partially paid and are subject to a
certain amount of annual training. Lastly there is
a wide volunteer organisation, stretching from fully organised
companies of infantry and mounted rifles down
to small local rifle clubs. In certain colonies where
there is an aboriginal or unsettled population, such as
Canada, Cape Colony, and Natal, there is also a permanently
embodied police force, which may rank with
the permanent militia as a sort of colonial regulars.
All such forces are under the full control of the
Colonial Governments, whether, as in the Australian
Commonwealth and Canada, under the Federal
Ministry of Defence, or, as in Cape Colony, under the
department of the Prime Minister. An imperial officer
may be lent, as in Canada and Australia to-day, for the
command of the colonial force, but as soon as he enters
upon his command he becomes a servant of the Colonial
Government. To that Government alone belongs the
power of raising new forces, of changing the status of
existing troops, of ordering their distribution, of regulating
their rates of pay, and of lending them for service
beyond the colony. A strong general officer commanding
may have great influence in all such decisions, but
technically he is merely an adviser who receives his
orders from the local authorities.</p>

<p>This is one chief type of the organisation of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
over-sea imperial force. The other is furnished by
India. There we have a native Indian army, and
a large number of imperial troops, all of whom are
under the authority of the commander-in-chief in
India, who in turn is under the control of the
Indian Government. When imperial troops are
stationed in any other part of the Empire they are
commanded by an officer who is directly subject to
the War Office; but in India, as soon as a battalion
lands it takes the status of the local forces and
passes under the authority of the local government.
The War Office retains certain powers, but for all
practical purposes the Indian command is wholly
decentralised.</p>

<p>South Africa affords the spectacle of a confusion
of the two types. It is made up partly of Crown
colonies and dependencies and partly of self-governing
states. At this moment it is occupied by imperial
troops whose numbers, for the purpose of this argument,
may be put at 30,000. Such troops are
stationed in Cape Colony and Natal as well as in
the new colonies, and the command has been unified
and vested in one commander-in-chief, who is subject
only to the War Office and has no responsibility
to the local governments. We have, therefore, the
anomalous case of an autonomous colony occupied by
imperial troops, a policy which is out of line with
English practice. When self-government is given to
the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony, the
South African general will command what will be
neither more nor less than an alien army of occupation.
At the same time, wholly apart from the
regular forces, there are police troops in Natal, Cape
Colony, the new colonies, and Rhodesia; and a large
number of volunteer regiments, who are directly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
under the control of the local governments. The
South African military organisation is thus split
in two by a deep gulf, and unless some method of
union is found, we shall be confronted with a system
alien to the tradition of our colonial policy and in
itself clumsy and unworkable. But this question is
intimately bound up with others&mdash;the desirability
of the retention of imperial troops, the organisation
of such troops in relation to the imperial army,
indeed the whole question of that branch of imperial
federation which is concerned with the defence
of the Empire. It involves certain problems of
military reform which are violently contested by
good authorities. In this chapter it is proposed, as
far as possible, to consider the matter of the South
African army solely from the standpoint of South
African politics, referring to the military aspect
only in so far as may be necessary at points where
South African politics are merged in wider schemes
of imperial unity.</p>

<p>The first question concerns the policy of keeping
imperial troops in South Africa at all. The size of
the force depends, of course, on the duties which
it is intended to perform, but for the retention of
some troops there seems to be every justification.
Few people believe that there is much likelihood of
another outbreak, but after a war of the magnitude
of that which we have recently gone through it
would seem scarcely provident to leave the peace
of the country solely to the care of the police. In
a country, again, where British prestige is a plant
of recent growth, it is well to provide the moral
support of regular battalions. If useful for no other
purpose, they serve as a memento of war, a constant
reminder of the existence of an imperial power behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
all local administration. We have also to face the
fact that we have committed ourselves to some kind
of occupation force by undertaking a large preliminary
expenditure on cantonments, which will be money
wasted if the scheme is dropped. For this purpose
we have spent between two and three millions, and
unless we are to be held guilty of causeless extravagance,
we must abide by the plan to which this
outlay has committed us.</p>

<p>The original scheme was for a garrison force. For
this purpose 30,000 men are too many if our forecast
be correct, and far too few if it be wrong. Half the
number would be ample for any peace establishment,
and we may be perfectly certain that as soon as self-government
is declared in the new colonies there
would be many attempts to cut down the number or
do away with the force altogether. Alien garrison
troops will be always unpopular, and, as has been said,
they are foreign to British policy with regard to
autonomous colonies. A force on the garrison basis
would find itself with little to do, the general commanding
would be exposed to the jealousy of the
colonial troops, and involved in constant difficulties
with the colonial governments, and, save in the unlikely
event of a rebellion, would have no very obvious
justification for the existence of his command.</p>

<p>If South Africa is to remain a station for any considerable
number of imperial troops, some mode of
co-operation must be discovered with the local governments.
This co-operation would be possible between
the colonial administration and a garrison force; but
it would be infinitely more satisfactory if the whole
status of the imperial troops were changed. For a
garrison establishment makes it difficult, if not impossible,
not only to bring the general commanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
into touch with the governments, but to bring the
local troops into line with the regular, and both unions
must be accomplished before any satisfactory settlement
can be given to the problem. The simplest
solution was to treat the South African force, not as a
garrison, but as part of the regular army on the home
establishment, sent there for the purpose of training,
and liable to be utilised at any moment for active
service in any part of the Empire. There are certain
objections to the scheme, plausible enough though not
insuperable, from the military standpoint; but for the
present we may limit our argument to those points
which concern South Africa, and those difficulties
which spring from the nature of the country&mdash;difficulties
which are far more real to the soldiers who are
directly concerned than the wider question of the
present scheme of military organisation.</p>

<p>The advantages are sufficiently obvious. There are
few finer man&oelig;uvring grounds in the world than the
great Central South African tableland. There is
sufficient cover to make scouting possible and not
enough to make it easy, and the intense clearness of
the air and its singular acoustic properties will train
a man&rsquo;s senses to a perfection unknown in other
armies and impossible to acquire in the restricted
areas of a populous country. The soldier will have
to face the rudiments of war in a far more difficult
country than he is likely to be used in. He will learn
to shoot, or rather to judge ranges correctly under
unwonted conditions, which is rarer and more vital
than mere accurate marksmanship. He will learn
the real roughness of campaigning in long man&oelig;uvres;
and from the same cause regiments will acquire that
elasticity and cohesion which come from constant
working together. If we except enteric, caused by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
bad sanitation, which has been the curse of the war,
but is not a speciality of the country, the veld is
almost exempt from diseases. Life there will not only
train the senses and the intelligence, but will give
health and physical stamina. A year of such training
will make a man of the young recruit from the slums
of an English city. Physique is the final determinant
in war, and with our present system of recruiting and
training there is no guarantee for its existence. Lastly,
our soldiers trained on the veld will become natural
horse masters, which few even of the cavalry are at
present. They will learn that care of their horses
which every Boer has as a birthright, that simple
veterinary skill and common-sense whose lack has cost
us so many millions. South Africa is a natural horse-breeding
country, and in co-operation with Government
stud-farms a breed of remounts could be got
which would unite the merits of the Afrikander pony
with the weight and bone required for army work.
Instead of having to ransack foreign countries for our
horses, we should breed all we wanted for ourselves
under the eye of our imperial officers, and breed them
too in a place which is the best centre in the Empire
for distribution to any possible seat of war.</p>

<p>The objections to the scheme are partly of sentiment
and partly of technical difficulties. South
African service, it is said, is at present unpopular.
Our army has recently concluded a long and arduous
war, fought under conditions of extreme discomfort.
Small wonder if troops who have been kicking their
heels for eighteen months in remote blockhouses
should have little good to say of the pleasures of the
life. For the officers there have been dismal quarters,
a cheerless dusty country, heavy expenses, little sport,
and no society; and the lot of the men, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
relatively less hard, has been equally comfortless.
The proper answer to such a contention is to ignore
it. It is the objection of the non-professional officer,
and cannot be entertained. The forces in South
Africa are sent there for training, not for garrison
life, and if the place is a good training-ground, the
question of congenial society and interesting recreation
has nothing to do with the matter.<a name="FNanchor_38_38"
id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> But
there
is no reason why South African life for the future
should be unattractive. An English society is rapidly
arising, English sports are becoming popular, the
cantonments can easily be made comfortable homes,
and there are a thousand ways, such as the allotting
to each soldier who desires it a small patch of land to
cultivate, in which the men can be made to feel an
interest in the country. For the officers there is a
sporting hinterland as fine and as accessible as the
Pamirs to the Indian sportsman. Living is undoubtedly
more costly, and there will have to be
special allowances for South African service; but with
a proper canteen system, such as existed during the
war, the cost of luxuries might be kept low enough
for all. There is a future, too, for the reservist which
he cannot look for at home. Even as an unskilled
workman he can command wages which are unknown
in England; and the men who, at the end of their
three years&rsquo; service, would join the South African
reserve, would be young enough to begin civil life in
whatever walk they might choose.</p>

<p>The chief technical difficulties, exclusive of sea-transport,
which is outside our review, are the extra
cost, the difficulty of recruiting, and the delays in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
bringing reservists from home in case of active service.
The last will be met in a little while by the creation
of a South African reserve; but in the meantime
there are many ways in which it might be surmounted.
Battalions might be brought up to fighting
strength by the inclusion of men from local forces.
It would be an easy matter to introduce into the
terms of enlistment of the South African Constabulary
a condition of foreign service, and to keep from 1000
to 2000 men in readiness. It would be possible also
to enlist 1000 men of the Transvaal volunteer force
for special foreign service, paying to each man a bonus
of #12 per annum. The real solution of this difficulty
is bound up, as we shall see later, with the whole
theory of a colonial army; but even on the present
system it is easy to provide a working expedient.
The question of extra cost&mdash;for each man would
require an extra 6d. per day, or #9, 2s. 6d. per
annum&mdash;is answered by pointing out that such a
force being on the home establishment would do
away with the necessity of linked battalions, and
would effect a saving of twenty-four battalions and
six regiments of cavalry, so that even if the extra
cost were 50 per cent, the total saving would far
outbalance it.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a
href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The recruiting difficulty is
unlikely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
to be a serious one. We may lose to the army a
little of the loose fringe of half-grown boys from the
towns,&mdash;stuff which, as history has shown, can be
transformed into excellent fighting men, but which
at the same time does not represent the last word
either in moral or physical qualities. But many of
the best of our young men, whose thoughts turn
naturally to the colonies, would gladly seize the
chance of three years&rsquo; service there, in which they
would gain experience of the new lands, and be able
to judge, when their turn came for entering reserves,
which line of life promised most. No Emigration
Bureau or Settlement Board would be so effective
an agency in bringing the right class to the country.
But, further, such a system would throw open to us
the vast recruiting-grounds of our colonies. It is
difficult for one who has not been brought face to face
with it to realise the military enthusiasm which the
war has kindled not only among the more inflammable,
but among the coolest and shrewdest of our younger
colonists. They know&mdash;none better&mdash;the joints in
our armour; but they have paid generous tribute to
the solidarity of spirit, the gallantry of our leaders,
the unbreakable constancy of our men. A few fanciful
war correspondents have done a gross injustice to our
colonial soldiers by painting them as a race of capable
braggarts, who laughed at our incompetence in a
game which they understood so vastly better. It
is safe to say that in the better class there was no
hint of such a spirit; and the way in which irregular
horse, with fine records of service, have traced the
source of victory in the last resort to the stamina
of the British infantry, does credit both to their
judgment and their chivalry. They have become
keen critics of any organisation, looking at war not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
only with the eyes of fighting men but of professional
soldiers. All the details of the profession are of interest
to them, and an imperial force in South Africa
could draw largely both for officers and men upon
the local population. The benefit of such a result,
both to the colonies and to ourselves, is difficult to
over-estimate. A common profession would do much
to smooth away the petty differences which are always
apt to widen out gulfs. The army would
become a vast nursery of the true imperial spirit,
and a school to perpetuate the best of our English
traditions; and would itself gain incalculably by the
infusion of new and virile blood, and the weakening
of prejudices, both of class and education, which at
present are a grave menace to its efficiency.</p>

<p class="smlpadt">If the imperial Government accept the retention of
a South African Army Corps as part of the home
establishment, it is worth while considering how best
this new departure in army policy can be used to
further the interests of South Africa herself, and
those wider imperial interests which are daily taking
concrete shape and casting their shadow over local
politics. Leaving for a moment the question of imperial
forces, we find in South Africa a local military
activity which, though less completely organised than
in some of the older colonies, is yet well worth our
reckoning with. The war brought into being a large
number of irregular corps, most of which have now
disappeared. In Cape Colony the permanent force
is the Cape Mounted Rifles, which has an average
strength of 1000 men, enlisted for five years, and
sworn to &ldquo;act as a police force throughout the
colony, and also as a military force for the defence
of the colony.&rdquo; Since the war the town guards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
and district mounted troops, the former limited to
10,000 and the latter to 5000 men, have been
placed on a permanent footing. They are loosely
organised volunteer forces, enlisted for no fixed
period, and bound to serve in the one case in
the neighbourhood of the towns, and in the other
within their own districts. There are also a number
of ordinary volunteer corps, composed chiefly of
mounted infantry, and field and garrison artillery,
and a number of mounted rifle clubs for local defence.
All types of corps included, there are probably not
less than 20,000 men undergoing some kind of
military training and pledged to some form of service
in Cape Colony alone. Natal presents a very similar
picture. Her regulars are the Natal Police Force,
with a strength, including the Zululand Police, of
between 500 and 600 men, enlisted for three years,
and including both mounted and foot divisions.
There is a considerable volunteer force, with artillery,
infantry, and mounted rifles, two companies of naval
volunteers, and a number of rifle clubs with a strength
of over 2000. We may put the defensive strength of
Natal, which, considering her size, is remarkable, at
a little under 5000 men. The British South African
Police, which is stationed in Southern Rhodesia, has
a strength of a little over 500, and the Southern
Rhodesia Constabulary and volunteers increase the
forces of that district to nearly 2000 men. In the
new colonies the chief force is the South African
Constabulary, with a nominal strength of 6000 men,
of which two-thirds are stationed in the Transvaal.
It is an expensive force, each man costing on an
average #250 per annum; but there is reason to
believe that the figure may soon be reduced to #200,
or even less. In the Transvaal a volunteer force
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
has been organised of nine regiments. No ultimate
strength has been fixed, but 10,000 may be taken as
a fair estimate. In April 1903 the force numbered
fully 3000, and as the country becomes more populous
there is little reason to doubt that the maximum will
be reached.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a
href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>There is thus a force of over 40,000 men engaged
in local defence throughout South Africa, and of this
the 8000 police are for all practical purposes regular
troops. At the present moment the command of this
force is split up among the different colonial governments
and is wholly dissociated from any connection
with the command of the imperial regulars. We have
seen that the situation is full of grave difficulties for
the regulars themselves, since there is no place in
colonial policy for an alien garrison force. But the
strongest argument in the present system lies not
in the difficulties which it involves but in the advantages
which it forgoes. We have in South Africa a
population which, to use Napier&rsquo;s famous distinction,
is not only bellicose but martial, with a natural aptitude
for soldiering and a keen interest in all details
of military organisation. Until the regular command
is brought into line with the local forces this genius
will expend itself on casual volunteering, and when
we next call for colonial aid we shall have the same
haphazard units, instead of colonial regiments drilled
and man&oelig;uvred on one system and forming a part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
some regular division. The arguments for a federation
of the whole South African command are difficult
to meet, and there is little danger of opposition
from the local governments. The danger lies in the
fact that it would necessarily involve some reconstruction
of our whole military system, and military
conservatism is slow to depart from the traditions of
the elders.</p>

<p>If imperial defence means anything it must include
the provision in every great colonial unit, in Canada,
Australia, South Africa,&mdash;particularly in South Africa,&mdash;of
a force on the lines of the Indian army, with
an elastic organisation, embracing both imperial regulars
and local troops. Granted the sanction of the
imperial Government, there is no special difficulty in
the machinery required to create it. If South Africa
were federated it would be simplicity itself. All that
would be wanted would be to bring the general officer
commanding the imperial troops, since his command
has been unified, into relation with the Federal Ministry
of Defence, and unite in his person the functions
which Sir Neville Lyttelton now exercises in South
Africa and those which at present belong to Lord
Dundonald in Canada. But, pending federation, we
must have recourse to one of those intercolonial
representative bodies which form the thin end of
the federal wedge. The general commanding would
be given the command of local forces by an act
of the local legislature, subject in all questions of
policy, finance, and organisation to the authority of
an intercolonial committee of defence.<a name="FNanchor_41_41"
id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Each colony
would elect two or more representatives, on the lines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
of the present Intercolonial Council of the Transvaal
and Orange River Colony; the council thus formed
would be empowered by the legislatures which elect
it to decide what share of the cost was to be borne by
the separate colonies, to arrange for combined man&oelig;uvres,
to supervise appointments, and, in case of
local wars, to decide what force should be sent to the
front, and in the event of an imperial war, to say
what local forces should be lent for service. The
general commanding would be responsible to the War
Office for moving imperial troops, subject to its
direction, and for the internal discipline and organisation
of the imperial divisions. There would, thus,
be clearly defined limits of authority for both the
imperial and local Governments, and at the same
time every inducement to co-operation. In so far as
he was in command of the whole of the South African
forces, the general commanding would be subject in
South African matters to the defence committee;
while, in so far as he was in command of imperial
troops, he would take his orders on imperial questions,
such as a foreign war, from the Home Government.
The present officers in command of colonial police and
volunteers would, of course, come under his authority
precisely on the same basis as officers of regulars.</p>

<p>The advantages of such a scheme are many, both
from the standpoint of policy and of military efficiency.
It would please the colonies, who would have
an army of their own, drilled on regular lines and
affiliated to the imperial army, and at the same time
would feel that they had a share in the control of the
forces and the military policy of the Empire. It
would ensure the efficiency of local troops, and would
prepare them for co-operation with the regulars,&mdash;not
the clumsy partnership of troops tagged on to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
a division which cannot use them, but the true co-operation
which follows on absorption in a larger unit
with which they have been trained. It would provide
an easy means for the transfer of colonial officers to
imperial regiments, and would act as a magnet for
colonial recruiting. In the case of local wars, as I
have said, the whole force would be ready to take
the field under the orders of the general commanding.
In the case of a foreign war the imperial Government
would direct the distribution of the regulars, and it
would be for the committee of defence to say what
local troops should be lent for foreign service.<a name="FNanchor_42_42"
id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Beyond this, the only duties of the War Office
would lie in the selection of staff officers and the
general commanding&mdash;a matter in which the concurrence
of the colonial governments might be obtained
as a matter of courtesy. On the financial side
it is probable that the scheme would considerably
lessen the burden of defence. The only way in which
the colonies can ever be expected to contribute to the
cost of imperial defence is by providing armies and
navies of their own. To pay for that which does not
directly concern you is a form of tax, and so hostile
to the letter and spirit of our colonial traditions.
But if local governments are given a direct interest
in an imperial army in which their own troops are
subsumed, and whose policy they largely control, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
do not think they will be ungenerous. There is no
reason why they should not meet the cost of the
general and his staff, and contribute part, if not the
whole, of the extra pay which the regular troops
in the South African command must receive, and the
bonus to the volunteer corps which are held ready
for foreign service. Such payments, once the federation
were effected, would no doubt come as a spontaneous
offer. Decentralisation and centralisation are,
by way of becoming catchwords, repeated without
understanding to justify the most diverse schemes.
But every true policy must include both, since in
certain matters it is well to decentralise, and in
others unification is imperative. Such a scheme as
has been sketched combines the sporadic colonial
forces in one effective unit of organisation, and at
the same time relieves the tension at imperial headquarters
by relegating detailed administration to the
local authorities, who are best fitted to supervise.</p>

<p>The military is, as a rule, the most difficult aspect
of a federation, but in our circumstances it is likely
to be the simplest. We have a federal nucleus in
the imperial command, and a strong impulse in the
fact that the local volunteer and police forces have
already served side by side with regulars in the field,
and are inspired with a military spirit which may
soon disappear unless fostered and utilised. A federation
of local forces exists in Canada and in the
Australian Commonwealth; a union of the imperial
forces exists in South Africa. The problem is to
federate the local forces in advance of a political
federation, and to unite them with the imperial
command in a system which, though a new departure
in military policy, contains no detail which has not
been somewhere or other already conceded. If the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
scheme in itself is worth anything, the practical
difficulties are small. It is unlikely that the colonial
governments will offer any opposition; and so far as
South African interests are concerned, the foundations
would be laid of a true federation. From the point
of view of imperial politics the step would have an
even greater significance, for a type would be created
of a new army organisation which would provide
for a federated imperial defence; and the precedent
having once been created, the other colonies would
readily follow suit.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_38_38" id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_38_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a>
The final answer to this objection would be the reorganisation of
the militia&mdash;the only force for home defence&mdash;and the release of the
present regular army for service over-sea.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a>
I have thought it unnecessary to recapitulate in detail the financial
argument used by advocates of this policy. Roughly it is as follows:
The present Army Corps system provides for 78 battalions at home,
66 in India, and 12 in South Africa&mdash;a total of 156. The proposed
system provides for 42 at home, 24 in South Africa, and 66 in India&mdash;a
total of 132. There is thus a saving of 24 battalions, besides 6 regiments
of cavalry.</p>

The details of the force may be of interest. In April 1903 it consisted
of two regiments of the Imperial Light Horse, one regiment of the
South African Light Horse, one regiment of the Johannesburg Mounted
Rifles, one regiment of the Scottish Horse, one regiment of the Central
South African Railway Volunteers, one regiment of the Transvaal Light
Infantry, one regiment of Transvaal Scottish, one regiment of Railway
Pioneers, a medical staff corps, and a headquarters&rsquo; staff. The names of
some of the most famous irregular corps are thus perpetuated. A new
regiment&mdash;the Northern Rifles&mdash;has recently been formed at
Pretoria.</p>

This scheme would involve a departure from the present military
organisation on the basis of army corps. We cannot expect to get an
army corps for each colonial district, and the advantages disappear if
such reinforcements are to be distributed to make up the strength of
the army corps drawn from the whole Empire. The unit must be
smaller&mdash;something in the nature of a division of, say, three brigades with
one brigade of mounted troops. In South Africa we could have several
divisions of regulars and several of local troops. The system would have
the merit of harmonising with the organisation of the army in India,
where reinforcements are most likely to be required.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<h4>THE FUTURE OUTLOOK.</h4>

<p>The problems discussed in the foregoing chapters
have been concerned chiefly with the new colonies,
for it is to them that we must look for the motive
force to expedite union. They must long continue to
be the most important factor in British South Africa,
partly from their accidental position as the late theatre
of war, and more especially from their wealth, the
intricacy of their politics, the high level of ability
among their inhabitants, the splendid chances of their
future, and the delicacy of their present status. Union,
if it comes, will come chiefly because of them; and in
any union they will play a great, if not a dominant,
part. Whither they pipe, South Africa must ultimately
follow. But this is not because there can be
any differentiation in value between the states, since
all are self-subsistent and independent, but because in
the new colonies the problems which chiefly concern
South Africa&rsquo;s future are already naked to the eye
and focussed for observation. The Transvaal will be
important because within it the fight which concerns
the whole future of the African colony will be fought
to a finish. It will add to the problem some features
which concern only itself, but the general lines it
shares with its neighbours. The economic strife, the
amalgamation of races, the native question, the movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
towards federation, with all its many aspects,
and, last but not least, the intellectual and political
development of its citizens,&mdash;this is the problem of the
Transvaal, and in the gravest sense it is the problem
of South Africa&rsquo;s future.</p>

<p>In the preceding pages the separate questions have
been briefly considered. But here we may note one
truth which attaches to them all&mdash;the settlement of
no single one is easy. Each will defy a supine statesmanship,
and in each failure will be attended with
serious disaster. Patience and a lithe intelligence
can alone ensure success, and it is doubtful if that
happy Providence which has now and then taken
charge of our drifting and muddling will interfere
in this province to save us from the consequences of
folly. Every question stands on a needle-point.
Mining development&mdash;if the wealth of the country is
to be properly exploited&mdash;must continue as it has
begun, utilising the highest engineering talent, and
straining every nerve to extend the area over which
profits can be made. The labour question requires
tact and patience, prescience of future interests, a
recognition of the needs of the complex organism
of which it is but one aspect. The native question
shows the same narrow margin between success and
failure, and demands a degree of forethought and
statesmanship which would be an exorbitant requirement
were it not so vital a part of the social and
economic future. Agriculture and settlement can
only be made valuable by a close study of facts, and
an intelligence which can correctly estimate data and
bring to bear on them the latest results of experimental
science. Finally, in its financial aspects the
problem has a near resemblance to the most complicated
of recent economic tasks, the re-settlement of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
Egypt. Burdened with a heavy debt, the country is
speculating on its future and living on its capital.
For the next few years it will in all likelihood
achieve solvency; but the margin may be small,
and the result may be secured only by the retention
of certain revenue-producing charges at an unnatural
figure. A considerable part of the debt will be applied
to services which will make a good return in time, but
for a little while revenue may barely cover disbursements.
In finance, above all other provinces, there is
need of a severe economy, coupled with a clear recognition
of the country&rsquo;s needs and a judicious courage.
It is a gamble, if you like, but with sleepless and
ubiquitous watchfulness the odds are greatly in our
favour. The very forces which fight against us, the
complexity of economic and social interests, will
become our servants, if properly understood, and will
solidify and preserve our work, as the house fashioned
of granite will stand when the building of sandstone
will crumble. The shaping force of intelligence
remains the one thing needful. Of high and just
intentions there can be little doubt, but in the new
South Africa we are more likely to be perplexed by
the fool than the knave. Will the result, as Cromwell
asked long ago, be &ldquo;answerable to the simplicity
and honesty of the design&rdquo;? Neither to the one
nor the other, but to that rarer endowment, political
wisdom.</p>

<p>So much for administrative problems. A country
whose future is staked upon the intelligence of its
Government and its people is an exhilarating spectacle
to the better type of man. England has succeeded
before on the same postulates and in harder circumstances.
But there are certain subtler aspects of
development, where the same high qualities are necessary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
but where the end to be striven for is less clear.
There is the fusion of the two races, an ideal if not a
practical necessity. As has been said, a political union
already exists after a fashion. There seems little
reason to fear any future disruption, for on the
material side Dutch interests are ours, and all are
vitally concerned in the common prosperity. Administrative
efficiency will make the Boer acquiesce
in any form of government. But that which Lord
Durham thought far more formidable, &ldquo;a struggle not
of principles but of races,&rdquo; may continue for long in
other departments than politics, unless we use extraordinary
caution in our methods. The very advance
of civilisation may militate against us by vivifying
historical memories and rekindling a clearer flame of
racial resentment. The Dutch have their own ideals,
different from ours, but not incompatible with complete
political union. Any attempt to do violence to their
ideals, or any hasty and unconsidered imposition of
unsuitable English forms, will throw back that work of
spiritual incorporation which is the highest destiny of
the country. They have a strong Church and a strong
creed, certain educational ideas and social institutions
which must long remain powers in the land. And let
us remember that any South African civilisation must
grow up on the soil, and must borrow much from the
Dutch race, else it is no true growth but a frail exotic.
It will borrow English principles but not English institutions,
since, while principles are grafts from human
needs, institutions are the incrusted mosses of time
which do not bear transplanting. It is idle to talk
of universities such as Oxford, or public schools like
Winchester, and any attempt to tend such alien plants
will be a waste of money and time. South Africa will
create her own nurseries, and on very different lines.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
If we are burdened in our work with false parallels we
shall fail, for nothing in the new country can survive
which is not based on a clear-sighted survey of things
as they are, and a renunciation of old formulas. Let
us recognise that we cannot fuse the races by destroying
the sacred places of one of them, but only by
giving to the future generations some common heritage.
&ldquo;If you unscotch us,&rdquo; wrote Sir Walter Scott to
Croker, &ldquo;you will find us damned mischievous Englishmen,&rdquo;
and it will be a very mischievous Dutchman
who is coerced into unsuitable English ways and
taught sentiments of which he has no understanding.
When a people arise who have a common culture
bequeathed from their fathers, and who look back
upon Ladysmith and Colenso, the Great Trek and the
Peninsular War, as incidents in a common pedigree,
then we shall have fusion indeed, a union in spirit and
in truth. Nothing which has in it the stuff of life can
ever die, and there is something of this vitality in the
Dutch tradition. Our own is stronger, wider, resting
on greater historical foundations, and therefore it will
more readily attract and absorb the lesser. But the
lesser will live, transformed, indeed, but none the less
a real part of the spiritual heritage of a nation where
there will be no racial cleavage. The consummation is
not yet, and, maybe, will be long delayed. It will not
be in our time; perhaps our sons may see it; certainly,
I think, our grandchildren will be very near it.
Such a development cannot be artificially hastened,
and all that we can do is to see that no barriers of our
own making are allowed to intervene. Meantime we
have a <i>de facto</i> political union to make the most of.</p>

<p>What manner of men are the citizens of this new
nation to be? They will have the vigour which
belongs to colonial parentage, the freshness of outlook
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
and freedom from old shibboleths. But they
should have more. They start as no colony has
ever started, with the echoes of a great war still
in their ears, with a highly developed industry and
the chances of great wealth, and with a population
showing as high a level of intelligence as any in
the world. The nature of their problem will compel
them to remain intellectually active, and as the eyes
of the world are on them they will have few temptations
to lethargy. They may take foolish steps and
be beguiled into rash experiments, but I do not think
they will stagnate. And for this people so much alive
there is the chance of an indigenous culture, born
of the old, when they have leisure to make it theirs,
and the freshening influences of their new land and
their strenuous life. South Africa cannot help herself.
She must play a large part in imperial politics;
her views on economic questions will be listened to
by all the world; a political future, good or bad,
she must accept and make the most of. But behind
it all there is the prospect of that intimate self-development,
that progress in thought, in the arts,
in the amenities of life, which, like righteousness,
exalteth a nation. The finest of all experiments is
to unite an older civilisation with the natural freshness
of a virgin soil, and she, alone among the colonies
which have ever been founded, has the power to make
it. Not only is it a new land, but it is Africa,
a corner of that mysterious continent to which the
eyes of dreamers and adventurers have always turned.
The boundaries of the unknown are shrinking daily,
and where our forefathers marked only lions and
behemoths on the map, we set down a hundred
names and a dozen trading stations. The winds
which blow from the hills of the north tell no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
longer of mystic interior kingdoms and uncounted
treasures. We know most things nowadays, and
have given our knowledge the prosaic form of joint-stock
companies. But the proverb still justifies itself.<a name="FNanchor_43_43"
id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Africa is still a home of the incalculable, not wholly
explored or explorable, still a hinterland to which
the youth of the south can push forward in search
of fortune, and from which that breath of romance,
which is the life of the English race, can inspire
thinkers and song-makers. Girdled on three sides
by the ocean, and on the fourth looking north to
the inland seas and the eternal snows of Ruwenzori&mdash;I
can imagine no nobler cradle for a race. I have
said that a structure built with difficulty is the most
lasting. Her complex problems will knit together
the sinews of intelligence and national character,
and the great commonplaces of policy, so eternally
true, so inexorable in their application, will become
part of her creed, not from lip-service but from the
sweat and toil of practical work. If to these she
can add other commonplaces, still older and more
abiding, of civic duty, of the intellectual life, of
moral purpose, she will present to history that most
rare and formidable of combinations, intellect and
vitality, will and reason, culture guiding and inspiring
an unhesitating gift for action.</p>

<p>There is already a school of political thought in
South Africa, a small school, and thus far so ill-defined
that it has no common programme to put
before a world which barely recognises its existence.
It owes its inspiration to Mr Rhodes, but its founder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
left it no legacy of doctrine beyond a certain instinct
for great things, a fire of imagination, and a brooding
energy. Its members are very practical men,
landowners, mine-owners, rich, capable, with nothing
of the ideologue in their air, the last people one
would naturally go to for ambitions which could not
be easily reduced to pounds sterling. But they are
of the school: at heart they are pioneers, the cyclopean
architects of new lands. It is one of South
Africa&rsquo;s paradoxes that there should exist among
successful and matter-of-fact men of business a
hungry fidelity to ideals for which we look in vain
among the doctrinaires who do them facile homage.
And they are also very practical in their aims. Mr
Rhodes never desired a paper empire or that vague
thing called territorial prestige. What filled his
imagination was the thought of new nations of our
blood living a free and wholesome life and turning
the wilderness into a habitable place. He strove
not for profit but for citizens, for a breathing-space,
a playground, for the future. The faults of his
methods and the imperfections of his aims, which
are so curiously our own English faults and imperfections,
may have hindered the realisation of his
dreams, but they did not impair that legacy of
daimonic force which he left to his countrymen.
You may find it in South Africa to-day, and if you
rightly understand it and feel its hidden movements
you will be aghast at your own parochialism. It is
slow and patient, knowing that &ldquo;the counsels to
which Time hath not been called Time will not
ratify.&rdquo; But with Time on its side it is confident,
and it will not easily be thwarted.</p>

<p>Excursions in colonial psychology are rarely illuminating,
lacking as a rule both sympathy and knowledge;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
but on one trait there is a singular unanimity. The
two chief obstacles to imperial unity, so runs a saying,
are the bumptious colonial and the supercilious Englishman.
I readily grant the latter, but is the first
fairly described? A colonist is naturally prone to
self-assertion in certain walks of life. If he creates
an industry alone and from the start in the teeth
of hardships, having had to begin from the very beginning,
he is apt to lose perspective and unduly
magnify his work. If he owns a bakery, it is the
finest in the world, at any rate in the British Empire.
He compares his doings with his neighbours&rsquo; within
his limited horizon, and he is scarcely to be blamed if
he brags a little. His bravado is only ridiculous when
taken out of its surroundings, and at the worst is more
a mannerism than an affection of mind. But on the
intellectual side he is, in my judgment, conspicuously
humble, a groper after the viewless things whose
omnipotence he feels dimly. To the home-bred man
history is a commonplace to be taken for granted; to
the colonist who has shaped a workaday life from the
wilds, it is a vast mother of mystery. Traditions,
customs, standards staled to us by the vain emphasis
of generations, rise before him as revelations and
shrines of immortal wisdom. What to us is rhetoric
is to him the finest poetry; and for this reason in
politics he is prone to follow imaginative schemes,
without testing them by his native caution. Our
somewhat weary intellectual world is a temple which
he is ready to approach with uncovered head. It is
not mere innocence, but rather, I think, that freshness
of outlook and optimism which he gathers from his
new land and his contact with the beginnings of
things. Truth and beauty remain the same: it is
only the symbols and the mirrors which grow dim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
with time; and to the man who is sufficiently near to
understand the symbols, and sufficiently aloof to see
no flaw or tawdriness, there is a double share of happiness.
The superficial assurance, the &ldquo;bumptiousness&rdquo;
of the saying, is surely a small matter if behind it
there is this true modesty of spirit.</p>

<p>A national life presumes union, but South African
federation is simply a step to a larger goal. It may
be objected that in the foregoing chapters the cardinal
problem is treated as less the fusion of the two races
than the development of South Africa on certain lines
within our colonial system. Such has been the intention
of the book. The Dutch have accepted the new
<i>rigime</i>; they will fight, if they fight, on constitutional
lines under our fgis and within our Empire, and in a
sense it may be said that racial union on the political
side already exists. But the further political development
of the country, as self-consciousness is slowly
gained&mdash;that, indeed, is a matter on which hang great
issues, good or bad, for the English people. Because the
furnace has been so hot, the metal will emerge pure or
it will not emerge at all. A new colony, or rather a
new nation, will have been created, or another will have
been added to the catalogue of our infrequent failures,
and the loose territorial mass known as South Africa
will become the prey of any wandering demagogue or
aspiring foreign Power. Our late opponents will take
their revenge, if they seek it, not by reviving the
impossible creed of Dutch supremacy, but by retarding
South Africa from what is her highest destiny and her
worthiest line of development. Her future, if she will
accept it, is to be a pioneer in imperial federation: a
pioneer, because she has felt more than any other
colony the evils of disintegration, the vices of the old
colonial system, the insecurity of government from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
above, and at the same time is in a position to realise
the weakness of that independence which is also isolation.
This is not the place to enter upon so vast a
question. To many it is the greatest of modern political
dreams. Without it imperialism becomes empty
rhetoric and braggadocio, a tissue of dessicated phrases,
worthy of the worst accusations with which its enemies
have assailed it. Without it our Empire is neither
secure from aggression nor politically sound nor commercially
solvent. Within it alone can any true scheme
of common defence be realised. Moreover, it is the
glamour needed to give to colonial politics that wider
imaginative outlook which England enjoys in virtue of
a long descent. Colonial politics tend to become at
times narrow and provincial; in a federation they would
gain that larger view and ampler pride which a man
feels who, believing himself to be humbly born, learns
for the first time that he is the scion of a famous house.
Their kinship, instead of the long-remembered sentiment
of a descendant, would become the intimate
loyalty of a colleague. And home politics also would
lose the provincialism, equally vicious, if historically
more interesting, which lies somewhere near the root
of our gravest errors, and in relinquishing a facile
imperialism find an empire which needs no rhetoric
to enhance its splendour.</p>

<p>But before South Africa can become an ally in
federation she must make her peace with herself. If
it is difficult to exaggerate the need for untiring intelligence
in the making of this peace, it is even harder
to over-estimate the profound significance which her
success or failure in the task of self-realisation has for
the prestige of our race. Our colonial methods are
on trial in a sphere where all the world can watch.
And while our aim is a colony, the means must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
different from those which we have hitherto used in
our expansion. A nascent colony was neglected till
it asserted itself and appeared already mature on the
political horizon. But in the growth of this colony
England must play a direct part, since for good or for
ill her destinies are linked with it, and supineness and
a foolish interference will equally bring disaster. There
is one parallel, not indeed in political conditions, but
in the qualities required for the shaping of the country.
If we can show in South Africa that spirit of sleepless
intelligence which has created British India, then there
is nothing to fear. For, as I understand history, India
was made by Englishmen who brought to the task
three qualities above others. The first was a wide
toleration for local customs and religions&mdash;a desire to
leave the national life intact, and to mould it slowly
by those forces of enlightenment in which sincerely, if
undogmatically, they believed. The second was the
extension of rigorous justice and full civil rights to
every subject, a policy which in the long-run is the
only means of bringing a subject race into the life of
the State. Last, and most vital of all, they showed in
their work a complete efficiency, proving themselves
better statesmen, financiers, jurists, soldiers, than any
class they had superseded. This efficiency is the key-note
of the South African problem, so far as concerns
British interests. If the imperial Power shows itself
inspired with energy, acumen, a clear-eyed perception
of truth as well as with its traditional honesty of purpose,
South Africa will gladly follow where it may
lead. But she will be quick to criticise formalism and
intolerant of a fumbling incapacity.</p>

<p><i>Sed nondum est finis.</i> We stand at the beginning
of a new path, and it is impossible to tell whither it
may lead, what dark fords and stony places it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
pass through, and in what sandy desert or green champaign
it may end. Political prophecy is an idle occupation.
American observers on the eve of the French
Revolution saw England on the verge of anarchy and
France a contented country under a beloved king.
Even so acute a writer as de Tocqueville assumed
that America would continue an agricultural country
without manufactures, and that the fortunes of her
citizens would be small. If philosophers may err, it
is well for a humble writer to be modest in his conclusions.
In the past pages an effort has been made
neither to minimise the difficulties nor to over-estimate
the chances of South African prosperity. &ldquo;Whosoever,&rdquo;
said Ralegh, &ldquo;in writing a modern history shall
follow truth too near the heels, it may haply strike
out his teeth.&rdquo; I can ask for no better fate than to
see all my forecasts falsified, the dangers proved to
have no existence, the chances shown a thousandfold
more roseate. But whatever may be the destiny of
this or that observation, there can be no dispute, I
think, upon the gravity of the problem and the profound
importance of its wise settlement. And when
all is said that can be said it is permissible to import
into our view a little of that ancestral optimism which
has hitherto kept our hearts high in our checkered
history, for optimism, when buttressed by intelligence,
is but another name for courage. There is an optimism
more merciless than any pessimism, which, seeing
clearly all the perils and discouragements, the hollowness
of smooth conventional counsels and the dreary
list of past errors, can yet pluck up heart to believe
that there is no work too hard for the English race
when its purpose is firm and its intelligence awakened.
With this belief we may well look forward to a day
when the old unhappy things will have become far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
off and forgotten, and South Africa, at peace with herself,
will be the leader in a new and pregnant imperial
policy; and the words of the poet of another empire
will be true in a nobler and ampler sense of ours,
&ldquo;They who drink of the Rhone and the Orontes are
all one nation.&rdquo;</p>
