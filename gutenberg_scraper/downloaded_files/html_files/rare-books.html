Important Books</b></font></p>
<p>A list of rare ands important books which have been converted
to ebooks. As producers of ebooks, we at Project Gutenberg
Australia are quick to acknowledge that whilst ebooks can
reproduce the text and images of paper books they cannot provide
the look, feel, smell and general aura of paper books.
Nevertheless, a browse of some of the ebooks listed below will,
we hope, provide the reader with some idea of the paper books
from which the ebooks were produced. We hope to add to the list
over time.</p>

indulgence.</p>

<p><b>Hist!</b> by C J Dennis. From <a href="#dennis">A Book for
Kids.</a></p>
<p>Hist! . . . . . . Hark!<br>
The night is very dark,<br>
And we've to go a mile or so<br>
Across the Possum Park.</p>
<p>Step . . . . . . light,<br>
Keeping to the right;<br>
If we delay, and lose our way,<br>
We'll be out half the night.<br>
The clouds are low and gloomy. Oh!<br>
It's just begun to mist!<br>
We haven't any overcoats<br>
And--Hist! . . . . . . Hist!</p>
<p>(Mo . . . . . . poke!)<br>
Who was that that spoke?<br>
This is not a fitting spot<br>
To make a silly joke.</p>
<p>Dear . . . . . . me!<br>
A mopoke in a tree!<br>
It jarred me so, I didn't know<br>
Whatever it could be.<br>
But come along; creep along;<br>
Soon we shall be missed.<br>
They'll get a scare and wonder where<br>
We--Hush! . . . . . . Hist!</p>
<p>Ssh! . . . . . . Soft!<br>
I've told you oft and oft<br>
We should not stray so far away<br>
Without a moon aloft.</p>
<p>Oo! . . . . . . Scat!<br>
Goodness! What was that?<br>
Upon my word, it's quite absurd,<br>
It's only just a cat.<br>
But come along; haste along;<br>
Soon we'll have to rush,<br>
Or we'll be late and find the gate<br>
Is--Hist! . . . . . . Hush!</p>
<p>(Kok!. . . . . . Korrock!)<br>
Oh! I've had a shock!<br>
I hope and trust it's only just<br>
A frog behind a rock.</p>
<p>Shoo! . . . . . . Shoo!<br>
We've had enough of you;<br>
Scaring folk just for a joke<br>
Is not the thing to do.<br>
But come along, slip along--<br>
Isn't it a lark<br>
Just to roam so far from home<br>
On--Hist! . . . . . . Hark!</p>
<p>Look! . . . . . . See!<br>
Shining through the tree,<br>
The window-light is glowing bright<br>
To welcome you and me.</p>
<p>Shout! . . . . . . Shout!<br>
There's someone round about,<br>
And through the door I see some more<br>
And supper all laid out.<br>
Now, run! Run! Run!<br>
Oh, we've had such splendid fun--<br>
Through the park in the dark,<br>
As brave as anyone.</p>
<p>Laughed, we did, and chaffed, we did,<br>
And whistled all the way,<br>
And we're home again! Home again!<br>
Hip . . . . . . Hooray!<br></p>
