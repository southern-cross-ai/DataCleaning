<p>In 1642, Anthony Van Diemen, Governor-General of the Dutch East
Indies, commissioned Abel Tasman, a sea captain employed by the
Dutch East India Company, to undertake a voyage to the unknown
south seas.</p>

<p>Leaving Batavia in August, 1642, Tasman first set a course
towards Mauritius, then sailing southward, and later easterly, he
reached in November, 1642, the west coast of Tasmania, which he
named Van Diemen's Land. The names of his ships&mdash;Heemskerck
and Zeehaen&mdash;survive in the names of two mountains, the first
land he sighted.</p>

<p>Two years later, on another voyage, Tasman sailed along the
northern coast of Australia (which became known as &quot;New
Holland&quot;) from Cape York to North West Cape.</p>

<p><b>From <i>The Athenaeum</i>, April 7, 1894 (In <i>The Discovery
of Australia, 1902,</i> by Albert F Calvert, p. 146):</b>
</p>

<p>&quot;It appears that the first printed abridgment of Tasman's
MS. Journal of his first voyage was that of D. R. Van Nierop
(1669-74). The second was by T. Valantyn in his <i>Oud en Nieuw
Oost Indien</i> (1724), copied probably from the MS. preserved
among the arichives at he Hague. The third was by Captain J. Burney
in his <a href="/plusfifty-a-m.html#burney">A Chronological History
of the South Sea</a> (1803-17), Vol. III., chap.iv. This was
compiled from the original MS. purchased by Sir Joseph Banks.
Burney, for reasons of his own, assumed this copy to be the
original, against the advice of Mr.G. C. Woide, a learned
clergyman, afterwards an assistant librarian in the British Museum,
who translated it into English.</p>

<p>&quot;It does not appear to be generally known that the text of
this voyage was first printed <i>in extenso</i> by J Swart in the
<i>Verhandelungen en Berigten Amsterdam</i>, 1854-1860, from the
manuscript signed by Tasman, formerly in the possession of the
nautical establishment of Huist van Keulen, of the same
city.&quot;</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">

<p><b>From the <i>Journal of the Royal Australian Historical
Society</i>, Vol. XVIII, Part III. pp. 155-6. (1932):</b>
</p>

<p><i>A Manuscript Journal of Tasman's Voyage, 1642-3</i>
</p>

<p>The mention of Tasman's voyage in the article entitled &quot;The
Navigators of the Pacific from Magellan to Cook,&quot; by Captain
F. J. Bayldon, and published in this number, makes the opportunity
suitable for directing attention to a rare and valuable manuscript
in the Mitchell Library.<br>
Our knowledge of Tasman's famous voyage of 1642-3 depends
principally on two manuscripts, neither of which was written by
Tasman himself. The one in the Archives Department at The Hague,
Holland, is signed by Tasman; and the other important manuscript, a
contemporary account probably written for Salomon Sweers, who was a
member of the Council of India, is the manuscript in the Mitchell
Library, Sydney. For many years it was in the possession of the
Huydecoper van Maarsseveen en Nigtevecht family, from whom it was
purchased in 1926 by the Trustees of the Library.</p>

<p>On comparing the two manuscripts, differences are noticed that
suggest that both may be contemporary copies of a Tasman holograph
journal that has long since disappeared. Professor Heeres edited a
folio volume containing a facsimile reproduction of the manuscript
journal of Tasman's voyage that is in the Dutch Archives, together
with a translation into English and the editor's notes also
translated into English; and the Mitchell Library has also obtained
a manuscript translation into English of the Huydecoper Journal, so
that both journals are available to the student of historical
geography both in the original Dutch and in English
translations.</p>

<p>The Huydecoper Journal contains the earliest map of New Zealand
that is known, probably the first map ever made of that region. It
is an original, and was made by Franchoijs Jacobs-Visscher, the
&quot;steersman&quot; of the <i>Heemskersk</i> (<i>sic</i>), in
1643. It shows that Cook's Strait was entered, but not passed
through, and that the land line was not continuous, but a break
existed, as we now well know, between the middle and the north
islands of the group. As Tasman failed to sail through the strait,
he missed making the discovery that New Zealand was a group of
islands&mdash;a discovery that was made by Captain Cook in
1769.</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">

<p><b>From <i>The History of Australasia</i>, 1879, by David Blair,
pp. 19-20</b>
</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that the only account of this memorable
voyage&mdash;in the course of which the great islands of Tasmania
and New Zealand were discovered&mdash;that the world possessed for
more than a century after its termination was a curtailed
abridgment published at Amsterdam in 1674, and an abstract of a
more extended kind included in Valentyn's great Dutch work on the
East Indian possessions of the Company at Amsterdam. About 1771,
however, a manuscript journal of Tasman's, written by his own hand,
was brought to England by an unknown hand, and offered for sale to
Sir Joseph Banks. Perceiving the value of this precious document,
Sir Joseph purchased it, and deposited it amongst the treasures of
his magnificent library. He also caused an English translation of
it to be made by the Rev. Charles Godfrey Woide, chaplain to the
Dutch chapel at St James's Palace. At Sir Joseph Banks's death, his
library was bequeathed to the British Museum in London, where, no
doubt, Tasman's journal is still to be found. The original document
and the translation were lent by Sir Joseph to Flinders, and also
to Captain (afterwards Admiral) Burney, who was engaged in
compiling a chronological history of the discoveries in the South
Sea (<a href="/plusfifty-a-m.html#burney">A Chronological History
of the South Sea</a>). The work was published in five volumes
quarto in London, between the years 1803 and 1817, and copies of it
are to be found in both the Public and Parliamentary Libraries at
London. It contains the entire text of Tasman's manuscript, with
the exception of some purely nautical details, of no permanent
importance. As the Dutch Government was always very jealous of the
possession of the records drawn up by its voyagers and discoverers,
lest other nations should obtain the benefit of them, it is not
easy to account for the means by which this invaluable document
found its way from Batavia to England. Doubts have been, therefore,
cast, upon its genuineness; but in a carefully-written introduction
Captain Burney discusses at some length the question of the
authenticity of the journal, and proves the point conclusively. In
fact, it possesses every mark of originality. In particular, the
minutest incidents of the navigation, from leaving Batavia to the
arrival at the scene of new discovery, are noted down; details
which have absolutely nothing in them to attract curiosity, or to
repay the trouble of copying at length. No forger would think of
inventing them. Comparing the journal with Valentyn's account, it
is found that the latter copies from it almost verbally, but
condenses a good deal, and alters the narrative to the third
person.</p>
