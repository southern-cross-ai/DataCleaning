<p>Geoffrey Dutton, in &quot;The Australian Collection--Australia's
Greatest Books&quot;, remarks that &quot;The definition of
&quot;classic&quot; should be relevant to both time and place.
There are many books in each country's literature that are
cherished as classics in their homeland but little known
elsewhere.&quot; Hence the inclusion of &quot;Ralph Rashleigh&quot;
in Dutton's list of Australia's Greatest Books.</p>

<p>The book is a &quot;classic&quot; for a number of reasons: its
literary merit; its depiction of the life of a convict; the
circumstances of its composition; and the occasion of the discovery
of the manuscript and subsequent publication.</p>

<p>The novel relates the story of a well-educated Londoner who
drifts into petty crimes, for one of which he is tried, imprisoned,
and sentenced to death. He escapes from prison, only to be
recaptured. However his sentence is commuted and he is transported
to New South Wales. During his life in the colony he is flogged,
placed in solitary confinement and forced to endure both heat and
cold without the benefit of shoes.</p>

<p>Still, this is not a story of hopelessness and the convicts
manage to get up a theatre and Rashleigh is later assigned as a
labourer to a settler. The adventures continue unabated, to such an
extent that Dutton remarks, &quot;Interest in the breathless series
of adventures that make up &quot;Ralph Rashleigh&quot; might flag
if most of them were not so clearly authentic.&quot; As it was, the
author of this work was himself a convict. Colin Roderick, academic
and writer on Australian literature, noted in a foreword to the
1952 edition of the book, that &quot;'Ralph Rashleigh' is the
&quot;only novel of abiding stature to have been written by a man
who during all his Australian life was never anything but a
convict.&quot;</p>

<p>Like Rashleigh, Tucker himself was sentenced to be transported
to New South Wales for the term of his natural life, for the crime
of sending a letter threatening to (falsely) accuse his cousin,
James Stanyford Tucker, with indecently assaulting him, James
Rosenberg Tucker (our author). Tucker spent much of his time in the
colony as a messenger and clerk. On several occasions he was
granted a ticket of leave only to have it revoked each time, save
the last. He died in Liverpool (N.S.W.) asylum in 1866.</p>

<p>In fact, we are not <i>absolutely</i> certain that James Tucker
is the author of &quot;Ralph Rashleigh&quot;, as the following
story will admit. In 1920, at an exhibition of rare books and
manuscripts held by the Royal Australian Historical Society, an
elderly man &quot;turned up&quot; with a manuscript titled
&quot;Ralph Rashleigh or The Life of an Exile&quot;, by Giacomo di
Rosenberg&quot; and handed it to the president of the Society, Mr
C. H. Bertie. The elderly man, Robert Baxter, could only say that
some 50 years earlier it had been left to his wife by her father,
who had it of the author 30 years before that. Three other
manuscripts were also presented at the same time. The date written
by the author, on the verso of the first page of &quot;Ralph
Rashleigh&quot;, was 31st December, 1845.</p>

<p>The paper on which the manuscript was written was watermarked
1840. Other paper in the bundle was ascertained to have come from
the register of assignment of convicts at Port Macquarie (N.S.W.),
the latest dates on those sheets being 1838. These facts, together
with other evidence, suggested that the manuscripts were genuine
work from the 1840s. On the assumption that &quot;Ralph
Rashleigh&quot; was a disguised book of memoirs, in 1929 a
re-written version of the manuscript was published in London. The
reasons for the re-writing were outlined in the publishers' note at
the<br>
beginning of the publication: &quot;We recognized its value and
interest, but the archaic literary style of the writer made us
doubt whether the book would be acceptable to modern readers. So
the manuscript was rewritten, but with absolute fidelity to the
original story.&quot;</p>

<p>The identity of the author of &quot;Ralph Rashleigh&quot;
remained a mystery. Then, in 1949, Mr Bertie &quot;put me in
possession&quot;, as Colin Roderick put it in the foreword to the
1952 edition of &quot;Ralph Rashleigh&quot;, &quot;of all he knew
about the manuscript. Intrigued by its obvious authenticity and
moved by the obscure fate of its author, I was persuaded not to let
the pursuit of that worthy (sic) stop until I had established his
identity.&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for copyright reasons, we cannot include in the
ebook of &quot;Ralph Rashleigh&quot; the complete foreword, by
Colin Roderick, to the 1952 edition. However, Roderick goes on to
detail how he was able to ascertain that James Tucker was almost
certainly the author. After two years,<br>
building upon the knowledge that the paper upon which the
manuscript was written came from the penal settlement at Port
Macquarie, Roderick recounts:</p>

<p>&quot;On the evening of 26 July 1951 I was looking through the
1846 inward correspondence of William Nairn Gray to the Colonial
Secretary. A file of letters dealt with several complaints against
Gray, one of which was that he had misappropriated convict labour
to build a race-course and to enlarge his own garden for profit. To
refute the charges he enclosed a plan of the trifling alterations
to his garden, and another of the mighty public works he had
performed.</p>

<p>&quot;These plans really gave the solution to the problem. Not
only were they in the same calligraphy as the title pages of the
Rashleigh manuscripts, but they were signed with the amateur
architect's name, James Tucker. Several pages attached to them were
in the same handwriting as the manuscript of 'Ralph
Rashleigh.'&quot;</p>

<p>Roderick provides other evidence to corroborate his contention
that Tucker was the author of &quot;Ralph Rashleigh&quot;. For
example Tucker, in a postscript to his threatening letter to his
cousin, mentioned earlier, directed the cousin to &quot;address to
me Mr Rosenberg, the Bell, Exeter Street, Strand.&quot; Further,
Tucker's criminal charge was directed to &quot;James Rosenberg
Tucker&quot;, and at Port Jackson, Tucker's name was entered as
&quot;James Tucker, or Rosenberg.&quot; Rosenberg was, as mentioned
earlier, the name entered on the &quot;Ralph Rashleigh&quot;
manuscript.Some commentators, however, have argued that Tucker
merely copied the manuscript. In an exchange in the
&quot;Bulletin&quot; December 1952 to February 1953, M. H. Ellis
argued that Tucker was a copyist whose known writing, for example a
letter written in 1826, does not reveal the qualities required of
the author of &quot;Ralph Rashleigh&quot;. Roderick, though, seems
to have the weight of evidence.</p>

<p>In the foreword to the 1952 edition of &quot;Ralph
Rashleigh&quot;, Colin Roderick goes on further to note the
&quot;unfortunate introduction [to the 1929 edition] by the late
Earl of Birkenhead. Like the editor of that text, Birkenhead was
misled into believing the book was a memoir entirely and the text
was mangled and falsified to fit this preconceived theory.&quot;
Birkenhead set forth a diatribe in favour of maintaining the death
penalty, using as evidence to support his claim, the
&quot;memoir&quot; of Rashleigh, a person who &quot;had the
advantage of a decent upbringing, but, out of weakness of
character, adopted what seemed the easier life of crime at an early
age.&quot; It was fortunate for Birkenhead that, by 1952 when the
verbatim edition of what turned out to be a novel was published, he
was &quot;late&quot; as it may have saved him from acute
embarrassment.</p>

<p>At Project Gutenberg Australia will be found both the
&quot;first authentic popular edition&quot; created from the
original manuscript, first published in 1952, together with the
heavily edited 1929 edition (including the publishers' note and
introduction by Birkenhead). The 1929 edition is now, of course,
just a curiosity.</p>

<p>I trust that you will agree that this is a &quot;classic&quot;
story about a classic work of Australian literature--&quot;Ralph
Rashleigh, The Life of an Exile&quot; by James Tucker.</p>
