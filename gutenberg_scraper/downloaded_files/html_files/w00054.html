<p>SLEEP has been aptly called &ldquo;nature's grand restorative,&rdquo;
and is at once a temporary refuge from distress, and one of the best
preparations for its endurance.&mdash;From the toils of the mind and of
the body, it is alike a relief, and embraces, without distinction, the
prince and the beggar.</p>

<p>In the enjoyment of this comfort did the various tenants of Mr.
Holland's mansion fit themselves for their respective duties on the day
following, and get rid of the effects of their different grievances on
the preceding. The lawyers, according to their wont, indulged themselves
in late morning sleep, with its accompanying visions of pleasure, until
the announcement of breakfast. But the earliest crowing of the cock
roused to their labors the busy family, and Gideon was prompt in
following their example. Taking leave of his kind entertainers, he
repaired to Waynesville, and found Eoneguski impatiently waiting his
arrival. The latter had been a good deal alarmed when first missing his
young friend, and, through the hands of Mercury, gathered together his
moveables, which Gideon's own disordered mind had forgotten, and to which
the attention of Mr. Holland had not been drawn. These the Indian
carefully preserved, to be replaced in the possession of their owner as
soon as they should meet again. Upon diligent inquiry, he learned whither
Gideon had gone, and all uneasiness was at an end when he traced him to
the keeping of Moses Holland.</p>

<p>Many of the Cherokees who were at Waynesville they day before had
already preceded them towards the Indian country, and others were
preparing to march in the same direction. Gideon was gratified to find
his property, about which he began to feel some uneasiness, in the hands
of his swarthy friend; but the buoyancy of spirits with which he had set
out upon his expedition was greatly diminished by the reduced weight of
his purse, and the recollection of the contemptible figure he must have
cut at Waynesville under the influence of spirits. Nor did it escape his
observation that Eoneguski was less cheerful than he had been previous to
their arrival, although he was entirely ignorant of the cause.</p>

<p>Nothing remarkable occurred on their journey, which now lay along an
Indian trail in a southwesterly direction, frequently crossing and
re-crossing Richland Creek, and failing this noisy attendant, they soon
found themselves pursuing, in the same way, the course of another stream
called Scott's Creek. Here the scenery became more wild&mdash;the Balsam
towered above them in dark majesty, generally throwing its shade upon the
stream, which, now and then escaping into bright sunshine, sparkled, as
in delight, to fell the genial warmth. But whether in sunshine or in
shade, Scott's Creek gushed along its rocky bed, furiously lashing those
huge hard impediments against which it incessantly smote, and ever
throwing up its spray as it recoiled from these rough encounters. With
renewed courage it glided past them, foaming and bubbling&mdash;here
making melody with a regular tinkling flash, and there hissing
continually, as in hot displeasure. But they chose not to follow Scott's
Creek through all the sinuosities by which it found its way to the
Tuckasege, but leaving it to quarrel and fret alone the remainder of its
rough journey, they struck across to that river by a nearer route.</p>

<p>Having passed the Tuckasege, they did not rely upon the guidance of
Savanna Creek from its very mouth, but cutting across another angle of
four or five miles, they encountered this stream some distance above, and
avoided an hour of unnecessary travelling. Having here fallen in with it,
however, they left it no more until it conducted them up the steep side
of the Cowee Mountain, the most easy and practicable route. On reaching
the summit of this mountain, a large section of what was then, and still
is, called the Tennessee Valley, was spread out before them. But Gideon
could not avoid an expression of astonishment at the apparent incongruity
of the name and the thing. To be sure, he found himself upon the summit
of a mountain, the side of which, when he looked down it westwardly,
seemed nearly perpendicular; and, in the distant haze of the horizon,
over against him, mountains still more lofty lifted up their heads, in
silvery brightness, borrowed from the snow with which they were crowned.
But in the intermediate space called the Valley, mountain beyond mountain
rose in thick array, apparently leaving not a spot of level ground for
the eye to rest upon. As they descended Gideon could not fail to remark a
considerable increase of temperature, and, upon closer observation, not
only a greater advance, by two or three weeks, of vegetation, but
numerous plants were discovered entirely unknown on the opposite side of
the mountain. A great change in the nature of the soil was also
perceptible; the light dark mould prevalent on the eastern side being
exchanged on the western for a compact hard clay, of a hue somewhat
resembling brick dust, with occasional veins of sand running through
it.</p>

<p>As they descended towards the valley the air became still more mild,
and Gideon remembered the promise of Eoneguski, that &ldquo;here he would
find the game more plenty, and that the sun would shine more
brightly.&rdquo; Part of it he found realized, and his doubts were
removed as to the remainder.</p>

<p>Continuing to descend, their way became less precipitous until they
reached the Tennessee River, on the near side of which an Indian hut or
two was scattered among fields almost level, presenting the appearance of
long use, and having suffered seriously from improvident culture. Similar
fields occupied the acclivity of the opposite bank, with a very narrow
slip of irregular low ground running along the margin of the stream. On
the farther side of these fields, about one-fourth of a mile from the
river, rose the village of Eonee. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said the Indian,
pointing to it, with a rather melancholy smile, &ldquo;is the home of
Eoneguski.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While they were preparing to cross the Tennessee, a mound of earth,
about one hundred yards from its margin, in the direction they were
going, attracted the attention of Gideon. It was evidently not the work
of nature, but had been accumulated with great exertion of human toil.
Whether the earth of which it was composed had been gathered from the
ground immediately around it, or brought from a distance, could not be
determined with any certainty. It was situated on the most extensive
level which, in that vicinity, the low grounds of the Tennessee afforded.
On one side of it flowed that river, and on the other a small swampy
creek, which, so far as we have ever learned, is not honored with a name.
The mound was, at the base, about four hundred feet in circumference, and
that side of it which fronted the angle formed by the junction of the
river and creek, in a northerly direction, rose to the height of twenty
or twenty-five feet in a cone, forming an angle with the surface of the
earth of about seventy or seventy-five degrees. This was probably the
case with the whole circumference; but on the opposite side from the one
which fronted the junction of the creek and river, a projection sloped
off in a southerly direction about fifty feet in width, forming a gradual
and easy ascent from the level ground to the summit, where was a smooth
area about sixty-six feet in circumference, surrounded by an embankment
about two feet high.&mdash;Upon it, and around it, were scattered here
and there small fragments of what had evidently once been earthen vessels
of great antiquity; but how they had come there, or to what purposes been
applied, were matters for conjecture.</p>

<p>Gideon had frequently heard of what were called by those who spake,
&ldquo;Indian mounts,&rdquo; as well as various suppositions as to how
they were erected, and for what objects designed, but he had never seen
hem; and as their course now lay directly past one, Eoneguski could not
refuse so far to gratify his curiosity as to allow him a few moments to
examine it. All that he had heard about these mounds now flashed upon his
mind. One theory was, that, in compliance with a superstition among them,
the Indians within a certain district of country brought, each, a
spadefull of earth from the land he cultivated to an appointed place, by
which Heaven was propitiated, and fertility imparted to the soil, and the
seasons rendered fruitful; and that the earth thus collected, was thrown
up into a regular shaped <i>&ldquo;mount.&rdquo;</i> This theory seemed
to derive countenance from the fact, that the mound now before him, so
far as he could discover, was entirely composed of rich soil, and that no
portion of dead unfruitful matter entered into its formation. Besides,
there was but little appearance of the earth immediately around it having
been deprived of any of its original elevation.</p>

<p>Another theory was, that those &ldquo;mounts&rdquo; were places of
sepulture for the dead. But the only circumstance which seemed to have
any bearing upon this question was, that there were scattered around the
one under observation, very small fragments of what were once apparently
the bones of some animal, but whether they ever formed a portion of that
wonderful fabric &ldquo;man,&rdquo; he was compelled to leave to Cuvier,
or some other person better skilled than himself to decide.</p>

<p>He had heard, also, that these mounds were erected as trophies of
victory by the successful party, on the scenes of great battles
distinguished in the bloody traditionary annals of the warlike
aborigines. But to the truth or falsehood of this supposition he could
find no clue.</p>

<p>Again, it had been said they were designed as places of strength when
the country was assailed by an invading foe. If any thing gave the
slightest color to this supposition, it was that those spike-formed
stones, supposed to have been used by the Indians to head their arrows,
before they became acquainted with iron and fire-arms, and commonly
called &ldquo;Indian arrows,&rdquo; were found there in considerable
abundance; and that the position acquired strength from being flanked and
fronted by the river and the creek, the remaining side communicating
exclusively with the defenders, who, successively ascending in parties,
as their predecessors became weary, or expended their ammunition, might,
from the commanding elevation of the mount, more effectually annoy the
enemy, while their own force was placed by it in comparative safety. But
these circumstances were more than counterbalanced by its being evident
to the eye most unpractised in military affairs, that means of defence
much more simple, less costly, and incomparably better fitted for the
purpose, could not have escaped the attention of the rudest warrior.
Besides, the very small number of men which it was capable of receiving,
and the certainty that an enemy, the least gifted with craft, by making a
small circuit, might come upon their rear, or take some other route,
rendered such expensive labor of little utility.</p>

<p>The last supposition, and probably the most plausible he called to his
recollection, was, that they were erected for religious purposes. In
connection with this idea, he had heard the fragments of earthen vessels
spoken of as being the remains of those used on sacrificial occasions. He
also observed, what had at first escaped his notice, another mound, not
more than one-tenth the size of the larger, a few feet to the eastward of
it, with a plain oval summit; but this furnished no additional light to
the subject of his speculations.</p>

<p>Hastily leaving this novelty, out of deference to an impatience which
he concluded Eoneguski would feel to embrace his father after so long an
absence, Gideon, not without some sense of delicacy lest he might be
prying into matters which, from the uncertainty attending them, he
reasonably inferred were the subjects of profound secrecy among the
Indians, inquired of Eoneguski the origin and design of those mounts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those mounts,&rdquo; said the Indian, &ldquo;have filled the
soul of Eoneguski with wonder no less than that of his white
brother.&mdash;The Oewoehee have not always peopled these hills and
valleys.&mdash;Many moons ago,&rdquo; he continued, catching up a handful
of sand and shaking it, as he extended his hand toward Gideon, to signify
more than he could count, &ldquo;before the white people came across the
great waters, the fathers of my people hunted their game on the hills
which lie far away yonder, (pointing towards the northeast,)&mdash;but
the Great Spirit was angry with his children, and sent the angel of death
to destroy them;&mdash;they fell thicker and faster than the vanquished
in battle&mdash;but they saw not the warrior by whose arm they were
smitten. Terror seized them&mdash;and they fled from the graves of their
fathers&mdash;from the unburied bodies of their kindred&mdash;whose flesh
was festering in the open air, and their bones bleaching in the sun and
wind;&mdash;for they had learnt that to touch them even for burial was
death. They fled from the breath of the destroyer, and, like the
wandering Iroquois, they travelled in search of another home, where the
wing of the angel of death might not overtake them. Long, long they
wandered, and passing by numerous tribes of their red brethren, who did
not offer them the pipe of peace, and crossing streams wide and deep, to
which the Tennessee is but as the papoose to the full grown
warrior&mdash;they came to this land, resolved to perish or make it their
place of rest. But the land was not empty&mdash;no, the Great Spirit hath
left no part of his beautiful creation where the eye of man is not to
enjoy it, and his heart to throb with gratitude to his Creator. But they
came, as I have heard come the waves of the mighty ocean, which roll on
and on, each forcing another from its place;&mdash;and thus did my
fathers chase from their abodes the ancient inhabitants of this land, to
yield it in their turn to the pale faces.&rdquo; He paused &mdash;</p>

<p>He resumed&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, Gideon, come it will, when the Oewoehee
must be swept from their homes by the children of thy people.&mdash;It
may be when Gideon and Eoneguski have passed away to the land of the
blessed;&mdash;but come it will.&rdquo; This was uttered with an emotion
which somewhat disconcerted Gideon, but he made no answer.</p>

<p>Eoneguski paused again, and then with more firmness continued,
&ldquo;The people whom my fathers found in this valley were taller and
more comely than either your people or mine&mdash;they were fairer than
we, but darker than you&mdash;they knew much, very much more than our
people, but were far less wise than yours. They called themselves the
children of the Sun, and worshipped fire as the Great Spirit. Our fathers
have told us that they erected these mounts, but for what purpose they
knew not. But they have passed away&mdash;far away&mdash;to the country
where, it is said, they behold their god when he sinks to rest in the
evening on the bosom of the great waters. They are gone.&mdash;The god
whom they worshipped yet shines upon the land&mdash;but his children are
not here to rejoice in his beams.&mdash;Not an echo is heard from the
mountains which once rung with their voices.&mdash;You look in vain for
one print of their footstep beside the mounts they erected.&mdash;They
stand alone&mdash;and tell, in a voice which the ear hears not&mdash;that
here they have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the tradition thus communicated by Eoneguski, and from many
vestiges of a higher degree of civilization than that known to the
Indians, being discovered in various parts of the country now
constituting the United States of America, it seems probable that the
same race of people which were found in Mexico and South America,
originally made their way from some part of the old world to the northern
portion of the continent of North America. In the regular spread of
population, or attracted by a more genial clime, they were driven, like
the precedent wave by its successor, by arrivals from the overcharged
fountains of the trans-marine world, and gradually progressed
southwardly. This idea is greatly confirmed by the heliotrophic habits,
common to the Mexicans, with the people mentioned by Eoneguski. If this
much be true, it is not unlikely that these mounds were erected for
depositories of the sacred fire, whose light, from that elevated
position, might at night be seen from a great distance, to cheer the
hearts of the Ghebers. The water at hand, and the smaller mound were, it
is probable, not without their use on sacrificial occasions. The wide and
easy ascent on the one side was, probably, for the priests, while the
uninitiated were gathered around the other sides of this huge altar.
Perhaps even human victims were there offered up, and furnished the bones
which have led so many to what we must think an erroneous conclusion,
that these mounds were places of sepulture.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_4">CHAPTER II.</a></h3>

<p><br>
                          The chief his old bewilder'd head withdrew,<br>
                          And clasped him by the arm, and looked him
through and through.</p>

<p align="right">CAMPBELL.</p>

<p>FILIAL duty is dignified in the divine law with the first place among
the relative obligations of mankind, and the voice of nature echoes the
celestial proclamation. Even among the inferior animals, love towards the
authors of their being exists to some extent, and in the human family its
greater or less development is one of the most distinctive marks by which
the advance of an individual or class in moral excellence may be known.
The total absence of it characterizes the monster only, while its highest
exhibitions touch the hearts of the beholders with the most delightful
sense of moral beauty. It differs from parental love in being more of a
sentiment and less of an instinct, although both these may partake, in
some degree, of either quality. It is the first affection the heart can
know, and is probably the root from whence the others spring, and in
proportion to its strength so is apt to be that of all succeeding it. An
affectionate son seldom fails to fulfil with propriety the subsequent
relations of life.</p>

<p>It was with no small share of this benevolent sentiment that Eoneguski
approached the hut of his father, filled at the same time with anxiety
respecting his condition. The subject of the mound had beguiled the way
between it and the wigwam of Eonah, where Gideon and Eoneguski found
themselves ere they were aware. The aged chief did not advance to meet
his son and his scarcely less welcome companion, but, bound by disease to
his couch, could only in a recumbent posture express his satisfaction at
beholding them. He caused Gideon to stand up before him and place himself
in every light and position, while he carefully studied his form,
countenance, and manner. At length, shaking his head mournfully,
&ldquo;The eyes of Eonah are dim,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and they look in
vain for the form and features of his pale brother.&mdash;But why should
I wonder?&rdquo; he added, with a bitter smile, &ldquo;is any thing now
as it was in the days that have long passed by?&mdash;and if Aymor
himself now stood before me&mdash;how unlike would he be to that Aymor,
who, more than three hundred moons ago, was a captive to the bow of
Eonah? Is not Eonah himself changed?&mdash;Where is the fleetness of his
foot?&mdash;where the strength of his arm?&mdash;Never more will he join
in the dance, either for peace or war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eoneguski perceived with sorrow that the apprehensions conveyed to his
mind by Mercury were the shadows of a sad reality, and that although
Eonah might possibly linger for a season, he was lying on that couch from
whence he was never more to rise in his own strength.</p>

<p>With the delicate politeness which one would scarcely have looked for
in a savage, he had another wigwam arranged for Gideon, that he might not
be disturbed by the infirmities of the aged chief. It was not long in
being prepared, and Eoneguski, having seen Gideon comfortably fixed,
according to his own ideas of comfort, returned to the wigwam of
Eonah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The spirit of Eoneguski is sad,&rdquo; he said, addressing the
old chief, &ldquo;to see the hand of the Great Spirit laid in anger on
his father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the Great Spirit angry with all whom he afflicts!&rdquo;
inquired Eonah, in a faint voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do the red men ever torture their friends?&rdquo; said
Eoneguski. &ldquo;Is it not their enemies only, whom they have taken in
battle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are all his creatures, then, the enemies of the Great
Spirit?&rdquo; said the old chief; &ldquo;for who is there that breathes,
and is a stranger to affliction?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Spirit himself only knows,&rdquo; replied the son;
&ldquo;yet, surely, he never afflicts his children, but when they
displease him. Has the Saga visited my father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Eonah; &ldquo;the chief of Eonee has seen
too many moons, to believe that Susquanannacunahata is wiser than
others&mdash;or that he is a favorite of the Great Spirit.
Susquanannacunahata is a bad man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let not my father say so,&rdquo; replied Eoneguski; &ldquo;our
people reverence the words of Susquanannacunahata. He is a Great
Medicine, and will renew strength in the limbs of the chief of Eonee. He
is a great Prophet, and will turn away from him the wrath of the Great
Spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When strength was in the bones of Eonah,&rdquo; said the chief,
&ldquo;he listened to the words of Susquanannacunahata, and pretended to
believe them; but he laughed at them in his heart, for he knew that
Susquanannacunahata was a villain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why,&rdquo; said Eoneguski, with a sarcastic bitterness he
could not repress, &ldquo;should my father listen to words he did not
believe, and pretend to respect him whom he knew to be a
villain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eoneguski,&rdquo; said the old chief, &ldquo;listen to your
father. A few days more and I must follow my ancestors to that country
where there is no more age nor sickness;&mdash;whose streams are clearer
than the drops of dew;&mdash;whose fruits are more luscious than the
melon or peach;&mdash;whose valleys rejoice at the same moment, in the
sweet roasting-ear and the fully ripe corn;&mdash;and over whose hills
the uncounted game is forever bounding. Then must Eoneguski become the
chief of the Eonee;&mdash;and he must shew himself valiant in fight, and
wise in council.&mdash;Such has been thy father, Eonah.&mdash;He knew the
people of Eonee believed that the Great Spirit sometimes spoke to one of
his children, and made him a Prophet and a Great Medicine. He knew that
the voice of the Prophet and Medicine was louder in the ears of the
people than that of their chief.&mdash;What was Eonah to do?&mdash;Must
he tell the people that the Saga was an impostor, and a villian; and
cause himself to be hated and despised among them?&mdash;A wiser counsel
directed the course of thy father; and by the hands of the Saga he turned
about the hearts of his people, according to his pleasure; and answers
which they foolishly thought were sent from Heaven, were dictated by
their chief. Susquanannacunahata has been to me a spy upon Chuheluh; and
through him have I been able to defeat the schemes of that wily Fox. In
the meantime Chuheluh has believed that the Saga was plotting with him
for the accomplishment of his purposes; and has been looking forward to
the moment when success should repay him for his many defeats.&mdash;But
every plan he has formed has been communicated to me by the Saga, and by
his assistance it has been counteracted.&mdash;Yet, think not it is
because the Saga loves Eonah that he hath preferred his service to that
of Chuheluh. No&mdash;it is because he knows that I know him; and he
fears me.&mdash;But Chuheluh, wise as he is, hath superstition, like the
rest of the Oewoehee; and although Susquanannacunahata hath presumed so
far upon his credulity as to let him see too much, so that he at length
begins to doubt the inspiration of the Saga, yet he hath not altogether
burst those cords of superstition his mother twined around his heart, in
his father's wigwam.&mdash;But time hath made Susquanannacunahata
acquainted with the properties of many herbs, and he may alleviate pangs
beyond his art to cure. I have, therefore, thought of sending for
him&mdash;yet it is chiefly for thy sake, my son, that I wish him to
come&mdash;he holds the keys of the hearts of the people of Eonee, and he
must open them to Eoneguski: and the power which the father has exercised
over the Saga, we must transfer to the son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused&mdash;then suddenly starting, as if some new thought had
flashed upon his mind&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;Why was Eoneguski so long in
overtaking the victim of his vengeance? I know that my son is swift in
the chase; and the game escapes not upon which he fixes the aim of his
rifle. Why was the young warrior so long absent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eoneguski was silent, for he knew that, should he tell the whole
truth, his answer must fall upon the heart of his dying father with a
weight sufficient to crush it: and, to speak at all, and to speak the
truth, were, with Eoneguski, one.</p>

<p>The old chief turned his dim eyes inquisitively on his son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show me,&rdquo; he continued, impatiently, &ldquo;Show me the
scalp of John Welch&mdash;bring it near, for the eyes of Eonah are dim;
and he would look upon the first scalp his son has wrenched from the head
of a pale face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no scalp,&rdquo; said Eoneguski, calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; said the chief: &ldquo;And what will Eoneguski say,
when they shall ask him, 'Where is the blood of the Leech?'&mdash;If he
shall answer, 'Eoneguski is not a woman&mdash;he hath avenged the blood
of the Leech'&mdash;then will they tauntingly ask, 'and where is the
scalp of the murderer?' What will Eoneguski say?&mdash;The red men boast
not their deeds of valor, unless they can show the scalps of their
enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eoneguski was still silent; yet it was not on his own account he
desired to conceal the truth, but feared its effects upon the prejudiced
and proud heart of his father.</p>

<p>Eonah again turned his face towards him:&mdash;&ldquo;Will not
Eoneguski tell me,&rdquo; he resumed &ldquo;why he hath left it in the
power of Chuheluh to bring the body of John Welch, and deny that your
hand is red with his blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another time,&rdquo; said Eoneguski, &ldquo;and the son of
Eonah will tell his father all that hath passed since he left him. When
the Saga shall have come, and restored health to the chief of Eonee, he
will be able to hear it.&mdash;But his strength is not now
sufficient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chief of Eonee will soon be no more,&rdquo; said the old
man, solemnly; &ldquo;and it will cheer him on the bed of death to listen
while his son rehearses his deeds of valor.&mdash;Let the young warrior
begin,&rdquo; he added, impatiently, &ldquo;for the heart of Eonah longs
for the feast of vengeance, when he shall hear how the murderer of the
Leech fell beneath the arm of Eoneguski.&mdash;But he is sad to learn
that the young warrior knows not the use of the
scalping-knife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finding there was no hope of parrying the subject&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John Welch yet lives,&rdquo; said Eoneguski, with that dogged
composure which always accompanies, in a resolute man, the doing an act
whose consequences he knows will be deeply painful to himself, but from
the performance of which there is no escape with honor.</p>

<p>A yell, such as is uttered by a stricken hound, burst from Eonah, and
startled even Gideon in the neighboring wigwam. The old chief writhed in
agony, like a wounded serpent; and Eoneguski even feared that it was the
final struggle between life and death, which had been, according to his
fears, thus prematurely brought on by himself. He hesitated whether or
not to call for assistance, but deemed it would be unavailing. He was
also restrained by a shame and apprehension which ought only to have
accompanied the consciousness of guilt, of which he was entirely
clear.</p>

<p>It may be here remarked, that it not unfrequently happens that persons
are placed in circumstances, where a consciousness that there is ground
of suspicion against them, produces an effect upon their conduct and
manner very similar to that of actual guilt; and what is only their
apprehension of what will be the determination of other minds as things
appear, is mistaken for their own conviction of the fact by those who
behold them. Such was the situation of Eoneguski, who, struck with the
embarrassment he must experience in making any witness of his father's
situation, acquainted with its immediate cause, was in this way held in
indecision until the violent paroxysm, into which the old chief had been
thrown, began to subside, and he saw that it was not mortal. As soon as
he perceived that his father was sufficiently recovered to comprehend
what he should say to him; and aware that any act of officiousness on his
part, would not be well received without the previous approval of the
chief, he thus addressed him&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can Eoneguski do for his afflicted father&mdash;shall he
send for the Saga, to Sugar Town?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he replied, with astonishing power of voice.
&ldquo;Begone, and leave me!&mdash;Eonah will perish like the decaying
oak, which time and the wind have shorn of its branches.&mdash;The last
bough has fallen in dishonor from the aged trunk.&mdash;Eonah has no
son!&mdash;and never again shall his ear be mocked with the cry of
'Father.'&mdash;Begone&mdash;I say begone and leave me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eoneguski knelt beside the couch of his father, and feelings too
powerful for even the stoicism in which he had been brought up to
control, forced the tears in rapid succession down his cheeks, while
sobs, frequent and violent, heaved his bosom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Eonah already dead?&rdquo; said the almost frantic chief,
&ldquo;that no obedience is rendered to his voice. Once more I say,
begone!&rdquo; and with an arm so palsied by disease that an infant's
would have overmatched it in force, he dealt his son a blow as he knelt
beside him&mdash;&ldquo;Coward, I say, begone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unconsciously the hand of Eoneguski was upon his scalping-knife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A blow,&rdquo; he muttered to himself&mdash;&ldquo;A
blow;&rdquo; and the scalping-knife was partially withdrawn from the belt
in which it was suspended;&mdash;&ldquo;But it is he,&rdquo; he said,
rising to his feet, &ldquo;and it is enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked moodily out of the hut, and entered that of Gideon, where
Mercury had already furnished a repast, which awaited only his
arrival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Skiagusta requires Mercury in his wigwam,&rdquo; said he to
that sable attendant, &ldquo;as soon as he has completed his attendance
upon Gideon, and spread for him his couch. Eoneguski is heavy, and
desires not to eat,&rdquo; he added, turning to Gideon; &ldquo;but Gideon
is in the house of his father.&rdquo; He threw himself down in the corner
of the wigwam, but it was not to sleep.</p>

<p>Here, undisturbed by untimely questions, he cast in his mind the
distressing embarrassments by which he was beset, and deliberated on the
part it became him to act. He had been treated with an indignity which an
Indian is not wont to tolerate, even from a father, yet he cherished no
desire of revenge, and although the injured party would gladly have
exchanged pledges of forgiveness. But he knew it was vain, in the present
mental condition of the chief, to hope, by any advances or explanations,
to appease his anger, or sooth his offended pride. He would have
consulted the Saga, in his anxiety to act for the best, but the
confidence he once reposed in his counsels was destroyed&mdash;for Eonah
had denounced him as a villain. In the course of his reflections,
&ldquo;Absence,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;may re-awaken the yearnings of
paternal love, which indignation will continue to stifle while kept alive
by my presence. But whither shall I go?&rdquo; he said, in bitterness of
soul. &ldquo;Where shall the son seek for shelter, against whom his
father hath closed his door in displeasure?&mdash;I will go to
Tesumtoe,&rdquo; he said, at length, &ldquo;the heart of the Little Deer
will be open to Eoneguski.&mdash;Her smiles will come upon him like the
warm sun upon one perishing with cold. He will tell her the story of his
griefs, and she will bid sorrow fly away, and say that the smiles of the
Great Spirit are on the actions of Eoneguski.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These last reflections had so happy and soothing an effect upon the
troubled spirits of the Indian, that he fell into a quiet slumber,
visited by dreams of peace and happiness.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Gideon, rather disappointed in the manner of his
reception at Eonee, having, during Eoneguski's absence, gathered, from
the communication of Mercury, much useful information respecting Indian
habits, and the advantageous nature of the alliance which Eoneguski was
about to form with the Little Deer; with many other matters which, with
the gossipping disposition of a negro, Mercury thought proper to intrust
him with, was well prepared, by appetite, to profit by the intimation his
host gave him to proceed with his supper. Having despatched it, nothing
was left for him but to throw himself upon his couch, and ruminate upon
all he had seen and heard. He was annoyed by the apparent depression of
Eoneguski's spirits, at which he was not, however, much surprised,
naturally enough ascribing it to the severe illness of his father. Sleep
soon put an end to Gideon's speculations upon the affairs of real life,
and sent him to chase in dreams the shadows of fancy.</p>

<p>The next morning Eoneguski inquired of Mercury into the condition of
his father, and, learning that he was peevish and irritable, determined
to put in execution the plan conceived by him on the preceding night. As
soon, therefore, as they had finished their morning meal,
&ldquo;Gideon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;has seen that the chief of Eonee is
not in a condition to treat the son of his friend as becomes him; in a
few days he will be better, and will desire to see Gideon, and talk with
him. You will not wonder that it is the purpose of Eoneguski to visit the
Little Deer at Tesumtoe. Gideon will go with him, for the Little Deer
will be glad when she sees the friend of Eoneguski.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having charged Mercury to be diligent in his attention to the old
chief during his absence, Eoneguski set out with his white companion for
Tesumtoe. On their way they passed by Sugar Town, and Eoneguski's
solicitude for his father prompted him to call upon the Saga and request
that he would visit him, charging him, at the same time, (lest he might,
on that account, reject his medical assistance,) not to let Eonah know
that he owed to himself the visit of the Saga.</p>

<p>They found the Saga neither in dishabille, as did Chuheluh, nor yet in
all the imposing apparel of savage conjuration, in which he wrought so
powerfully upon the mind of John Welch. Although Wissa admitted them with
some caution, yet he did not, as usual, close the door upon the first
visiter, but seemed quite delighted to see Eoneguski, and, (could he have
as well understood them,) as solicitous to obey his behests, as those of
his master. But before Eoneguski was allowed to communicate his wishes to
the Saga, Gideon was forced to retire. The latter was a good deal
impressed with the appearance of the Saga, and lost no time, after
Eoneguski rejoined him, in inquiring into his name and character, of
which he had not before heard any thing. The Indian had no difficulty in
communicating what was publicly known of the Saga, (being, indeed, the
extent of his own knowledge, except the few slight hints so recently
received from Eonah;) but that was not enough to satisfy the curiosity of
Gideon.&mdash;Speculations on the character and appearance of this
mysterious personage served to amuse him occasionally during the
remainder of their progress towards Tesumtoe, the way to which he
nevertheless found somewhat tedious.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_5">CHAPTER III.</a></h3>

<p><br>
                          Love rules the court, the camp, the grove,<br>
                          And men below, and saints above;<br>
                          For love is Heav'n and Heav'n is love.</p>

<p align="right">SCOTT.</p>

<p>THE empire of this gentle passion, which the poet describes as so
universal, includes even the untaught child of the forest, who doubtless
experiences, in his simple wooings all those pleasing agitations of the
imagination which impart to love half its zest in the most civilized
condition of life. He is as sensible to the chilling influence of a
frown, and the genial effect of a smile, from the chosen of his heart, as
his white brethren. He feels as keenly apprehensions for her safety and
her constancy, and sympathizes as deeply in all that concerns her. He is
as severely tormented with fears that his conduct or motives may be
misunderstood, and pants as ardently for her approbation.</p>

<p>Such at least was the experience of the noble savage, of whom we have
had so much occasion to speak. As he approached Tesumtoe indescribable
emotion caused his heart now to rise buoyantly in his bosom, like a
joyful bark, freighted with objects of delight upon the gentle waves of a
summer sea, and then to sink sadly down with the weight of gloomy
thoughts which poured into his soul, like the same vessel, when, through
some unlucky opening, the treacherous waters flow in and swamp her. Now
would hope whisper to him words of comfort, and then would doubt chill
him with suggestions of fearful import. He had not been unconscious from
the first that the presence of Gideon must embarrass both himself and the
Little Deer, and impart to their interview a coldness by no means
agreeable. But he comforted himself in the conscious fulfilment of duty
for the sacrifice he was making, convinced that it could not have been
pleasant to Gideon to have remained at Eonee under existing
circumstances.</p>

<p>It was evening when they reached Tesumtoe, a village near the head of
one of the forks of the Tennessee River, along which their journey for
the most part lay, as it meandered through a long narrow valley, from
which the hills gradually sloped upon each side, terminating in numerous
peaks or spurs of various heights and dimensions.</p>

<p>Their course from Eonee had been directly south&mdash;the mildness of
the climate had increased in their progress in a ratio truly
astonishing&mdash;and the full moon of a delightful spring evening was
pouring down upon them a flood of light as they entered the village,
where all was quiet. So still and calm did every thing appear, that any
one, whose imagination suitable reading had supplied with the thought,
would have been struck with a feeling similar to that of the great poet,
whose name is prefixed to this chapter, when looking upon the ruins of
Pompeii, he exclaimed, &ldquo;The city of the dead, the city of the
dead.&rdquo; But to Gideon it suggested the recollection of some of those
ambuscades he had heard of Indians laying for an unwary foe, where a
quiet, even deeper than peace herself is wont to know, is broken in the
twinkling of an eye, by noise and uproar the loudest, the wildest, the
most continued and appalling, ever uttered by the grating voice of
war.</p>

<p>Impressed with this thought he moved accordingly, and, as he followed
his guide, was ready at the slightest noise, for flight, or to assume the
attitude of defence, as circumstances might dictate. They had not
proceeded far, however, when, from the wigwams, as they passed, the men
came out to look upon them, while the women and children might be seen
slyly peeping from the doors and loop holes, which answered the purposes
of windows, as well as the smaller crevices of the cabins.</p>

<p>On they moved through this city of automata, where not even a laugh,
whispered remark, or word of salutation, reached their ears as they
proceeded. The noiseless tread of his guide was answered by no echo, but
Gideon distinctly heard his own heavy step reverberated here and there,
unmingled with any sound save the maundering of the Tennessee River, as
it flowed past the foot of the acclivity, and the voices of the Wekolis',
which, in considerable numbers, poured forth their wild plaintive cry
from the lofty tree tops interspersed through the village.</p>

<p>They approached, at length, a building of far better appearance than
any Gideon had seen since he entered the Indian country, which indeed,
exceeded, both in looks and comfort, those of the ordinary white
settlers. It was not situated on the street, like the other huts in the
village, but had, in front of it, a neat yard, paled in with pieces of
riven timber, about the height, breadth, and thickness of ordinary
paling. But they were perfectly rough, and no nails entered into the
construction of this fence, the paling being secured in their places, by
crossing and interlacing, with three rails, which ran along horizontally,
one above another, about two feet apart, each end being inserted in the
side of a post.&mdash;These posts being set in the ground, at intervals
of eight or ten feet successively, and having rails inserted in their
sides, as before mentioned, into which, in their turns, the palings were
wrought, formed a continued fence, considered in rude life both neat and
substantial.</p>

<p>As Eoneguski opened the gate of this enclosure, a large shaggy wolf
dog rose from his lair, and shaking himself so that his ears flapped
against the sides of his head, began to bay fiercely.
&ldquo;True-nose,&rdquo; said Eoneguski, &ldquo;poor fellow;&rdquo; the
dog ceased barking, and wagging his tail, and showing his long white
teeth, as much as to say, &ldquo;see what I could have done to an
enemy,&rdquo; came up to the Indian and laid his nose in his hand, but,
seeing Gideon, withdrew it again, and began to growl surlily. &ldquo;Be
quiet, True-nose,&rdquo; said Eoneguski, and the growling ceased; but the
dog stood still, wagging his tail, and looking steadfastly upon the
stranger, as if studying his physiognomy, and saying, at the same time,
&ldquo;pray, who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you love me, love my dog,&rdquo; is a homely adage, in
which, with great simplicity, expression is given to what all have felt.
But Eoneguski was in his own mind, on the present occasion, inclined to
carry it somewhat further, and infer from the affection of the quadruped
the unchanged attachment of the family to which he belonged. True-nose,
however, on his part, got the full benefit of the adage, for the Indian
thrust his hand into his knapsack, and drawing out the remnants of his
travelling provisions, threw them down to the huge black animal, and
patted him affectionately.</p>

<p>By this time a black servant girl had opened the door of the dwelling,
and stood examining the strangers by the clear moon-light.
&ldquo;True-nose knows one of them,&rdquo; she exclaimed, in the Indian
tongue, and quickly herself recognized in the darker of the two strangers
an old acquaintance.</p>

<p>A considerable stir was now heard in the interior of the dwelling,
such as those who have come unexpected visiters to a house in more
polished society, where young ladies happen to dwell, are no strangers.
Meantime the visiters entered, and were shown into an apartment of
considerable comfort, and somewhat elegantly furnished. In the hearth
burnt a fire evidently intended rather for light than warmth. A solitary
individual sat within the apartment, whom Eoneguski approached as one
from whom he expected a kind reception. It was a female, dressed in a
style of neatness approaching to elegance, far surpassing any thing that
Gideon had ever before witnessed. More than sixty winters seemed to have
sprinkled their snows upon hair originally jet black, but now rivalling
in whiteness the cap, well suited to her age, from beneath which a lock
here and there strayed down, like skeins of silver thread, over a brow
whose complexion, together with that of the other exposed parts of her
person, proclaimed in a silent, but convincing language, that she was a
Cherokee half-breed. But age had not bent her frame, nor extinguished the
fire of a bright black eye, which turned not on Eoneguski as he
approached, but rested wildly on Gideon, with a troubled yet inquisitive
glance. She spoke not&mdash;and as her countenance, on which the vestiges
of beauty lingered, changed distinctly but rapidly, seen as it was in the
evening of life, it might remind one of an interesting ruin upon which
the moon-beam now rests brightly, and now is thrown into partial and then
into complete shadow, by the cloudy rack passing over the disk of that
planet, urged onward by the wind. The unpleasant suspicion flashed upon
the mind of Gideon, that Insanity was hanging out the ensigns of her
tyranny over the ruined empire of Reason. This impression gathered
strength when he observed that the female frequently carried her hands
across her forehead, bosom, and other parts of her person, forming
thereby imaginary lines in a horizontal direction, which she immediately
crossed at right angles by others made perpendicularly. At length her
eyes became immoveably fixed upon Gideon, with pupils widely dilated,
while she herself assumed a position not unlike that of a cat about to
spring upon its prey. Nothing was left to Gideon and Eoneguski but to
gaze upon her in mute astonishment. Whilst doing so, Gideon perceived a
large strain of beads suspended upon her neck of different sizes, these
of equal ones occurring at regular intervals. The beads were formed of
some red substance with which Gideon was unacquainted, and to them was
appended a black cross, of the material of which he was also ignorant,
although he had no difficulty in determining that the ring by which it
was suspended, as well as the four tips of the cross, were of pure gold.
Gideon became convinced by her manner that she had taken him for a person
she knew; an impression attributed by him to some vagary of a disordered
intellect. In a short time, however, she appeared herself convinced that
she was in error. Her eye glided off from Gideon with an air of
disappointment, and she gradually assumed a more natural look and manner.
Eoneguski seemed to think that now was his time for addressing her, and
made another effort to approach. But so far from meeting his advances,
she turned away her head, and stretched forth her hands, as if to signify
&ldquo;Stand off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Indian was confounded. &ldquo;I must be bewitched;&rdquo; he
exclaimed internally; &ldquo;some evil eye has fallen on Eoneguski that
he should be strange to every one; his actions are misconstrued, and his
friends look coldly upon him.&mdash;But where is the Little Deer?&rdquo;
he continued, still holding communion with his own thoughts, &ldquo;Will
she too turn away her head from her young warrior?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A light step was now heard in an adjoining apartment. Eoneguski glided
out of the room, and soon Gideon perceived, at no great distance, low
murmuring voices, like the sound of many bees gathering their luscious
stores from a parterre of flowers. As for himself, he was alone with the
incomprehensible being who had not opened her lips in speech since his
arrival, and whose presence had inspired him with no very agreeable
feelings, and little was left to him but to contemplate her more
particularly. Her countenance had gradually become more composed; the
wild fire of her eye had abated, and, as Gideon looked and looked again,
he discovered attractions where there had been nothing before but painful
repulsion. The traces of beauty became more conspicuous, and many
virtuous feelings shone dimly through the haze of melancholy that had now
settled down and shaded her countenance.</p>

<p>At length, in a sweet musical voice, the tones of which thrilled
through his heart, she broke in upon the silence. &ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;you are welcome to the wigwam of Yenacona.&mdash;It is
long&mdash;very long since Yenacona has looked upon a complexion such as
thine&mdash; but pale faces are glancing, and fair locks are waving in
the visions of past days which crowd upon her soul.&mdash;White hands
rocked the cradle of her infancy, and fair tresses were twined around her
infant fingers, as she drew nurture from a mother's bosom.&mdash;Those
lessons which breathed from a mother's lips, and coming fresh and warm
upon the heart of childhood, find there a home as eternal as memory
itself, are associated in the mind of Yenacona, with a being of thy race
as gentle as the dove&mdash;beautiful as the firmament&mdash;and pure as
the light;&mdash;a being such as our fancy paints the angels.&mdash;But
there is a love, whose warmth, compared to that for a mother, is as the
scorching plain of Summer to the mild sunny valley of the
Spring&mdash;and with such a love glowed the young heart of Yenacona
towards one whose manly brow was pale as thine, and around which
clustered the brown locks of Europe. But it is past:&mdash;Wonder not,
then, stranger, if the sight of thee should stir in its very depths the
heart of Yenacona;&mdash;if it should recall to her presence the departed
and the dead, and thicken the shadows of grief that daily rest upon her
soul.&mdash;But I have said you are welcome&mdash;language cannot speak
how welcome&mdash;for what to the mourner affords such delight as
stirring anew the ashes of her grief?&mdash;But,&rdquo; she added, in a
low, guttural voice, pointing towards the adjoining apartment, from
whence the murmuring sounds still proceeded, while a fearful change came
over her countenance, &ldquo;he is not welcome. He has made the widow
childless&mdash;he has created for her new sorrows, and not merely
stirred the old.&mdash;If a Christian might hate and curse one who has
wronged her, on my knees would I beseech the Virgin and the Saints, and
even the everlasting Father himself, for curses on the head of yon bloody
savage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unconsciously suiting the action to the word, she had risen from her
chair, and with eyes uplifted to Heaven, had clasped together her dark
meagre hands, and bent one of her knees as in the act of throwing herself
into the posture of supplication. But suddenly recovering herself, and
raising her crucifix to her lips, &ldquo;Dear Saviour,&rdquo; she
continued, &ldquo;who, in thy human agony, didst in the garden of
Gethsemane sweat drops of blood&mdash;pardon the frailty of a poor child
of earth, and impute not to her as guilt the involuntary outpourings of
human passion:&mdash;and for <i>him</i>&mdash;enable me to
say&mdash;'Father forgive the poor misguided savage&mdash;for he knew not
what he did.' &ldquo;</p>

<p>Just at this moment Eoneguski returned to the apartment, and Yenacona
meeting him, said, with a faint smile, &ldquo;Eoneguski forgive the
rudeness of your first reception; but you will not wonder when you know
that new sorrows have visited the heart of Yenacona, already crushed with
its ancient burden&mdash;and yet I will not deceive you&mdash;Eoneguski
is not forbid the wigwam of Yenacona&mdash;but he cannot be welcomed
there as in times that are past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is enough,&rdquo; said the Indian, &ldquo;there is
One,&rdquo; pointing solemnly upward, &ldquo;who knows the heart of
Eoneguski, and He will one day speak, and say that it is right towards
Yenacona. But a dark cloud now rests upon the path of Eoneguski, and his
friends cannot see him as he is. But the Great Spirit will send his sun
to chase away the cloud, and their faces will again look kindly upon him.
Yenacona has said that he is not driven from her dwelling;&mdash;but the
heart of Eoneguski is proud&mdash;and would swell too large for the home
of Yenacona&mdash;but the Little Deer is here&mdash;and the heart of
Eoneguski grows small when he thinks of the Little Deer&mdash;and he will
not turn his back upon Yenacona.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A light irresolute step was again heard approaching the door, and,
pale as an Indian girl could be, the Little Deer entered. Her eyes were
red with weeping, and an unwiped tear rested unconsciously on her cheek.
Suffice it to say, she was the <i>beau ideal</i> of Indian beauty, and,
although in evident sorrow, her step was as elastic as the animal whose
name she bore. Her dress, allowing for their difference of age, was a
good deal in the style of that of Yenacona, that is, upon the European
model, in which neatness was carried by taste to the very verge of
elegance. She had about her no Catholic ornaments, such as were worn by
Yenacona, but a gold chain was suspended upon her neck and bosom; large
earrings hung down, almost resting upon her shoulders; and a pair of wide
rich armlets ornamented her wrists, as if to call away the attention from
the round polished, well turned, arms immediately above them.</p>

<p>Cupid, a little heated with the scene in the adjoining apartment, was
bathing himself in the tear-drop on the cheek of the Little Deer just as
she entered, and, startled at the sight of Gideon, at whom he was
provoked for thus taking him by surprise, he hastily caught one of the
arrows from the quiver he had committed to the keeping of the Little
Deer, and let drive at the luckless youth with his whole
force.&mdash;Gideon had only time to perceive his danger, as he felt the
keen polished shaft mercilessly cleaving its rapid way among his
heart-strings to the very centre of life, and electrifying his whole
system with a fire which ran tingling and tittillating through every
fibre. It blazed out at his cheeks in glowing flame, and he panted for
relief from its scorching heat. But his fate was sealed&mdash;the
Promethean fire had seized upon his vitals, and there was no escape from
its consuming power.</p>

<p>Meantime the Little Deer continued to advance, and seated herself by
the side of Yenacona. There was some little embarrassment among all the
parties.&mdash;Eoneguski, like a true Indian, had thought nothing of the
ceremonial of introductions, but the other three at once perceived that
in each other, which seemed to say, &ldquo;amongst us there must be
something beyond the rough intercourse of savages.&rdquo; Yenacona was
the first to manifest the presence of mind required on the occasion.
&ldquo;You have not favored us with the name of our new guest,
Eoneguski,&rdquo; she said, addressing him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is the son of a friend of the chief of Eonee,&rdquo; replied
the Indian, a little disconcerted at perceiving that he had neglected
what would have been proper on the occasion, &ldquo;and is called Gideon
Aymor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The color forsook the cheeks of Yenacona, and she was apparently ready
to sink down with some powerful emotion; but resisting her feelings,
whatever they might have been, with much effort, &ldquo;Mr. Aymor,&rdquo;
she said, in her peculiarly sweet voice, and with a melancholy smile,
&ldquo;I have already told you that you are welcome to my dwelling, and
informed you of my name. This maiden is my niece, who, after the custom
of her people, is called&mdash;the Little Deer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gideon endeavored to act well his part in his very novel situation,
and strove for his best bow. Never before had he felt more desirous to
please, and never before had he been so fully convinced that he was a
bumpkin. But Love has some generosity in his tyranny, and while he plays
his subjects many distressing pranks, not unfrequently supplies them with
an inspiration more rich and genuine than that borrowed from Castalia,
and better qualifying them to show to advantage. The imagination of
Gideon was very highly excited by the circumstances under which he was
placed, and he seemed to himself in a region of enchantment. His opinion
that Yenacona was insane and disagreeable, had given way to an impression
that she was highly gifted, both in mind and body, and a being, in all
respects, invested with most attractive interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he, in reply to her introduction of the
Little Deer, &ldquo;when I left the land of the whites, I foolishly
believed I was leaving all that could please the eye, or interest the
feelings, and deemed not that I was coming to bask in the light of
beauty,&rdquo;&mdash;(bowing to the Little Deer,) &ldquo;or to drink
wisdom from a deeper fountain,&rdquo; (making a similar obeisance to
Yenacona,) &ldquo;than it ever was my lot to encounter in my own
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He would have said more, but conscience told him that he was plotting
treason against his friend Eoneguski, and, like other traitors, he was
apprehensive of detection.</p>

<p>A repast, more sumptuous than any of which Gideon had ever before
partaken, was spread for the guests, and even wines of the &ldquo;sunny
France&rdquo; were not wanting to cheer their hearts. The guests did not
stint their cheer, and even Eoneguski's multiplied vexations became like
dark specks in the distant horizon, while a landscape of exquisite
beauty, over which moved every object that could delight his soul, lay
immediately before him. With hearts swimming in ecstasy, they both
retired to repose, and Gideon dreamed of chasing the Little Deer through
the valleys of desire, and over the hills of doubt, and across the plains
of hope, with eager haste, but tedious duration.</p>

<p>The next morning came, and Eoneguski, compelled by a sense of duty,
set out on his return to Eonee, to see how matters stood with his dying
father; but there was no necessity for the return of Gideon, and
Eoneguski did not regret when he heard Gideon accept the invitation of
Yenacona to remain some days longer with her. He thought that, under
existing circumstances, a friend at court might not be inconvenient, and
especially as the illness of Eonah might render Gideon's situation
unpleasant at Eonee, and would probably prevent his own speedy return to
Tesumtoe.</p>

<p align="right">BYRON.</p>

<p>A THIEF, from some place of concealment, beholds an unconscious miser
burying, in a secret corner of the earth, his cherished treasure, which a
life of toil and successful industry have been spent in accumulating.
Having made the deposite, the unsuspecting wretch turns to depart, and
the heart of the thief leaps with joy and anxiety to seize the precious
hoard, as he beholds the last wave of the garments of the departing
owner.</p>

<p>Such were the feelings of Gideon, when he caught the last glimpse of
Eoneguski's receding form, and he was left alone with the Little Deer. On
downy pinions the hours flew past him, while opportunities numberless
presented themselves of seeing and conversing with her, and even the
broad wings of time brushed him not in his transit. While thus situated,
there was, with him, no computation of hours, and the game, which had
been one of his inducements for coming to the Indian country, was
entirely forgotten. He seldom saw the melancholy of Yenacona interrupted
by a smile, but frequently, when he happened to be alone with her, she
seemed about to speak, and then, as if checking herself, would suddenly
resume her book or needle, with both of which she was quite familiar. Nor
had her niece failed so to share the benefit of her aunt's skill in these
important matters, as to become likewise considerably proficient.</p>

<p>Gideon had been some time at Tesumtoe, when one day in a stroll around
the village, he was led in his wandering towards the banks of the
Tennessee. Spring had now fairly opened, and the bushes on the margin of
the stream had all put forth their emerald gems, and the larger trees
were fast following their example. Casting his eye along the river, he
was not a little surprised at observing about equi-distant from each
other, as far as the eye could reach, slender smoke-wreaths curling up
towards heaven, and forming at last a continuous cloud, hanging lazily
over the middle of the stream, like a canopy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can this mean,&rdquo; thought he, and drew near for the
purpose of satisfying his curiosity. But it was still more excited when
he perceived that the columns of smoke were sent up by as many small
fires, over each of which some vessel, used for culinary purposes, was
simmering or blubbering away, according to their respective fortune. But
if it was still more excited by these things, it was in no degree
lessened, when opposite to each of these little cauldrons a promiscuous
group of men and women was splashing and sporting about in the river like
so many &ldquo;geese at play.&rdquo; Presently they came out to the
miniature cauldrons, and with sticks dipped up from them some boiling
herbs, with which, after suffering them to cool for a moment, they rubbed
rapidly their feet and legs, and, running to the river again, plunged in.
This process being repeated several times, they put on their garments,
and having extinguished their fires, bore off the vessels they had been
using to their respective cabins.</p>

<p>Gideon in vain inquired of one or two Indians the meaning of what he
had witnessed. All he could get out of them, was, that it was an ancient
custom, but what it meant, or whether it was practised for health or
religion, they could not, or would not inform him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Eoneguski were here,&rdquo; thought he to himself, &ldquo;he
would explain it to me.&rdquo; But Eoneguski was not there, and his next
thought was, &ldquo;Perhaps I can learn it from the Little
Deer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He returned to the dwelling of Yenacona, and would probably have
thought no more about the matter, but while at dinner it accidentally
occurred to him, and he mentioned what he had seen, and inquired into the
meaning of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is one of the superstitious rites of the poor deluded
Cherokees,&rdquo; said Yenacona, crossing herself, &ldquo;and I doubt
whether they themselves know what it means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do all the Cherokees practise it?&rdquo; said Gideon, casting
at the same time an expressive glance across the table at the Little
Deer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All, I believe,&rdquo; replied Yenacona, &ldquo;who have not
forsaken the idolatry of their people, and become followers of the
Cross;&mdash;all I mean who have not become Christians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the Little Deer a Christian?&rdquo; inquired Gideon,
abruptly.</p>

<p>Yenacona looked at her niece&mdash;their eyes met&mdash;and the clear
red skin of the Little Deer was suffused with a blush, which occupied her
whole face, neck and bosom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust I am a Christian,&rdquo; said she, timidly and
faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she is not now a Christian, I hope soon to see her
so,&rdquo; said Yenacona. &ldquo;But she has not yet discarded the
superstitions of her fathers, and, among others, observes the Spring bath
of cold water and bitter herbs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And was the Little Deer,&rdquo; inquired Gideon, with some
warmth, &ldquo;among the damsels who this day bared themselves in the
broad light of Heaven, and shamelessly flounced about in the Tennessee
River?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Little Deer blushed again, and there was an expression of anger as
well as of shame in her countenance, but she answered softly, &ldquo;It
is the custom of my people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gideon was silent. His faith to Eoneguski was stealing in to occupy
the place of love to the Little Deer, which the effusion of cold
Tennessee water had partially expelled. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said he
internally, &ldquo;marry a woman over whose person the wanton air has
liberty to breathe once a year; aye, and unscreened too from the most
licentious eye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>How much further he may have pursued his reflections is uncertain, but
he was here interrupted by the fascinating tones of Yenacona's voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the Little Deer considers herself
the betrothed bride of an Indian chief, and he would not consent that his
wife should throw off the customs of his people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Little Deer will never be a bride,&rdquo; replied a low
tremulous voice, almost choked with emotion.</p>

<p>A speedy change came over the feelings of Gideon. The simplicity of
innocence, that master charm in woman, was so evident in all that was
said or done by the Little Deer, and was so striking in the tone and
matter of her last remark, that she was restored to his imagination in
all her original purity, and had his knowledge of scripture supplied him
with it, he would have been struck with the force of the expression as
applicable to her, &ldquo;To the pure, all things are pure;&rdquo; and he
felt that she was no more contaminated by her late exposure, than the
infant in whose existence days only could be numbered. Her plaintive
voice made an undesigned appeal to his heart, which was irresistible, and
she was reinstated in its full possession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But can it be,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;that her purpose of
marrying Eoneguski is already unsettled? What can be the cause? Is it
possible that my good fortune is such, that a kind feeling for me has
already shaken the firm hold my Indian friend once held upon her
affections?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He determined to probe the matter deeper. &ldquo;It will make at least
one heart miserable should the Little Deer keep that
determination,&rdquo; said he, with an affection of gaiety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not doubt it,&rdquo; said the Little Deer sighing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is the will of Heaven that my words should come to
pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust there is some mistake in that,&rdquo; said Gideon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is kind in you to wish it so,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but
you will wish in vain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That must depend upon yourself,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;for neither our wishes nor
our actions are always under our control.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the Little Deer does not marry,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it
must be because she does not wish it, for she may choose for herself a
mate among the best and the proudest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Little Deer blushed again, but not so deeply as before;&mdash;it
was just perceptible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that what you have told me is
not true, and yet I am not offended with you. Is it not strange, that a
known attempt to deceive us should afford us pleasure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How have I attempted to deceive you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you not say, I might choose for myself a mate among the
best and the proudest?&mdash;In one sense, I feel that it is true, but
not as you meant I should understand you. But as I said before, I am not
angry, and am even grateful for your attempted deception.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The white men,&rdquo; said Yenacona, with a smile approaching
more nearly one of pleasure than Gideon had ever before seen playing upon
her lips, &ldquo;are skilled in the art of flattery, as it is called, and
the Little Deer has confessed the truth:&mdash;It is music to a woman's
ear.&mdash;Our mother Eve heard it in Eden, and what nothing else could
have done&mdash;it won <i>her</i> to sin, and forfeit Paradise.&mdash;Let
the Little Deer take heed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gideon Aymor is not skilled in the art of flattery,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;and speaks only to the Little Deer what he believes in his
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Mr. Aymor, although you here see Yenacona in a wilderness,
she is no stranger to the deference paid to woman by all classes of the
white men, and hence the women of the red race always lend to them a more
willing ear than to the men of their own tribes. By the one they are
addressed in language approaching idolatry&mdash;by the other with
professions of proud superiority.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Heaven,&rdquo; thought Gideon to himself, &ldquo;she is
teaching me how to woo her niece, and supplant Eoneguski.&rdquo;
&ldquo;None of my race,&rdquo; he said in reply, &ldquo;has ever been
more subdued by the charms of woman, than is Gideon Aymor by those of the
Little Deer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the Little Deer, &ldquo;if I were foolish
enough to believe you in earnest, I should have reason to be angry. Mr.
Aymor came here as the friend of Eoneguski to visit&rdquo;&mdash;she
hesitated, and became embarrassed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing which Gideon Aymor would not do rather than
incur the displeasure of the Little Deer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Little Deer is not easily offended with her friends, when
no offence is intended,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>Dinner being ended, the maiden arose from the table, and retired to
her own apartment, leaving Gideon alone with Yenacona.</p>

<p>There was a thoughtful silence of some minutes.&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Aymor will pardon me,&rdquo; at length said the latter,
&ldquo;for asking how I am to understand what has just passed in my
presence? Is it his purpose seriously to assail the heart of the Little
Deer? or are his expressions to be understood as the unmeaning gallantry
of a passing hour? Mr. Aymor will remember that the Little Deer is my
niece&mdash;nay, (let me utter the afflictive truth,)&mdash;the only
being who owns one drop of kindred blood, or can claim any peculiar
interest in the heart of Yenacona. Excuse me for saying you are beneath
the shelter of my roof, a welcome participant of its poor hospitality. I
have said, I am no stranger to the effect upon the heart of a simple
Indian girl, when her ears drink in the strange but delicious music of
delicate flattery, which the men of your race know so well how to pour
forth as a lovely song. If then you would not desire to win the heart of
the Little Deer, cease to drop upon her ear the poison of flattery; for
why should the guest of Yenacona make her niece unhappy?&mdash;Tell me
then in truth, does the white man wish to win the heart of the poor
Indian maiden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gideon was not a little surprised at being so abruptly interrogated
upon a subject which, even in the rude simplicity of the society in which
he had been brought up, it would have been thought indelicate in the
relation of a young woman to be the first to break to one who might be
her suitor. Yet he could not but acquiesce in the propriety of Yenacona's
question, under the circumstances, dictated as it appeared to be, by a
proper regard for the honor and happiness of her niece&mdash;but the
answer was to him a matter somewhat perplexing.&mdash;It was true, he
felt for the Little Deer something of passion, and was fully aware of her
advantageous prospects, to say nothing of her immediate
possessions&mdash;but he was not altogether prepared to take an Indian
squaw as his wife&mdash;nor had he made up his mind to the villany of
winning her heart to abuse the possession;&mdash;neither had he so far
overcome the claims of gratitude and friendship to Eoneguski, as to
betray his confidence and avow himself his rival;&mdash;and as he had not
time for much deliberation, each consideration contributed to the
formation of the very hasty answer he gave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Little Deer is lovely,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and Gideon
Aymor cannot look upon her without feeling the power of her beauty. But
is she not the betrothed of Eoneguski? and is not her heart already too
much his to be won by another?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; replied Yenacona, &ldquo;that she hath
promised herself in marriage to Eoneguski; but she was then a heathen
like himself; since that time the glorious light of the gospel hath sent
a few scattered rays across the dark soul of the Little Deer, as the
luminary of Heaven pours here and there a slender stream of light into
the thick darkness of a dungeon through some occasional chink, found only
by his searching power. And is there any fellowship between light and
darkness? and can one who hath caught but the faintest glimpse of 'that
light which cometh down from above,' voluntarily shut her eyes upon it
forever, and again plunge into the unmitigated gloom of heathen
superstition? Mr. Aymor, my own sad experience supplies me with a
melancholy warning against an alliance between a Christian and a Heathen.
The Little Deer hath been already instructed that there is no obligation
to keep faith with heretics, and that it would be a damning sin to do so
in a compact to be consummated with sacramental solemnity. But there is a
still greater difficulty.&mdash;The Little Deer can never be the wife of
Eoneguski, and she knows it. What does Mr. Aymor say? Does he desire to
possess the heart of the Little Deer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might I do so if I would?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told you,&rdquo; replied Yenacona, &ldquo;of the power
of a weapon which I have seen you use so dexterously&mdash;farther than
this I can say nothing of your prospects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But would the voice of Yenacona be employed for or against my
suit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what I desire to know,&rdquo; said Yenacona,
&ldquo;from Mr. Aymor, himself, and therefore it is that I wish you to
answer my questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will confess that I desire to win the heart of the
Little Deer,&rdquo; said Gideon, having gradually advanced to
self-committal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swear to me then,&rdquo; she said, solemnly, assuming a
countenance of dignified severity&mdash;&ldquo;Swear to me upon this
sacred symbol of the sufferings of our crucified Lord, that when you have
won the heart of the Little Deer you will wear it near your own, as I
have done for years past this holy crucifix,&rdquo; she said, applying to
her lips that which she wore appended to the rosary around her neck,
&ldquo;until death shall dismiss one of you to Paradise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She extended towards him the cross, but Gideon, instead of complying
with her demand, drew back with irresolution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you hestitate?&rdquo;&mdash;said she; and, after a pause,
added, &ldquo;It is the only condition upon which Yenacona can consent to
your becoming a suitor to her niece. Nay, more, after what has passed, it
is the only condition upon which you can longer remain a tenant of the
wigwam of Yenacona.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gideon was perplexed, and, after some moments reflection, &ldquo;I am
ready to comply,&rdquo; he said, and reached out his hand towards the
crucifix.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo;&mdash;cried Yenacona, in a tone of voice which
sent a chill through his blood, and caused his fell of hair to rise like
quills upon the fretful porcupine&mdash;&ldquo;here is no priest as
Heaven's vicegerent to receive the vow&mdash;here is no sacred cathedral,
with its dark, heavy arches, to whisper back their solemn
utterance&mdash;but hark!&mdash;dost thou not hear?&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>So deeply interested had Gideon been in the conversation, both at
dinner and afterwards, that those indications so perceptible to all who
know any thing of the country of which we are writing, that mark the near
approach of a spring or summer thunder storm, had entirely escaped his
attention. But when Yenacona directed his ear towards it, he distinctly
heard a loud rushing sound, (to borrow a simile from the scriptures,)
&ldquo;like the voice of many waters.&rdquo; He saw that the trees upon
the mountain top over against them were powerfully agitated, and veiled
their heavy summits before some great power passing over them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord bowed the Heavens, and came down,&rdquo;&mdash;she
said, in a loud, solemn tone of voice, pointing upwards with her right
hand, while she stood in tragic dignity, with a countenance in which the
deepest religious awe was mingled with sacerdotal
severity,&mdash;&ldquo;the earth shook and trembled, the foundations of
the hills also moved and were shaken.&mdash;He rode upon a cherub, and
did fly;&mdash;yea, He did fly upon the wings of the wind.&mdash;His
pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the
sky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused&mdash; A dark shadow was seen careering onwards from the
direction of the mountain, and a deep and sudden gloom settled over the
village. But nothing yet was heard save the uninterrupted roaring,
hissing sound which first caught the attention of Gideon. Suddenly a
broad glare of light burst through the gloom that surrounded
them&mdash;it dazzled, for an instant, the vision of Gideon, and in
another he beheld its reflection playing over the ornaments on the person
of Yenacona, like the bright fiery tongue of a serpent. Her silver locks
glistened, and seemed almost inflamed from its reflected lustre. Another
instant, and a crash, such as might have attended the bursting of the
whole fabric of nature, was heard immediately above them. Gideon felt as
if he were himself smitten by some powerful arm, and cowered almost to
the floor. Yenacona stood erect, though much excited, like the priestess
of some ancient oracle, when under the maddening influence, mistaken by
the deluded worshippers for the inspiration of her god.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord also thundered in the Heavens,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;and the Highest gave forth his voice.&rdquo;&mdash;Then suddenly
changing her flexible voice, and subduing it to a deep guttural whisper,
&ldquo;In the immediate presence of thy Eternal Judge;&rdquo;&mdash;she
continued, &ldquo;with the voice of His might now sounding in thy ears,
bow down upon thy knees and swear.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>Gideon found himself a passive instrument in the hands of the
mysterious being in whose presence he stood; to whom his imagination, for
the present, attributed a more intimate connection with the tremendous
war of the elements then going on, than either truth or reason could
justify; and almost unconsciously did as he was commanded.&mdash;He threw
himself upon his knees and kissed the crucifix, as each one of the
thousand mountains filling the valley of the Tennessee, caught the long
sound above them, and sent it rolling onwards until it fell faintly on
the listening ear, as it died away in the distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is well!&rdquo;&mdash;shouted Yenacona, &ldquo;and a gleam
of joy may yet come to the heart of the wretched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gideon arose pale and agitated, as the heavy cloud began to pour
itself out upon the earth, more like the gushing and dashing of a million
of small cataracts, than the gentle rain descending from Heaven. Peal
upon peal of thunder rent the air&mdash;now booming with the dull and
heavy sound of a distant cannon&mdash;then with the clear, shrill crack
of a rifle, and anon sounding as if the cloud had been a heavy screen of
some strong dark material suddenly rent asunder by a gigantic arm. Gideon
and Yenacona stood silent;&mdash;each wrapped in the thoughts or
apprehensions peculiar to their respective bosoms.</p>

<p>At length the fall of rain gradually moderated, until the numberless
small streams it had formed, as they poured along their muddy little
currents to mingle with the Tennessee, could be distinctly heard above
the diminished clamor of the storm, as the voice of the son grows more
loud and manly as that of the parent is sinking into &ldquo;childish
treble pipes again.&rdquo; The thunder peals were changed to a low,
distant grumbling, like the growl of a retreating lion, uttered in
warning to those who might think of pursuit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Tis past,&rdquo;&mdash;said Yenacona, &ldquo;the fury of the
storm is over;&mdash;but the vow hath been uttered under circumstances no
less imposing than those under which she exacted it from
<i>him.</i>&ldquo;</p>

<p>The sun now suddenly burst forth, and a joyous smile seemed to suffuse
itself over the face of nature. A golden network was spread over the
earth, like a gorgeous mantle, as, in the process of prismatic
refraction, the yellow, orange, and red rays which shot down into the
sparkling rain drops, along with the violet, indigo, blue, and green,
shone out more conspicuously in their separation from their less
pretending companions. Far in the east the sky began at first, near the
horizon, at two points distant from each other, to assume a variegated
luminous appearance, which gradually projected, in the segment of a
circle, towards the zenith, meeting and forming a most resplendent
rainbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a rainbow round about the throne,&rdquo; said
Yenacona, with a countenance reflective of the calm cheerful beauty of
the scene without, 'in sight like unto an emerald.'&mdash;It is the arch
of peace and glory&mdash;it is the bow of promise.&mdash;Mr.
Aymor,&rdquo; she continued, turning to Gideon, &ldquo;Heaven hath heard
your vow, and will smile upon is fulfilment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Gideon, somewhat recovered from his
perplexity and agitation, &ldquo;I may count, madam, on your kind
offices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but most depends on
yourself;&mdash;become a Christian, not only in theory but in practice,
and do your utmost to render the Little Deer so, and your success is
certain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most wicked white man I ever saw,&rdquo; said Gideon,
&ldquo;would like to have his wife a Christian; and the value of the
Little Deer, great as it now is, would be doubled in my eyes, were she to
become so entirely a Christian as to throw off all the absurd and
disgusting practises of the Cherokees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our help is from the Lord,&rdquo; said Yenacona, kissing her
crucifix, &ldquo;and our lady and St. Tamany will doubtless accept my
petitions for your success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She curtsied, and retired from the apartment, with the dignity of a
queen, leaving Gideon to recover, at leisure, his self-possession.</p>

<p align="right">BYRON.</p>

<p>THERE is a native innocence and simplicity common in the female heart,
but rarely found among the ruder sex. The former is characterized,
besides, by a more rigid adherence to principle, when once adopted, in
spite of the sacrifices to which it may lead. Women are, perhaps, more
easily deceived than men, in questions of propriety, and lend a more
submissive ear to any one who assumes to be a teacher; but when sound
lessons are once taught, the fruits of sound practice follow with most
infallible certainty. Let them once be fully satisfied that an action
involves a violation of principle, and it is seldom that considerations
of mere expediency can tempt them to its commission. The decisions of the
moral sense are probably not more correct in them than with men, but they
are more inflexible. In some atmospheres paintings are said to preserve
their freshness of coloring much better and longer than in others; and
there seems to be, in the female bosom, a peculiar aptitude to retain in
their pristine beauty each delineation of moral excellence. The
simplicity of the female character melts us into love, its virtuous
firmness excites our admiration, and commands our esteem.</p>

<p>The storm described in our last chapter as being so opportune in the
scene between Gideon and Yenacona, was an awful visitation to one of the
inmates of the same dwelling. That morning the soft south breeze had
early chased away the fog which, in the course of the night, had risen,
like rags of silver gauze, from the bosom of the river, in the mellow
moonlight, and uniting, finally, in one mass, had overspread the valley,
wrapping each object in one general robe of invisibility. The rising sun
had called the breeze into being, with his earliest rays, and, like a
dutiful offspring, the breeze, in its turn, flew, upon cheerful wing, to
chase away every thing that might obscure the glories of its parent.</p>

<p>The Little Deer heard the foliage of a perennial vine stirring under
the gentle breath of the zephyr, and rose from her couch. &ldquo;Thou
incomprehensible Being,&rdquo; she exclaimed, opening her casement, and
falling upon her knees, in the attitude of adoration, &ldquo;whom my
fathers have worshipped in their simplicity, as the Great Spirit, and of
whom wonderful things are told by the white men, who adore thee as the
triune God, assist the feeblest of thy creatures in her search after
truths, upon which rest her present and everlasting peace.&mdash;And if
thy red children are lost in ignorance, which covers them as the fog did
recently my native valley, let thy breath come gently, and chase away the
dark shadows, as the soft breeze disperses the vapor, that the light of
truth may cheer and warm their hearts.&mdash;But how shall thy will be
communicated to a being such as I am?&mdash;Approach me not in thy
terrors, for how should I stand before thee?&mdash;But pour into my soul,
as the dew falleth upon the earth, the suggestions of thy
will.&mdash;This day is one of the customs of my people to be observed,
and it is denounced by some, as not only vain and unprofitable, but
dangerous and wicked.&mdash;Pity my blindness, oh, August Being, and
teach me (for I am in a great strait) how it behoveth me to act.&mdash;If
my people are right, I should be base and recreant not to share with them
the reproach of well-doing;&mdash;but if they are wrong, give me some
manifestation that it is so, for I would not go with the multitude to do
evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having said this, she determined to conform to the custom of the
Cherokees, as she had always done, unless something should occur that she
might interpret into a Divine rebuke. But the morning passed on in
calmness, and not the slightest circumstance transpired unusually to
affect her mind; and the arguments of Yenacona, neither few nor slackly
pressed, had proven insufficient to convince her.</p>

<p>The appointed hour arrived, and she repaired, with the other maidens
of Tesumtoe to their parent stream; but not, as had been supposed by
Gideon, did she expose her person among the mingled multitude.&mdash;No,
the lessons of delicacy imparted to her by her aunt, had not been thrown
away, but impressed themselves deeply on her character. Like another
Diana, with a few chosen friends of her own sex, she sought a sequestered
spot, where a cave in a rock, making up to the very brink of the stream,
enabled them to conform to the customs of their people, without violence
to their modesty.</p>

<p>The ceremony was over, and she had returned home, and nothing had yet
occurred to convince the maiden of the impropriety of the act in which
she had been engaged. But at dinner the young white stranger, who had
been kind and attentive to her during his stay at Tesumtoe&mdash;who had
frequently addressed to her words of commendation&mdash;and for whom she
entertained a sisterly affection, had evidently shrunk from her with
something like horror, when he understood that she had participated in
the ceremony he accidentally witnessed. This simple circumstance went
farther than any thing had previously done to shake her confidence in the
rectitude of her course. She retired from the dinner table
self-dissatisfied, and repaired to her own apartment, full of unpleasant
reflections.</p>

<p>Before leaving the table she had observed some symptoms of the storm,
but they made no impression, until she found herself alone, and then the
gloom which the gathering cloud threw over her apartment painfully added
to the distress of her mind. A thought of anguish flashed upon her, with
the first faint glimmer of the distant lightning. &ldquo;This is the
sign,&rdquo;&mdash;she said to herself, &ldquo;and the Terrible One is
displeased with what I have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She heard the hoarse rushing sound, as the cloud swept down from the
mountain. &ldquo;He is coming,&rdquo;&mdash;she murmured,&mdash;&ldquo;He
is coming in anger;&rdquo;&mdash;and threw herself upon her bed, with
palpitating heart and labored respiration.</p>

<p>A blaze of intense light burst into the apartment, licking up, as it
were, in an instant, its whole contents, and departing as suddenly as it
came, left behind an almost impalpable gloom. Another moment, and the
awful crash, apparently just above her head, as if tearing for itself a
way through the very roof of the building, completed the triumph over her
mind of the imposing thought that, in partial compliance with her own
prayer, the Eternal himself was chiding her with His awful voice, or was
coming to make, in her destruction, an example of terror to the residue
of her people. In an agony of fear she hid her face in the bed-clothing,
and remained, almost breathless, while the storm was expending its
fury.</p>

<p>When, at length, it could only be heard indistinctly rumbling in the
distance, she again became collected. And when the bright sun came forth
anew, and laughed in joyously through the window of her apartment, she
arose, and looked out upon the cheerful earth, and her heart could not
withhold its sympathy. A feeling of delight, such as she had never before
experienced, gushed in upon her soul, and overpowered its faculties. As
in the morning, she opened the window, and threw herself on her knees
before it. The air kissed her fevered cheeks with the same balmy and
refreshing influence. &ldquo;Thou art merciful to thy children,&rdquo;
she exclaimed, &ldquo;oh thou Parent of the universe;&mdash;thy terrors
have passed by me, and I am not consumed;&mdash;once more am I permitted
to rejoice in thy smiles.&mdash;From henceforth I will know thee no more
as the terrible Great Spirit of the red men, but as 'Our Father who art
in Heaven.' &ldquo;</p>

<p>A gentle tap at the door of her apartment startled her&mdash;she
arose, and opened it. &ldquo;Dear aunt,&rdquo; she exclaimed, as the
person entered, &ldquo;I can now pronounce, with confidence, at least one
part of what you have taught me as the Apostles' Creed. I can say 'I
believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth.'
&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well, my daughter,&rdquo; said Yenacona, &ldquo;the
smoking flax will yet burst into flame, and the nations of the red men
will become the nations of God and of his Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Little Deer then proceeded to relate to her aunt the effects of
the recent storm upon her feelings, which Yenacona did all in her power
to enforce and perpetuate. &ldquo;I once heard some beautiful
verses,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;quite to the purpose, one of which I
remember&mdash;</p>

<p><br>
                         'God moves in a mysterious way,<br>
                         His wonders to perform;<br>
                         He plants his footsteps in the sea,<br>
                         And rides upon the storm.' &ldquo;<br>
</p>

<p>The fine voice of Yenacona gave to the harmony and exalted poetry of
the verse greatly increased effect, and, through their assistance, added
to the impression already made upon the feelings of her niece.</p>

<p>But the agitation of mind under which we have seen the Indian maid
laboring, did not arise alone from doubt respecting the Spring bath of
bitter herbs, or the terrible manner in which those doubts had been acted
upon.&mdash;No!&mdash;She had been for some time much harassed by the
interesting subject of religion, and her aunt, who had first called her
attention to it, was exceedingly active in pressing upon her those truths
which are recognised by all classes of Christians, as well as many of the
peculiar tenets of her own church. She had been for many months engaged
to the young brave of Eonee to become his bride, and the promise had been
made with the approval of both her heart and understanding. But while her
growing faith in the Christian religion was daily unsettling the
approbation of her understanding, a recent event seemed to demand a
reversal of the decision of her heart. She was in that state of nervous
irritability incident to the constant attrition upon her mind of these
interesting and perplexing subjects, at the time of her lover's return to
Tesumtoe. When Eoneguski, on that evening, glided from the presence of
Gideon and Yenacona, into the adjoining apartment, as he anticipated, he
found there the Little Deer. She was alone, but did not, according to his
expectation, advance to meet her young brave after so long a separation,
in affectionate confidence. On the contrary, when she heard the sound of
approaching footsteps, tremor seized upon her limbs, and they were no
longer adequate to her support; to save herself from falling, she sank
down into a chair, and, with her head leaning upon the back, was weeping
and sobbing. She did not even look up, as Eoneguski entered; who laid his
hand tenderly on her shoulder, and said, in an affectionate tone of
voice, &ldquo;Why does grief bow down the beautiful head of the Little
Deer, as do the heavy rain drops the blossoms of the lily?&mdash;But the
sun kisses away the rain drop from the lily&mdash;and shall not Eoneguski
dry up the tears that dim the bright eyes of the Little Deer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of soothing her, the Indian lover was surprised and mortified
to find that he was but opening anew the sources of her grief; for her
tears flowed faster, and her sobs became more deep and audible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can Eoneguski do,&rdquo; he inquired, after a pause,
&ldquo;to relieve the distresses of the Little Deer?&rdquo;&mdash;Still
he received no answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the presence of Eoneguski no longer pleasant to the Little
Deer?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have pity upon me,&rdquo; said the Little Deer, at length,
&ldquo;and do not afflict me with questions which I am now unable to
answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eoneguski folded his arms, and elevating himself to his full height,
looked for some moments steadfastly upon the interesting object before
him, with her long black hair dishevelled and hanging over her
beautifully formed neck and shoulders, now moved by convulsive heavings.
The strife of passions was in his soul, while melancholy composure sat
upon his countenance. At length he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;Eoneguski hath
returned from wanderings long, difficult, and dangerous&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me not of thy wanderings,&rdquo; interrupted the Little
Deer, &ldquo;they are grief to my soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; said the warrior, &ldquo;dost thou too condemn
me?&mdash;Said I not that the eye of the Evil Spirit was on the path of
Eoneguski?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do condemn thee, but it is with a bleeding heart,&rdquo;
replied the maiden, while she almost gasped for utterance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is kindness in thy voice,&rdquo; he said, mournfully,
&ldquo;and it is soothing to my soul;&mdash;it comes, as in former days,
like the plaintive note of the Wekolis, when he tells of the coming of a
happier season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; said the Indian girl, in a correspondent tone of
voice, &ldquo;that happiness has forever fled from the Little Deer, and
that the son of the Eonee chief, if he ever finds it, must seek for it
with some more fortunate maiden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say not so,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;the happiness of
Eoneguski is in the keeping of the Little Deer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can she who hath lost her own, be a safe depository of that
of another?&rdquo; she said, for the first time looking him in the face,
with a look as forcibly inquisitive as her question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She shall find it again;&rdquo; he replied&mdash;&ldquo;if the
conduct of Eoneguski hath displeased the Little Deer, let her hear his
reasons, and her gentle heart will exchange censure for
approbation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! I know not what to approve or what to censure;&rdquo; she
answered. &ldquo;I am now bewildered with doubts; when time shall have
solved them, I will listen and decide whether the fate of Eoneguski and
the Little Deer shall be one, or whether two separate paths must conduct
them through the journey of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Indian was startled. &ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo;&mdash;he inquired,
&ldquo;and does the fate of Eoneguski hang in balanced scales before the
eyes of the Little Deer?&mdash;To doubt is to decide!&mdash;If the heart
of the Little Deer was not changed towards Eoneguski, she would not speak
doubtfully of their being one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned, as if about to leave the
apartment&mdash;&ldquo;Eoneguski,&rdquo; she said, with more calmness
than she had yet manifested, &ldquo;you know nothing of what is passing
in the bosom of the Little Deer&mdash;act not with rashness, but wait
with patience the decision of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I to understand?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell me, at
once, in what hath Eoneguski changed in the estimation of the Little
Deer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A terrible strife,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;is going on in
the bosom of the Little Deer.&mdash;Wouldst thou crush the heart of one
you profess to love?&mdash;Then press me not now, for an answer to thy
questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Indian was perplexed. He stood for a moment thoughtfully, and then
replied&mdash;&ldquo;I said I have returned from wanderings long,
difficult, and dangerous&mdash;yet the Indian warrior laughs at fatigue
and danger. But the Evil Spirit cast his eye upon Eoneguski, and sorrow
and trouble came upon his soul&mdash;their clouds were dark and heavy.
'Let the storm descend,' I said, 'for the Little Deer is the sun in the
sky of Eoneguski, and her smiles will come upon him with their light and
warmth, and the shadows of evil will vanish away.' But I have come, and
the sun of my sky is dark&mdash;the cloud rests upon it, and it sends
forth no smile to cheer the heart of Eoneguski.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Little Deer could not resist the appeal. As in a stormy day,
through a rent in the opening clouds, the clear sunshine rests for a
moment on some solitary spot, gilding it with glory, while the dark
masses hover over the surrounding scenery, and closing again, hastily
snatch away the transitory and partial brightness, so did a transient
smile beam through the tears of the Little Deer upon her lover, and was
instantly succeeded by the former sadness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is enough,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;Eoneguski is contented. He
will come again when the clouds have passed away from the sun of his
sky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he left the Indian maiden to compose herself for an
interview with the stranger.</p>

<p>It is no wonder, then, that the simple and conscientious heart of the
Indian girl, strongly charged as it was with her national superstitions,
and for the displacement and succession of which the sublime truths of
Christianity were struggling, should have been so powerfully affected by
the storm we have described. The deductions drawn from it by her were
interwoven with the web of her destiny, and threw a complexion upon the
whole of her future conduct.</p>

<p>On the other hand, perplexing in the extreme were the speculations of
Eoneguski upon what was passing in the soul of the Little Deer. They
furnished much employment for his mind on his lonely journey to Eonee;
and of the various conjectures which he made, but one seemed, even to
himself, entitled to consideration. &ldquo;She loves me,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and her heart refuses to cast me off. But she has heard that I
have returned without the scalp of an enemy whose track I was pursuing,
and her pride disdains an alliance with the sluggard or the coward. The
proud daughter of Moytoy would match only with a hero. The Great Spirit
will yet teach the Little Deer that Eoneguski is neither a coward nor a
sluggard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The story of Gideon had satisfied Eoneguski that John Welch was one
whose life was protected from his vengeance by many of the strongest
considerations, and determined him to abandon the pursuit. Still there
was room for doubt; and the impressions made upon his mind were of too
delicate and important a nature to allow of their communication to those
most interested in their truth, until all doubt was removed. It was his
purpose to have seized the earliest opportunity of making them known to
Eonah, and taking his counsel and opinion. We have seen how that purpose
was frustrated for the present, leaving him in difficulty in his
interview with the Little Deer, and compelling him to withhold
explanations, which he conceived would have fully justified him in her
estimation. But a cautious regard for the happiness of others induced him
to submit to a present hardship, rather than relieve himself by causing
deep, affecting, and perhaps groundless excitement in others. &ldquo;But
John Welch,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;has been the Evil Spirit to me.
Why did he cross my path, causing its flowers to wither, and thorns to
spring up?&rdquo;</p>

<p align="right">BYRON.</p>

<p>TO watch by the bed of the dying is one of the most solemn and
affecting of relative duties, and exercises most powerfully the feelings
of the heart. The various sufferings, both of mind and body, which the
patient undergoes, keep sympathy continually awake; and a ray of hope
occasionally breaking through the thickest gloom, prevents the lethargy
despair would occasion. In the solemn stillness that pervades the
chamber, busy memory is left free to wander back over the path of former
intercourse, and gather up the incidents which mark the worth of the
dying, and endear him to the heart&mdash;while fancy is searching in the
gloom of the future for what must so soon become distressing reality.</p>

<p>When Eoneguski reached Eonee, he found every thing in a state of
gloomy excitement, and soon learned that his father was supposed to be
dying, and that the people were in that restless condition, by which a
swarm of bees indicate the absence of their sovereign, and their sense of
the necessity of speedily filling, with another, her vacated throne. He
flew to the wigwam of the dying chief, and the crowd gathered around the
door gave way at his approach. He threw himself on his knees, beside the
couch, but dared not give farther vent to his feelings, in the presence
of the stern countenances looking watchfully upon him.</p>

<p>The face of Eonah, during the short absence of his son, had become
much more haggard; his eyes, before quite dim, were now entirely
sightless; and the arm with which he had dealt his son the impotent blow,
lay nerveless beside him. Nothing but the moving of the chest, and a
snoring noise, like that of one sleeping, spoke any thing of life in the
once matchless warrior. But death seemed loath to complete his triumph,
and, for many hours, to pause in his advance. Meantime the dutiful savage
sat by his father, and ever and anon moistened his lips with a feather,
and an occasional drop of the fluid finding its way much lower,
refreshed, for a brief instant, his throat and palate. The hope that he
would ever again so far revive as to revoke the malediction which sat
distressingly upon the feelings of Eoneguski, it seemed folly to indulge;
and nothing was left to him but, with melancholy interest, to trim,
according to his limited skill, the lamp of life just glimmering in the
socket, and watch its progress toward final extinction. He learned that,
during his absence, the Saga had visited the chief, and after having
administered a few herbs, pronounced him entirely beyond his reach; and,
complaining of the infirmities of age, had returned immediately, to
repose himself in his wigwam at Sugar Town.</p>

<p>It was midnight, and Eoneguski, who had just risen from a brief nap,
dismissed Mercury to repose, to take his own turn of watching by the
dying chief. There was perfect silence in the hut, save the breathing of
Eonah, which was growing fainter and more faint.&mdash;Dim, very dim was
the light in the apartment, and the weary watcher, whose animal spirits
were subdued by multiplied afflictions, had sunk into that half sleeping
state, in which things real and imaginary form mingled and shifting
pictures before the mind.&mdash;He was standing, in fancy, near the banks
of the Homony, watching for Welch, and distinctly heard the low hissing
ripple of its waters: &ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; said he, starting, &ldquo;it
is the breathing of my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He again relapsed into the half unconscious state, and one of the
scenes of his earliest manhood was before him;&mdash;he was hunting deer
amongst his native mountains and valleys;&mdash;a stag was bounding, at
no great distance, unsuspectingly towards him;&mdash;he knew it by the
slow successive leaps with which the earth resounded.&mdash;The hunter
prepared for the slaughter of his noble game, and in so doing, jostled
his seat, and awoke himself.&mdash;It was his own heart, laboring under
the accumulation of half stagnated blood, he had heard.</p>

<p>Yet again he was in the land of shadows;&mdash;the Little Deer was
before him, as in their earliest acquaintance&mdash;when confidence was
between them;&mdash;she was in the wigwam of her mother, in the heat of a
summer's day, and her head had fallen back in gentle slumber against the
back of the chair whereon she sat.&mdash;He softly approached, and sunk
down on the ground beside her;&mdash;her head declined still lower, and,
among the thick masses of her long glossy hair, he was horror stricken at
beholding a venemous little serpent intertwined, fixing upon him its
bright fiery eyes, and threateningly licking out its forked
tongue.&mdash;He reached forth his hand to tear the serpent from the head
of the beloved one, and, as he attempted to seize it by the throat, it
fixed upon one of his fingers its poisonous fangs&mdash;The pain awoke
him, and he found himself stretched along by the fire, in his father's
wigwam, with a live coal near him. It was evident that, heavy with sleep,
he had slid down from his seat, and, under the impulse of fancy, having
stretched forth his arm, one of his fingers came in contact with the
fire.</p>

<p>He resumed his position, and, for a few moments, the slight pain of
the burn kept him awake. It soon, however, subsided, and again the
semi-transparent veil was let down over him. He was in the wigwam of
Eonah, watching the feverish slumbers of his dying father;&mdash;strength
had apparently deserted forever the limbs of the aged warrior, and they
lay upon his couch in more than infantile imbecility;&mdash;his eyelids
were half closed, as if in their last sleep, and the mouth lay widely
distended, that there might be no hindrance to the ingress and egress of
the unwilling breath.&mdash;Presently there was a quivering of the heavy
eyelids, and their curtains were drawn up from the dim sightless orbs
they had hitherto partially shaded;&mdash;the widely opened mouth closed
as by a mechanical spring;&mdash;the hitherto rigid nostrils began to
play in natural respiration, and the chief arose to a sitting
posture.</p>

<p>Eoneguski started, as he had done on former occasions, under the
impression that he was awaking from the mockery of a dream. But either
his senses were still the dupes of delusion, or he was witnessing nothing
less than a most surprising reality. There sat before him, in the dim
light, the aged chief, with open eyes, evidently striving to apply those
organs to their natural use. &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;&mdash;he said, in
a voice quite natural.</p>

<p>Eoneguski was greatly moved, but he was, as we have had occasion to
shew, a man of firmness, and hastened to relieve the solicitude of the
inquirer, by the answer, &ldquo;You are in your own wigwam at
Eonee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the voice of Eoneguski&mdash;of my only son,&rdquo; said
the chief.&mdash;&ldquo;They told me he was a recreant and a coward, but
I knew it was false&mdash;my young warrior hath returned, and his hand is
red with the blood of John Welch&mdash;dripping warm from his
scalp.&mdash;But fly to the Saga at Sugar Town, and tell him that the
angel of death has quitted his prey for a season&mdash;that Eonah yet
lives, and calls for the aid of the Great Medicine&mdash;fly&mdash;fly I
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Obedient to the paternal behest, Eoneguski woke up Mercury to attend
upon the chief, whilst he moved his sinewy limbs, and bent himself to
outstrip in speed the fabled Apollo, when he followed the flying
footsteps of the beautiful Daphne. He left behind him the shadows of
night when he arrived at the door of Susquanannacunahata, and made the
frail tenement shake with his impatient demand for admittance.</p>

<p>Wissa rose, muttering some unearthly sound of displeasure, and
proceeded to reconnoitre the person of the untimely visiter; but he no
sooner perceived who it was than every trace of displeasure faded from
his countenance, and the door was thrown open for him to enter. The Saga
opened his dim eyes, and turned them upon the visiter, who approached his
couch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who art thou,&rdquo; said the Saga.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Eoneguski,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou comest to the Saga,&rdquo; said the Prophet, &ldquo;to
pour flattery into his ears, that thou mayst be the chief of Eonee in the
room of the deceased Eonah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Spirit hath spared Eonah,&rdquo; replied the young
Indian, &ldquo;and Eoneguski is breathless with the haste in which he
hath flown to bring the Saga word, that he may snatch the prey from the
angel of death&mdash;Eonah says come and heal him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The suddenness of the information that Eonah was yet alive, deprived
Susquanannacunahata of his usual self-command; for, had he learnt that
one had actually arisen from the dead, his surprise could not have been
in reality greater, or more unequivocally expressed in his
countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thy brain is disordered, and thou dreamest,&rdquo; he
said.&mdash;&ldquo;The spirit of Eonah is in the land of the
blessed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not dream,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;but come thou and
stay the spirit of the aged warrior, while I fly back and tell him that
thou comest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is enough,&rdquo; said the Saga, &ldquo;I will
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eoneguski once more like the swift race horse devoured the ground
between Sugar Town and Eonee, and was soon again beside the couch of his
father. He was astonished to perceive him lying in seeming composure with
the powers of life wonderfully renovated, and having taken, as Mercury
informed him, a good deal of nourishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he come?&rdquo; said the chief, addressing Eoneguski.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the young man;&mdash;&ldquo;the feathers of
the aged eagle are few, and the strength of his wing is small&mdash;there
is no speed in his flight.&mdash;The sun, now high in the Heavens, must
be low ere the Saga will reach Eonee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must live to see him,&rdquo; said Eonah, composedly; and,
turning his face to the wall, signified that he desired silence, and soon
his chest was heaving with the full deep breathing of healthy sleep.</p>

<p>Meantime Wissa had prepared for the Saga his travelling vehicle, which
consisted of a cart drawn by two small aged oxen, which looked not as if
their food had been as visionary as the prognostications of their master.
It was impossible it should be so in the rich native pastures among which
they were allowed to stray with a freedom as unrestrained as those of the
ancient Tityrus, while their master, like him, expatiated in vaticinatory
dignity. The black boy was not long in arranging the simple geer, which
consisted of a yoke only, with a withe attached to it, through which the
tongue of the cart protruded, and to which it was very inartificially
secured. Blankets and buffalo skins formed for the Prophet a comfortable
couch in the body of the car, and in this primitive style, with Wissa for
his charioteer, he proceeded to Eonee.</p>

<p>As Eoneguski had anticipated, the sun was low when he reached his
place of destination; for his slow paced cattle were left very far behind
by the winged steeds of Phoebus. It was difficult to say which was the
nearest death, the patient or the physician; as, exhausted by his
journey, the Saga was borne in on his couch, and laid down by the side of
Eonah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does not the Great Medicine heal himself?&rdquo; said the
latter, sarcastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Age is a disease,&rdquo; said the Saga, in a tone of voice
scarcely beyond a whisper, &ldquo;that defies the art of the greatest
Medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou hast done wonders for Eonah,&rdquo; continued the
chief;&mdash;&ldquo;thou art doubtless rejoiced to have snatched him from
the grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the Great Spirit who gives power to the Medicine,&rdquo;
replied the Saga, still faintly, &ldquo;and it is to him that life and
death belong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Eonah, &ldquo;and thou knowest
Susquanannacunahata&mdash;thou hast reason to know&mdash;that he can
impart a healing influence to what was intended to destroy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He signed for all but the Saga, Eoneguski and Wissa to leave the
wigwam. The signal was obeyed, and the door closed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I have long known thee,
Susquanannacunahata&mdash;and I knew that thou hatest me, because I knew
thee; but I dreamed not that thou wouldst poison the cup of him who
trusted thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Conscious guilt put its seal upon the time-worn face of the Saga as he
assayed to deny with his tongue what his looks confessed.
&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; said he, while the words trembled upon his lips,
&ldquo;remember Eonah where thou now liest&mdash;cheat not thyself with
the hope of life;&mdash;thou art on thy bed of death&mdash;lie not then
in the presence of its angel.&mdash;Stain not thy own soul with
falsehood, that thou may'st dishonor these hairs which are bleached with
the dews of more than twelve hundred moons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eonah does not cheat himself with the hope of life,&rdquo;
replied the chief; &ldquo;he feels that he is hastening to the hunting
grounds of the blessed; but in the presence of the angel of death he
charges the Saga of Sugar Town with putting poison in the sick man's
cup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The charge disproves itself:&rdquo; said the
Saga&mdash;&ldquo;Art thou not alive, and better than when the Saga came
to thy door?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; replied Eonah, &ldquo;but it is not to thee
I am indebted for it; another hand threw in the antidote, (the Saga
turned his eyes suddenly upon Wissa, who sat with the dull unapprehensive
look of one who is deaf,) where thine had deposited the poison.&mdash;But
fear not; Eonah, as we have said, is hastening to join the ghosts of his
fathers, and thirsts not for vengeance. Thy guilt shall be buried in the
grave of Eonah, and in the faithful bosom of Eoneguski, upon one
condition.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>A gleam of joy flitted across the dark gloomy features of the Saga, as
he listened for the condition&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hearts of the Eonee,&rdquo; continued the chief, &ldquo;are
in the hands of the Saga&mdash;let him turn them towards Eoneguski, as
their chief, when Eonah shall sleep in quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hands of the Saga are pure from the guilt imputed to
him,&rdquo; replied the Prophet.&mdash;&ldquo;Nay, does he not love the
race of Eonah? and who but Eoneguski could he desire to see as the chief
of the Eonee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said the chief; &ldquo;let the heads of the
people hear thee express, in our presence, the wish that Eoneguski shall
be the chief of the Eonee when his sire is no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old Prophet assayed to speak, but the words he uttered, if any,
were not heard, and, in an instant, more than a dozen of the principal
aged men of Eonee were in the wigwam of their chief. Among them was
Chuheluh. Raising himself on his couch, with an animation which greatly
surprised them, Eonah addressed the assembled elders:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fathers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the bow of the warrior is
unstrung;&mdash;his arrows are broken, and his tomahawk and
scalping-knife are dull.&mdash;Fathers, Eonah is no longer wise in
council, nor valiant in fight&mdash;the feathers are no longer in the
wing of the Eagle, and the teeth of the Lion are broken. Let the brave
repose where sleep the fathers of his race, after the ancient manner of
the Oewoehee.&mdash;But who shall henceforth lead you in the
chase?&mdash;Who shall be the first among you in the strife of the manly
ball play?&mdash;Who shall lead the dance at the joyous feast of the
early roasting-ear?&mdash;Whose shout shall be heard the first and the
loudest among the Eonee when they gather with the rest of the Oewoehee to
the feast of battle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A melancholy murmur ran through the assembly as the speaker paused,
and turned his sightless eyes in every direction&mdash;&ldquo;The blood
of Eonah,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;runs in the veins of
Eoneguski;&mdash;he will be wise in council, and valiant in battle, like
his sire. The Saga hath said it is the will of the Great Spirit that the
young brave shall be the chief of the Eonee, when the sun of Eonah has
set?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every eye was turned upon the Saga, expecting him to speak, but he was
silent. After waiting for some moments&mdash;&ldquo;Is the Saga in the
wigwam?&rdquo; inquired Eonah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; answered several voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has the heart of the Saga changed?&mdash;Let him
remember,&rdquo;&mdash;he said, in a tone of warning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Saga changes not,&rdquo;&mdash;was the reply, with a
stammering voice. He was about to proceed, but his eye caught that of
Chuheluh, and there was something in the look of the latter that did not
escape the notice of even the dim vision of the Saga, and his speech was
checked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eonah is yet alive,&rdquo; cried the impatient
chief.&mdash;&ldquo;Is it the will of Heaven that Eoneguski should be the
chief of the Eonee, or that another should die the death of an
assassin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the will of Heaven,&rdquo; said the Saga, closing his
eyes in desperation, like the bull when he rushes madly on those who
provoke him to conflict&mdash;&ldquo;It is the will of Heaven that
Eoneguski should be the chief of the Eonee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Susquanannacunahata is a false-hearted villain!&rdquo; cried a
voice in the throng.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slay the impious wretch!&rdquo;&mdash;cried
another.&mdash;&ldquo;Who dares to charge the Great Prophet and Medicine
with villany?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many hands were ready to execute the sentence, but no one could tell
who was the offender; suspicion, however, rested on Chuheluh, for he, who
had but a few minutes before constituted one of the members of the
assembly, was no where to be seen.</p>

<p>The rest of the elders approached, one by one, the bed of their dying
chief, and taking, as they were conscious, a last look of their leader in
many a scene of mirth and danger, retired in melancholy silence.</p>

<p>When they were all gone&mdash;&ldquo;Does Eonah,&rdquo; inquired the
Saga, &ldquo;desire that Susquanannacunahata should prepare any thing for
the infirmities of his body?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dealings of Eonah and Susquanannacunahata are finished in
this life,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Susquanannacunahata may return to his wigwam at Sugar
Town?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may,&rdquo; replied Eonah, &ldquo;but first let him give me
his hand&mdash;let us part as those who have shared together the couch
and the cup&mdash;the wigwam and the battle field&mdash;the love of the
customs of our brave fathers&mdash;and a bitter hatred of the pale
faces.&mdash;Eonah despises villany, but in spite of it he respects a
brave man.&mdash;We part, Susquanannacunahata, yet it is but as the sun
sets to rise on the morrow.&mdash;Soon&mdash;very soon, we shall meet to
part no more&mdash;for Eonah is on his bed of death&mdash;and yet
Susquanannnacunahata will be the first to sing his death-song.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ceased, and the Saga was conducted in silence to his car, and soon
its wheels were heard slowly creaking, as Wissa urged with a goad the
tardy cattle.</p>

<p>When they were left alone in the hut&mdash;&ldquo;Did I not tell
you,&rdquo; said Eonah to Eoneguski, &ldquo;he was a villain.&mdash;I saw
him cast the poison into the cup he gave me, but it was not unexpected,
and the same person who prepared me for the deed, cast in the antidote to
obviate its effects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A good deal of conversation passed between the father and son, son,
which it is beside our purpose to relate; suffice it to say, that Eonah
made no allusion to the harshness with which he had treated Eoneguski,
and the latter had the satisfaction of believing that it was the act of a
moment of mental incoherency, and had retained no place in the memory of
the old chief.</p>

<p align="right">YAMOYDEN.</p>

<p>THERE is nothing so humbling to human pride as detected baseness, and
the higher the previous pretensions of the malefactor, the more galling
and intolerable the vengeance with which his own pride visits him. There
are thousands in the world whose only restraint from guilt is the fear of
its detection by men&mdash;utterly unmindful of that sleepless eye which
spies out all their actions. Save only as this fear may disturb their
quiet, many pass through the successive days of a long life with perfect
composure in the commission of crimes most revolting to virtue, who are
driven to desperation and suicide by the disclosure of the smallest of
their villanies. They are seized with the sorrow which, saith the
Scriptures, worketh death, and nothing can alleviate it but
self-destruction, or a deeper plunge into open and shameless
wickedness.</p>

<p>Such was the scorpion preying on the heart of the Saga, as he was
pursuing his way homeward, with no company but that of the dumb Wissa. It
was night, and the moon had not risen&mdash;a balmy air was blowing
freshly from the south, being nearly the direction in which they were
travelling, but a sudden turn in the road on the descent of a hill of
some length, threw them facing, as it were, to the right about. All at
once the glimmering reflection of a bright light was perceptible before
them;&mdash;Wissa pointed it out to the Saga; but it was a subject upon
which they could not well exchange their thoughts by signs, and it
remained therefore for each to speculate as he might upon what
considerably surprised them both. But they had not much time for
speculation, for the Saga presently heard behind him the roaring sound of
a conflagration, and looking back beheld a sheet of flame descending the
hill above them in swift pursuit. He did not make the discovery sooner
than Wissa, whose quicker eye placed him pretty nearly on an equality
with his master, who supposed himself in the exclusive possession, as
between them, of the faculty of hearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire! master,&rdquo; cried Wissa; possibly like the younger
Croesus, impelled by a sense of imminent danger to exert a force
sufficient to rupture the bonds by which his tongue had been so long held
in confinement.</p>

<p>Much as the Saga was moved by the immediate danger that threatened
him, he was for an instant scarcely conscious of it, so much was he
affected at hearing an articulate sound from the lips of the dumb.
Wissa's first idea was to urge the cattle to a speed which might outrun
the flames, and the animals themselves were not so unconscious of danger
as to be backward in obeying the incitements which Wissa dealt them
thickly <i>en croupe.</i></p>

<p>They struck off in an awkward run, and the cart once getting fairly in
motion, from the natural effect of gravitation, became impatient of the
yet slow gait of the cattle, and pressing forcibly upon them, united with
Wissa in urging them to greater exertions. For a time they resisted with
native stubbornness this new impulse, but finding it at length too
powerful, they scampered away, no longer mindful of their direction,
which they regulated, like running water, by the descent of the hill.
Wissa finding his seat on the front part of the cart no longer tenable,
yielded to his fate, and narrowly escaped, as he fell, being run over by
one or both wheels. Although not projected from a height near so great,
he was in danger, like another Ph&aelig;ton, of suffering from intense
heat, to escape which, he no sooner touched the ground than he arose and
took security of his heels.</p>

<p>Thundering down the precipitous hill side with his now ungoverned
oxen, the Saga's bed was no longer one of &ldquo;thrice driven
down.&rdquo;&mdash;Jostled from side to side in his clumsy vehicle, his
aged bones were nearly dislocated, and he felt himself every instant as
trembling upon the verge of fate. At length one of the wheels encountered
a large rock, and that side of the cart was carried up many feet from the
ground, projecting the Saga with nearly the force of a rocket, and
sending him to find a rough resting place upon a bed of stones. Here,
bruised and mangled, he met a sudden and unlooked for termination to his
journey, and fancied it the end of his earthly career. He lay uttering
groans of agony, which, at length, arrested the attention of Wissa, who
having placed himself where the direction of the fire no longer
endangered his own person, became properly solicitous for the fate of his
master. Having found him in his battered and helpless condition, his next
concern was to strive for the recovery of their cart and oxen. He was not
long in finding the former by the light of the fire, though truly in a
wretched condition; but of the oxen he could neither see nor hear either
hair or hide, hoof or horn.</p>

<p>Having now acquired the use of speech, and finding that alone he could
do but little for the comfort of his wounded master, he sallied out in
search of assistance, and after a time succeeded in collecting three or
four Indians, whose superstitious reverence for the Saga, (more than
doubled by the supposed miracle of speech being given to the dumb to meet
his necessities,) inspired them with alacrity in his service. They were
not long in constructing a hurdle, and having gathered up his scattered
couch, formed quite an easy conveyance for the mangled Seer, on which
they transported him to his wigwam in Sugar Town, in less time than he
could have reached it in his slow-moving wain.</p>

<p>For several days he here lingered out a painful existence, suffering
under the complicated misery of bodily wounds and bruises of the spirit.
Not a gleam of hope cheered the gloom of the prospect before him. Like an
aged tree, time had but strengthened his hold upon the soil where he was
rooted, and great must be the force that could wrench him from it. But of
that force he now felt the application, and fearful was the cracking of
the aged fibres. The retrospect of his life presented nothing to console
him, and conscience was loud in her demands for atonement to many who had
been the victims of his fraud and violence. Many of those, alas, had long
since passed beyond the reach of his offices of atonement, and for his
wrongs to them his system of religion furnished no means of appeasing the
clamors of conscience. But even his unenlightened mind dictated
retribution to all those to whom it was yet in his power to make it, and,
late as it was, to one at least&mdash;the most innocent and wronged among
the many whom he had visited with affliction&mdash;he resolved to send
and pour the only balm in his power into a long festering wound. Yet was
it with reluctance that he adopted this determination, and consented to
abandon the further prosecution of a revenge, which had, for years past,
been his living principle of action. His purpose was not carried into
execution until just at the moment when, by the fiat of that very demon
at whose altar he had so devoutly ministered his dark spirit, and the
body it had actuated for a century, were about to dissolve forever their
unholy union.</p>

<p>SOWING in deceit, and reaping in sorrow, seem to follow each other, as
natural consequences, and one or the other of these unprofitable
employments occupies most of the time of a large portion of our race. But
these moral processes differ widely from the physical ones we make use of
to typify them, in the absence, in the one, of those regular periods
which mark the other. In the former it often happens that one man is
sowing his invisible seed, at the same moment that another is reaping his
crop of ruin.</p>

<p>This was the case with Gideon Aymor and the Saga at Sugar Town; and
while the latter was, in bitterness of soul, gathering in the destructive
harvest of a life of fraud, the former was busily sowing in deceit and
treachery. We left him under the auspices of Yenacona, resolved to win
and wear the Little Deer, if he could, regardless of her plighted troth,
and his own obligations to Eoneguski. The undertaking seemed to have
inspired the singular devotee herself with new life and energy, and she
embarked at once deeply in the cause. Nor was Gideon himself either slow
or skilful in assailing and besieging, by turns, that disturbed
citadel&mdash;the heart of the swarthy beauty. But little time, however,
elapsed, before a serious interruption took place in the plans of the
confederates.</p>

<p>The evening succeeding that on which they had entered into their
stormy alliance, two Africans arrived at Tesumtoe&mdash;the one as envoy
to Gideon, and the other to Yenacona. Gideon, in his, at once recognised
Mercury, who had come from Eoneguski to request his immediate presence at
Eonee, at the last rites with which the remains of Eonah were to be
honored. He felt that it was an invitation he could not, with propriety,
disregard, however reluctant he might be to abandon his present highly
advantageous position. But as the rites were not to be performed until
the third day, he had yet some hours, during which he might remain at
Tesumtoe. He soon discovered that the tidings of the other messenger,
whatever they might be, powerfully affected both his hostess and her
niece. They had hurried meetings, and as quickly separated, each
repairing to her own apartment.&mdash;Again they might be seen restlessly
flitting hither and thither, with handkerchiefs at their faces, while
neither of them, as usual, favored him with her company. His curiosity
was excited, and he strove to gather something from Mercury to satisfy
it. But Mercury could afford him no relief.</p>

<p>The night passed away restlessly, and Gideon was not a little
surprised at receiving a very early summons to visit Yenacona in her own
apartment. Obeying it, with haste, he was struck, as he entered, with a
great change in her appearance. She was clothed in deep rich mourning,
and it was evident that much of her time, since he last saw her, had been
spent in weeping, yet her countenance was less dejected than usual; there
was on her cheek a feverish flush, and the light of some new hope was
kindled in her eye. She had just risen from her morning devotions, for
the time-worn cushion beside her still bore the impressions of her knees,
and an ancient breviary lay not far distant. She made a sign to Aymor to
be seated. &ldquo;I am sorry to hear,&rdquo; she said, in the most
touching tone of her sweet melancholy voice, &ldquo;that Mr. Aymor is
about to leave us for a time;&mdash;for a time, did I say?&mdash;it may
be forever&mdash;for in this uncertain world, how difficult is it for
friends, once separated, to meet again, even when that awful distinction
which divides the living from the dead has not passed between
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot be less sorry than yourself,&rdquo; said Gideon,
&ldquo;for the loss will be entirely on my side; but I trust our
separation will be, indeed, a short one.&mdash;Remember,&rdquo; he added,
with an attempt at gayety, &ldquo;that the conquest of the heart of the
Little Deer is not yet achieved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks to St. Tamany,&rdquo; she replied, clasping her hands
devoutly, and then crossing herself several times, &ldquo;the
insurmountable obstacle to the union of Eoneguski and the Little Deer
does not exist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gideon colored with surprise and vexation. &ldquo;And is this your
engagement to befriend me in my suit,&rdquo; he said, a little angrily,
&ldquo;that you rejoice in the brightening prospects of my
rival?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why should I not rejoice?&rdquo; she almost yelled.
&ldquo;Mr. Aymor, she continued, with more calmness, &ldquo;you are not a
father, and even if you were, you could then but faintly conceive the
deep affection which binds the mother to her offspring. Turn not upon
her, then, the look of displeasure, if joy is stirred in her heart, which
has yearned with a mother's longings for her first and only born, when
she finds contradicted the cruel story that his blood had been poured
out, to allay the unappeaseable thirst of the devouring flame, or the
vengeance of a relentless foe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wild emotion that accompanied the latter part of what was thus
uttered, confounded Gideon, and suggested to him the oft adopted, and as
frequently dismissed, idea, that the person in whose presence he sat was
a lunatic. He was silent. She threw her keen eyes upon him, and seemed to
look into his very soul. &ldquo;I know your thoughts, Mr. Aymor,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;but I pardon you.&mdash;Yes, the brain of Yenacona is
unsettled&mdash;and well it may be.&mdash;It was that you might learn the
story of her woes, I have sent for you.&mdash;You will change anger for
pity, when you shall hear my sufferings. But it is not to seek your
useless compassion that I trouble you.&mdash;No! Mr. Aymor, there is one
earthly comfort, (it may be yet within my reach,) for which my soul
panteth, as doth the hart after the water brooks; and it is with the hope
that you may assist me in finding my lost one, I afflict you with the
rehearsal of my sad story. You will be surprised to learn that,
notwithstanding the usual longevity of the Indian, and the security which
that blood commonly possesses against the early inroads of time upon the
constitution, I have not yet attained my fiftieth year. It was not time
who stole from these locks their original blackness;&mdash;it was the
effect of horror and complicated grief, when I had realized less than
twenty times the promise of the everlasting Father, that there should be
a regular succession of seed time and harvest. But if my poor brain will
suffer it,&rdquo; she said, pressing her hands strongly against her head
for some moments, like one in agony, &ldquo;I will give you a short
recital of my origin and wretched life. It may aid you in the discovery
of my poor lost one, should the hand of Providence hereafter cast you
together,&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was too much interest in the person, her manner, and the
circumstances under which he was addressed, for Gideon to decline
listening to the proposed recital; and Yenacona, perceiving he would be
no heedless auditor, proceeded, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_11">YENACONA'S STORY.</a></h3>

<p>&ldquo;Something more than fifty years ago, two powerful sovereigns of
Europe, whose ancestors had been contending, during centuries, for
supremacy in the old world, having formed a new and wider field for
strife in the transatlantic home of the red men, were struggling
together, each for its exclusive possession, with a fury which had been
the growth of ages, nurtured by an almost uninterrupted series of mutual
wrongs. Each, in his turn, courted the aid of the warlike natives in his
war of extermination against his white brother.&mdash;The simple red men
did not spurn proposals, that they should shed their blood, and throw
away their lives, for the gratification and aggrandizement of those who
had treacherously driven them from the graves of their fathers, and taken
possession of the very spots where once smoked their ancestral
hearths.&mdash;No! they lent a willing ear to these solicitations, and
yelled with a thirst of blood, common to them, with their seducers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet think not the red men were unconscious of the arts
practised upon them, or that they were viewed by their employers as
dupes, whose blind facility they despised, while they turned it to their
own purposes.&mdash;No! they saw, indeed, that they were led as sheep to
the slaughter&mdash;but it was not with the heart of sheep they came to
the shambles. Their bosoms burned with indignation nearly equal against
those who led them to the place of slaughter, and those by whom they were
actually slain. But they saw that the day of the red men had passed away,
and that their tribes, numerous as they were, could not stand against the
united power of the whites. In craft, then, and not in blind facility or
weak simplicity, did they cherish the feuds of their enemies. They hoped,
by partaking in their quarrel, to make them the means of destroying each
other, that the ultimate conqueror might be, in turn, subdued by the
rightful proprietors of the land. But disunion, and want of concert in
opinion and action, marred, with them, as they have often done, and will
yet do again, the plans of wiser people, and were the ostensible causes
of the failure of their success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On one side floated the oriflamme of France, and on the other
the lion of England; and each of the numerous Indian tribes, according to
their fancy, gathered to the waving of the broad silken folds of the one
or the other, according as they were moved by the thousand mysterious
workings of the human heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would have been the result had all the tribes of the red
men united themselves with one only of the contending parties, can be
known to Him alone in whose eye there is neither past nor future.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moytoy, then, wore the four scalps and five eagles' tails, the
diadem or emblem of royalty of the Oewoehee, and sixty times one hundred
warriors were obedient to his voice. But the pride of Moytoy was not in
his diadem, or the number of his warriors.&mdash;It was in his two brave
sons, Toleniska and Attacallaculla. Moytoy espoused the quarrel of
England, and sent his son Toleniska with a portion of his warriors to
battle, while he himself, time honored, remained at home with his younger
son, Attacallaculla, and the rest of his people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far to the northward of us two streams meet, after having
wandered by a winding way for countless miles, the one from the north,
called the Alleghany, and the other from the south, called the
Monongahela; uniting, they form a noble river, and rush on to swell the
glory of the father of waters. Where those two streams meet, the armies
of France found a place of strength, and from hence it became the desire
of the English to expel them. An accomplished General came for the
purpose from that distant land, and headed the forces of England, aided
by a few Anglo-American officers, among whom was one since known to the
red men as their&mdash;Father Washington.</p>

<p>There were many Indian warriors in the service of France, and they
were scattered in ambush around the place of strength. The British
General was ignorant of the arts of savage warfare, and mistook quiet for
safety. But Father Washington was no stranger to the customs of the red
men, and modestly offered to the General a word of suggestion&mdash;but
it was repelled with insult. Toleniska heard what had happened&mdash;he
knew that Washington was right, and that the thousands, both of white and
red men, upon whom their young leader looked round with confidence, were
conducted by his rashness within the very jaws of destruction. But a
voice more powerful than his had been disregarded, and he was silent. It
is not for me to describe the scene that followed, suffice it to say,
that the followers of Toleniska, with their white allies, were mowed down
by a few Indians in ambush, like the ripe grain in harvest, and the
survivors, like sheep scattered in the wilderness, were left to perish or
find their way home deprived of their brave, but rash and inexperienced
leader.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The desire of spoil, for the gratification of which ample means
lay scattered around them, prevented the victorious Indians from pursuing
their routed adversaries; so that the Cherokees had, in their turn,
opportunities of indulging their native desire of pillage&mdash;and
although vanquished, they returned home not spoiled, but spoilers. All
whom they encountered, who had the misfortune to bear upon their tongues
the French accent, became the subjects of their furious vengeance, and
they left many bloody hearthstones and smoking ruins behind them, while
they bore away spoil, scalps, and prisoners. In passing through the State
of Virginia, their mistaken zeal for the English led them to the
destruction of a few French families there settled in peace and
quietness, little dreaming of the horrors impending over them. Their
neighbors, outraged by this deed of violence, pursued the Cherokees to
avenge their blood. The unconscious savages were no less surprised than
their recent victims, at finding themselves so unexpectedly attacked by
those in whose cause they supposed their late violence to have been
committed, and lost more in killed and wounded by the hands of their
friends, than they had done by the hostile Indians. Those who escaped
came home, some of them bloody, and all of them frantic with a rage,
which first indicated itself in a proposal to subject to the torture the
few prisoners they retained. The satisfaction with which this proposal
was received, was manifested by yells of savage triumph. Preparations
were immediately made for the consummation of the fell purpose, and the
venerable Moytoy himself presided at the bloody
sacrifice.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>Yenacona became greatly moved, and paused to collect
herself&mdash;&ldquo;The prisoners,&rdquo; she at length proceeded,
&ldquo;were brought forth, and again the air was rent with yells of
ferocious joy. Among them was a delicate, fair haired girl, pale and
drooping as a flower long plucked from its parent stem. The horror of the
scene did not arouse her from a state of unconsciousness, in which she
was sustained upon her feet only by the rough grasp of those who were
thirsting for her blood. The rest of the prisoners were all of the
stronger sex, and, therefore, could have substracted nothing from the
pity which, by gentle bosoms, would have been yielded without measure to
the innocent creature, who, apparently in the sixteenth summer of her
being, was about to perish by a cruel and lingering death, without a tear
of sympathy or a look of compassion to sooth her anguish. The other
victims had been stripped, that nothing might interfere with the modes of
torture which the malice or ingenuity of the savage group might
suggest.&mdash;An unceremonious hand was laid upon the unresisting girl
for the same purpose.&mdash;'Hold!'&mdash;shouted a manly
voice.&mdash;'Stand back, ye inhuman savages, and profane her not by your
touch!'</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tall figure rushed from among the crowd, and forcing back the
persons who held her, received into his arms the passive and almost
lifeless maiden&mdash;'Behold!'&mdash;he said, 'Behold&mdash;the bride of
Attacallaculla&mdash;and touch her not on the peril of your
lives.'&mdash;The blood-thirsty savages made a rush to reclaim their
victim, but Attacallaculla, with a blow of his tomahawk, stretched at his
feet one of her assailants, and checked the advance of his
associates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All was now confusion, and every eye was turned upon Moytoy,
whose tongue was chained in astonishment. Attacallaculla, suddenly
recollecting himself, dropped upon his knee before his father, and
acknowledged, penitentially, his breach of the deference due to
him.&mdash;'But my father will not deny the maiden to his son?' he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A general cry from the barbarian throng, that the victims
should be sacrificed without exception, prevented any relentings which
Moytoy might have indulged in favor of his son, and he therefore sternly
commanded him to surrender the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo; 'Never!' exclaimed Attacallaculla firmly, 'Never while the
heart of the young warrior beats with love and valor!'</p>

<p>&ldquo; 'Then force must overcome thy rashness,' said Moytoy,
angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo; 'Hear me, but once,'&mdash;said Attacallaculla,
composedly.&mdash;'I know that my single arm is no match for your
legions, and that you have the power to snatch this maiden by force from
my embrace&mdash;but you can never, against my will, convey her to the
torture.&mdash;The knife of Attacallaculla is sharp,'&mdash;he said, as
he held up the keen and glittering blade with a triumphant smile, 'and
can, in an instant, dismiss the soul of the maiden where your power
cannot reach her.&mdash;And think you the spirit of Attacallaculla would
linger behind her?&mdash;No! no!' he shouted, 'it should wing its way
with hers to the land of the blessed, where none would be found so cruel
as to part us.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toleniska now interposed, and prevailed upon the people and his
father to yield to the passion of Attacallaculla, and proceed with the
sacrifice of the other victims. The prospect it afforded of a more speedy
gratification of their own cruel longings, made more acceptable to the
people a course which the popularity of Attacallaculla with themselves,
and the alarmed affection of Moytoy for his son, inclined all parties to
adopt.</p>

<p>Attacallaculla bore the maiden off in triumph to his wigwam, while the
rest of the party proceeded with their feast of vengeance; and the
shrieks and groans of agony that burst from the victims, were mingled
with the shouts of hellish joy uttered by their tormentors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was long ere the stranger awoke to a knowledge of what had
transpired in many of the past weeks of her existence, and for that
knowledge she was dependant entirely upon the information of others.
Memory had no record of any event, since, at one fell swoop, she had seen
her whole family a prey to the destroyers.</p>

<p>Attacallaculla, whilst he did every thing in his power for her
comfort, avoided any allusion to her becoming his wife, until time had
taken away the freshness of those wounds with which her heart was
bleeding: and when he did at length speak to her of love, the marked
disgust it inspired was no way flattering to his pride, while it gave a
new impulse to her tide of grief. In time, however, she remembered her
paternal home as a tale that is told;&mdash;the voices to which her ear
had in former times vibrated with joy, were now still in death;&mdash;and
the roof that once echoed to their sounds, had been given to the flames.
She listened to the story of her gallant rescue from the tormentors, and
was convinced that the noble pulses of love and valor might be as strong
beneath the skin of the red man, as of the white. To Attacallaculla she
owed her existence&mdash;he was of the first among the people to whom she
was united, with but little to induce a desire of severance; and she at
length consented upon one condition to become his wife. This condition
was that they should be married according to the rites of her own
religion&mdash;the holy Catholic faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great difficulty was thus thrown in the way of
Attacallaculla, but he resolved to surmount it. He set out for
Charleston, in the State of South Carolina, and soon returned, bringing
with him a priest of the true faith; who, after having administered to
the ghostly comfort of Maria, (for that was her name,) united her in the
holy estate of matrimony with the preserver of her life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These were the parents of Yenacona.&mdash;Maria proved to be no
portionless wife to Attacallaculla. All the treasures, amounting to a
large sum, which had been purloined by the Indians from the house of her
father, were justly declared to be hers, and, among them, were the jewels
you have seen worn by the Little Deer and myself.&mdash;Behold the most
precious of them all,&rdquo;&mdash;she said, applying her lips to the
crucifix; &ldquo;nor must this holy book be forgotten,&rdquo; she added,
laying her hand on the ancient silver clasped breviary.&mdash;She paused
a moment, and then continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For some time happiness, at least on the part of
Attacallaculla, dwelt in his wigwam, and Maria bore her lot with
calmness, if not with cheerfulness. My birth gave rise to the first
difference between them&mdash;my father insisting on my bearing the name
of Yenacona, in honor of a Cherokee festival, so called, during which I
came into existence, and my mother preferring the Christian one, and her
own, of Maria. But her gentle spirit was forced to yield, and, painful as
it was, she allowed her daughter to be called by the heathen name of
Yenacona.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A difference of a more serious character followed a few years
afterwards. My father, according to the practice of his people, who see
no impropriety in polygamy, desired to increase his household with
another wife. My mother was of course shocked at the proposal, and did
every thing in her power to prevent this overthrow of her peace; but her
efforts were unavailing, and, the same day that another wife was
introduced into the wigwam of Attacallaculla, Maria left it a homeless
wanderer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toleniska was indignant at the conduct of his brother, and took
me to his own wigwam, where he treated me with a father's tenderness,
Attacallaculla being too much interested in his new connexion to concern
himself much respecting either my mother or myself. For some years I
lived in as much comfort in the house of my uncle as my family
afflictions would allow. I had a distinct and kind remembrance of my
absent parent, and felt the most anxious solicitude respecting her fate.
Nor was I indifferent to my father, whose neglect distressed and
mortified me. But Toleniska did all in his power to win me from the
remembrance of my sorrows, and direct, to new objects, the affections of
my heart. His efforts were at first kind and well directed, but false
notions of the character and rights of our illfated sex, often lead those
to whose care it is committed, in zeal for its supposed welfare and
happiness, to practice upon it the most intolerable cruelty. The stream
of existence which would probably have otherwise flowed peacefully in an
onward course, is, by ill-judged interference, turned out of its regular
current, deviating first to the right, and then to the left, encountering
obstacles against which it chafes and lashes, and agitated, turbid and
muddy, it rushes headlong with accelerated impetuosity to the end of its
troubled course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She ceased for a moment, and seemed lost in reflection.</p>

<p align="right">YAMOYDEN.</p>

<p>&ldquo;WHAT would have been the tenor of Yenacona's life,&rdquo; she
at length proceeded, &ldquo;but for the ill-advised solicitude of
Toleniska in her behalf, it is impossible to know; but that gave
direction to all its subsequent destiny, and heaped upon her distresses
which few could have borne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The attack suffered by the Cherokees, already mentioned, in
their passage through Virginia, had so exasperated them, that frequent
skirmishes from thenceforth took place between them and the whites, in
which a conspicuous part was taken by Toleniska, Eonah, (the chief of the
Eonee,) and Soquilla, (a distinguished man among the people of Sugar
Town.) These were continued for ten or twelve years, until the boundary
line, eastward of the Indian hunting grounds, was run by Tryon, the
Governor, or as he was called by the red men, the Great Wolf of North
Carolina. Then, as they say, the tomahawk was buried, and the peace pipe
was smoked by the red men with their white brothers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An intimacy of the closest kind sprung up in the meantime among
these three chiefs, and I frequently saw Eonah and Soquilla at the wigwam
of Toleniska. Soquilla was already an old man, older than either Eonah or
Toleniska; but he cast eyes of love upon the young Yenacona, almost as
soon as she had passed the age of childhood. Strange as it may seem, it
met the wishes of Toleniska, that she should become his wife, and they
did not think it necessary to inquire whether or not it was acceptable to
her. Without consulting her it was settled between them, that whenever
she should attain sufficient age, she was to become the wife of Soquilla.
Soquilla did not neglect means to make himself agreeable to Yenacona, and
she was not ignorant of his expectations; but delicacy and diffidence
prevented her from speaking of what was never distinctly proposed to her.
Perhaps she was to blame in not boldly avowing her determination never to
become the wife of Soquilla.&mdash;By it she might have been saved much
sorrow; but maidenly modesty is her only apology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time passed on, and Soquilla demanded that he might lead
Yenacona to his wigwam as his wife. Toleniska assented, and then, for the
first time, the proposal was formally made her. A prompt negative was her
unexpected answer, and both Toleniska and Soquilla were petrified with
surprise;&mdash;for the Cherokee girls are wont to submit very implicitly
in these matters to the wishes of their friends. The latter complained of
ill-usage in having his suit so long entertained to be at last dismissed,
while the former talked much of parental authority, and the duty of
obedience. Both chiefs were violent and passionate, and I was seriously
alarmed for the consequences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was no longer safe in my uncle's house, and I knew it would
be vain to seek an asylum in that of my father. All the tenderness of
love for my mother awoke in my young heart, and I thought of the maternal
bosom as my only place of refuge. It was but the day before this crisis
in my affairs, that I had providentially learned she was in Charleston,
under the guardianship of the priest by whom she was married to my
father. There I determined to seek her, and share her lot for good or for
evil; and escaping, without suspicion, from those who might be disposed
to detain me, I followed the same tedious and difficult road my poor
mother had trodden years before, and reached Charleston.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had no difficulty in finding a person so conspicuous as the
worthy priest, and was by him quickly conducted to the arms of my parent.
Here an entirely new scene of existence opened upon me, and overwhelmed
me with surprise and pleasure. I beheld things more wonderful and
delightful than it had ever entered into my imagination to conceive. No
pains were spared to effect my rapid improvement in mind, body, and soul.
I was carefully instructed in the holy mysteries of the Catholic faith,
and baptized&mdash;Maria, (after my mother.) I was soon thought fit to
mingle in the very superior society of which my mother formed a part, and
curiosity (for I can attribute it to nothing higher) rendered me rather
<i>recherch&eacute;.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a calm gravity in the manner of my mother, but she
was quite cheerful, and enjoyed, apparently, a share of happiness. Her
circumstances were easy, having been rendered so by the disinterested
kindness of the priest, who, by relating her singular and interesting
story, obtained for her large contributions from the liberal and
benevolent, among whom were persons distantly related to her exterminated
family. From being an object of compassion, she became one of esteem and
admiration as her acquaintance extended, and several advantageous offers
were not wanting to her for marriage. But although she did not assign
that as the reason for her refusal, she still considered herself as the
wife of Attacallaculla, and nothing could have tempted her during his
life into another alliance, although now that I, the only circumstance
which had ever called her heart back to the Indian country, had found my
way to her, she considered her intercourse with it forever at an end.
That indeed was my belief concerning myself, and although we occasionally
adverted to persons and things familiar to us in my native land, it was
as we would allude to those in a far away country to which it were
madness to think of vision extending, or the faintest sound coming from
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For myself I had never until then known any thing of happiness,
when my delighted spirit was bathing in its deepest sea. Desires were
formed only to be gratified, and the world was to me not less beautiful
than when, fresh from the hand of its Creator, it spread out in glory
before the first of the human race. I flew, like the wanton butterfly,
from one to another of the flowers by which I was surrounded, and rifled
their sweets. But the pleasures I tasted were those of innocence only,
and I knew neither surfeit nor weariness. My spirit was as pure as the
blue air above me, and scarcely less elastic. The mere sense of existence
was a source of more exquisite delight than the wicked have in their
wildest dissipations, for it was mingled with gratitude to the Being who
gave it. I rejoiced in the creatures of God as sharers with myself in his
paternal love. I advanced rapidly to the very acme of human bliss, only
to realize its transitory nature, and witness its departure like a dream
of the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The visiters at my mother's house were principally families of
a common origin with herself, that is, French, and among them was a young
man called Israel De Lisle.&mdash;I have said there was once a manly brow
as pale as thine, around which clustered the brown locks of
Europe&mdash;they are yet fresh in the memory of Yenacona.&mdash;But the
worm has fed sweetly on that brow&mdash;and the grave has swallowed up
the heart of Yenacona.&mdash;Did I speak of Israel De Lisle?&mdash;Pardon
me&mdash;it was a dream&mdash;it was a vision which my bewildered fancy
is forever chasing through the fields of air, but can never overtake
it.&mdash;A gay young Frenchman&mdash;no! he was not gay&mdash;there was
sadness in his countenance&mdash;and, oh! was there not pathos in his
voice when he spoke of love to Yenacona? But it is past! Tell me, Mr.
Aymor, do men love like women?&mdash;I cannot tell. Israel De Lisle told
me that he loved&mdash;and the heart of Yenacona&mdash;I know not if
Yenacona has a heart.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>Gideon again discovered a fire, like that of madness, kindling in her
eye, and whether or not his looks evinced his thoughts, she stopped and
collected herself.&mdash; &ldquo;Mr. Aymor,&rdquo; she continued, after a
pause, &ldquo;you think that my mind is wandering&mdash;and you are
right&mdash;but He whose spirit moved upon that deep where darkness had
brooded from everlasting, and said, 'Let there be light, and there was
light,' can quiet in a moment the most troubled
spirit.&mdash;There,&rdquo; said she, kissing her crucifix, &ldquo;it is
done;&rdquo; and then proceeded with composure:&mdash;&ldquo;Israel De
Lisle and Yenacona were married, and in the splendid cathedral, whose
pealing organ made its heavy arches ring with the sounds of solemn mirth,
the descendant of barbarian Kings was united by a holy sacrament with one
in whose veins, in all probability, ran the blood of some ancient
sovereign of the most polished nation upon earth.&mdash;He was all that
my heart could wish, and my cup of happiness, before nearly full, was now
overflowing. He was not only young, handsome, and amiable, but wealthy
and talented also; and although a Frenchman by family, was himself a
native of Charleston, and attached to the existing Government of the
country of his birth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Disaffection to the parent country, as it was called, was,
however, widely prevailing in the British American Colonies, and
resistance to some of the measures of the Government had already taken
place. South Carolina was a partaker with other States in this feeling of
insubordination, and Lord William Campbell, the then Colonial Governor,
was desirous to defeat by any means in his power the plans of the
opponents of Government. To give them full employment then, in defending
themselves against a dangerous enemy in their own neighborhood, he
resorted to stirring up the bordering Indian tribes, among whom suitable
agents were sent for the purpose. The talents and ambition of De Lisle,
connected with his known attachment to the existing Government, together
with his alliance by marriage with the Cherokee tribe, pointed him out as
one who might be advantageously employed in that quarter. His acceptance
of the trust was a fatal shock to the new found happiness of Yenacona and
her mother But De Lisle had hastily given his promise to Lord William
Campbell, and in those mistaken notions of honor, natural to youth, could
not think of retracting, whatever difficulties or improprieties might lie
in the way of the fulfilment of his undertaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We took leave of my afflicted mother, and set out with our
infant, but a few months old, for the Indian country. We arrived at this
place, where De Lisle opened a small store for the professed purpose of
trading with the Indians, and erected our house with the avowed intention
of making a permanent residence.&mdash;The grand-daughter of the recently
dead Moytoy was received with enthusiasm among his devoted people, and
her husband came at once into their esteem and confidence. My uncle
Toleniska was rejoiced to see me once more, forgiving all that was past,
while our little George, called by him and the rest of the Indians,
Oocomoo, became the darling of his heart. My father received us coldly,
and never deigned to make any inquiry after my mother. The proud and
passionate Soquilla did not condescend to speak to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;De Lisle was but too successful in his embassy, and for many
months the white inhabitants of the States of North and South Carolina,
and Georgia, bordering on the Cherokee country, were harassed with the
most frequent and distressing visitations of savage warfare, until, stung
to madness, they determined to destroy at once the whole tribe, as they
would have done a hoard of venomous insects.</p>

<p>&ldquo;General Griffith Rutherford, of North Carolina, with Colonel
Williamson, of South Carolina, were engaged in the performance of the
deed; and, although not consummated to the full, terrible was the
chastisement inflicted upon the deluded Indians.&mdash;The Cherokee
nation gathered their warriors to make a stand for their frontier, and,
consequently, most exposed villages. Amongst them was Etchoe, and, after
several skirmishes and battles, here a formidable and most decisive
struggle took place between the whites and the red men. De Lisle could
not desert those whom he had lead into danger, and accordingly aided
their operations, not only by his counsel, but his bravery, and
accompanied them wherever his services could be most advantageous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had already sacrificed too much to my affection for De Lisle,
to allow him to leave me behind, while engaged in this enterprise, and
perhaps moved by a sort of instinct of the race from which I was in part
descended, I took my infant and bore him as I followed the footsteps of
his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were in Etchoe when the place was assailed.&mdash;Men, Mr.
Aymor, may love the sounds of battle, and delight to bathe their
footsteps in blood&mdash;but there is nothing in woman to sustain her
courage amid the terrifying clamor of war&mdash;or to relieve the
sickening horror with which she beholds the mangled remains of hundreds
of her species.&mdash;What think you then must have been my situation
amid the deafening din of that awful hour&mdash;while my husband&mdash;my
father&mdash;and my uncle, were among those engaged in mortal
strife&mdash;where neither the helplessness of my sex, nor the infancy of
my child, were any security against violence from men of blood, roused by
repeated outrage into frantic fury? I will not attempt to paint the
horrors of my condition, to which no language could do justice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At length intelligence was brought me that De Lisle was taken
prisoner. I had been made perfectly acquainted by himself with the
perilous condition in which he would stand, should the event occur, of
which I was just informed; and it was principally for this reason I had
insisted on following him, hoping that I might under Providence, be the
means of saving him from so dreadful a fate. He could expect nothing
less, (he had told me) than that his life would be speedily and
ignominiously ended by his enraged countrymen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Entirely forgetful for the moment of my child, and filled with
the wildest alarm for the condition of my husband, I flew in the
direction where I thought there was most prospect of finding him, with
the gloomy hope that if I could not save I might at least comfort him by
my presence. By making hurried inquiries of all I met, whether friend or
foe, I arrived at length where a group of white persons were assembled,
busily engaged, and although they were armed, Mr. Aymor, it was no
soldiery employment that occupied them.&mdash;I cast my eye
upwards&mdash;and a rope was dangling from the limb of a tree&mdash;and I
saw that it had been newly cut with a knife.&mdash;It was enough&mdash;I
read from thence a tale of horror, and sunk senseless upon the body of my
husband.&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Aymor, do you now wonder that this brain is
fevered?&mdash;Are you not rather surprised that the wretched wife of
Israel De Lisle was ever separated alive from his murdered
corpse?&mdash;But He who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb, enables the
frailest of his creatures to bear all that may be necessary for the
fulfilment of his own inscrutable purposes; and I have escaped with life
from what might have crushed thousands of stouter hearts, to endure a
complication of calamities; and for thirty years that sickening
fluctuation of hope and despair, which wears away the sufferer, like a
moth fretting a garment.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>She paused, closed her eyes, and lifting them towards
Heaven&mdash;remained for a few moments uttering something in whispered
accents, which was probably not intended for the ear of Gideon; then
kissing her crucifix most devoutly&mdash;proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not how long I may have remained in a state of
insensibility, but when I recovered I was among strangers, whom I knew to
be some of Rutherford's army. My hair, as they told me, had changed
during my mental absence, (which lasted two or three days,) from its
native blackness to the snowy color in which you behold it, (releasing as
she spoke one of her tresses from its confinement.) I inquired after my
husband, and, in a compassionate manner, which checked a hatred of my
species, at that time growing up in my heart, a soldier informed me, with
tears in his eyes, that 'I need not be so cast down, for they had not
left the brave fellow a prey to the birds and the beasts, but had buried
him as became a soldier fighting in a better cause.' I beg ged to be
directed to the melancholy spot. 'I fear, poor woman,' said he, 'that you
will never find it, but if Bob Aymor was a freeman instead of a sergeant
in Captain Lenoir's company, he would lead you to it as straight as an
arrow; but although I can never bear the tears of a woman, I can hardly
venture the risk of being shot as a deserter for the sake of
them.&mdash;Besides, should I encounter a party of your friends they
would scarcely spare me for being engaged in an act of kindness to
you.&mdash;But I will give you the best directions in my power, and God
grant that you may succeed, for I know it will be a satisfaction to your
poor heart, even to look once more upon the spot where he
lies.&mdash;Come, cheer up, and take a sup from my canteen; it will
quicken your comprehension, and you will be the better able to understand
my directions, and, besides, something stronger to follow them.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;I accepted the courtesy of the kind soldier, partly because I
felt conscious that I would be benefited by something of a cordial
nature, and partly because I saw that by so doing I should gratify the
benevolent feelings of the generous man, who took so unaffected an
interest in my afflictions. He then, with a great deal of pains,
endeavored to make me understand the direction I should take in my search
for my husband's grave; and after having been, as I supposed, instructed
beyond the possibility of mistake, I set out, without any effort being
made to detain me. I had gone some distance, when, looking back, I saw
the tall soldier leaning upon the muzzle of his musket, while his left
cheek reclined upon his hand, in the very spot where I had left him,
pensively contemplating me as I departed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This explains to you, Mr. Aymor, in part, the interest I have
taken in all that concerns you since I learned your name, and have found
in you the son of the kind soldier; and although you cannot be said to be
like him, there is something in the expression of your countenance that
awakens the recollection of him in a heart where his memory is so
indelibly engraven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But to return to my gloomy narrative&mdash;my search was
fruitless for the grave of my husband&mdash;often did I say in my heart,
with Mary Magdalen at the sepulchre of our Lord&mdash;'Tell me where thou
hast laid him, and I will take him away.' But there was no voice to
answer me in the depth of the solitudes where I sought him. It is,
perhaps, well that I found him not. The cause in which he died did not
prosper, and Fame only decks with her trophies the brow of the living and
the tomb of the dead, when success points her to the object. But Infamy
has lifted the name of De Lisle to no bad eminence.&mdash;Forgotten, like
the spot of his burial, by all save one in whose heart his memory is yet
freshly preserved in the balm of connubial affection, he sleeps in a
quiet upon which even the officiousness of love may not intrude, until
that great day when the same voice which spake the earth into existence,
shall call upon her to yield up her dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grief of the speaker seemed for a moment to have lost its agony;
and, with a melancholy smile, she wiped away the tears that had gathered
in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first act in my tragic life is ended, Mr. Aymor;&rdquo; she
said&mdash;&ldquo;allow me to suspend a moment the narration of the
melancholy events which have made me what you see.&rdquo; She poured a
few drops of hartshorn into a tumbler, and adding to it a little water,
drank it off as a needful cordial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I had become weary and desperate,&rdquo; she proceeded,
&ldquo;in my search for the grave of his father, the child of Israel De
Lisle rushed upon my thoughts for the first time since I had left him at
Etchoe, and I turned with a mother's apprehensions from the husband, whom
I knew to be dead, to the child, whom I trusted was still living.
Exhausted as I was, I made what haste I could towards Etchoe, and soon
discovered, what had before escaped my observation&mdash;a huge volume of
smoke rolling up towards Heaven.&mdash;'It is the smoking remnants of the
wigwams of the people of Etchoe,' I said to myself&mdash;'which, some
hours since, have been given to the flames by the vengeance of the white
people;'&mdash;for although there was still a large quantity of smoke, it
was evidently of that kind which rises when the process of combustion is
nearly completed, and not such as is sent up from fiercely raging flames.
My next apprehension was that my poor infant, who had been left by its
mother amid a multitude of dangers, had perished in its helplessness, and
that the consuming element had snatched from me even the sad consolation
of beholding his remains. With a highly excited imagination I hastened
forward to witness a scene of awful devastation, and my heart almost died
within me when I beheld it. But the purpose upon which I was so anxiously
bent, of finding some clue to the fate of my lost child, sustained
me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The village of Etchoe was, as I had anticipated, scattered
piles of smoking ruins, and around and within it lay mingled the bodies
of white men and Indians, in all the various attitudes in which death had
taken or placed them. Among these horror-striking objects my search
necessarily lead me. Some of the bodies I found yet warm with recent
life, while others were stark and cold; in not one of them was there any
lingering of vitality, but along a stream of water flowing near the
village a row of poor wretches, with their faces to the ground, and some
of them, lying even in the stream itself, indicated with painful
certainty that they had dragged themselves, with their expiring strength,
to the cool gurgling brook, with the vain hope of slaking that burning
thirst by which the death wounded are said to be tortured. Within the
village the half-roasted bodies sent forth a smell so nearly resembling
that with which my nostrils had been so often regaled from the smoking
board, that I almost fainted with sickening disgust.&mdash; But I pursued
my search until I came to a warrior, whose forehead, cleft by a tomahawk,
showed through its yawning chasm the soft white brain.&mdash;My eye
rested for a moment on his features, and nature made her appeal to my
heart.&mdash;It was Attacallaculla&mdash;it was my father.&mdash;I sunk
down beside him, and the scenes of other years came freshly before
me.&mdash;I melted into tenderness, and kissed, in the bitterness of
affectionate grief, the icy lips of my stern parent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While I was pouring out my filial sorrows over the body of
Attacallaculla, a party of Cherokees had returned to the village, seizing
the first favorable occasion to recover and dispose of their dead. I was
startled by their whoop, which was immediately followed by the loud
flapping of the wings of myriads of vultures, as they arose, affrighted
from their loathsome repast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One common receptacle was prepared for all the fragments of
mortality scattered around us, save the scalps of the white men, which
were borne away as trophies; and, yielding to a necessity I could not
resist, I took a final embrace of the remains of my Indian parent, and
beheld them deposited, to mingle with the dust both of those who had been
his friends and those who had been his enemies in life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This party of Cherokees was commanded by Eonah, who kindly took
me under his protection, and, after diligent inquiries for my lost child,
as fruitless as had been the search for the grave of my husband, I
returned to the banks of the Tennessee River. Your father I found was a
prisoner to Eonah's party, and I vainly entreated for his liberty.
Finding that I had nothing to hope from interference in his behalf, I
left him to his fate, and proceeded to my cheerless home, widowed and
childless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had not formed plans for my future life, when a messenger
brought me word that my poor mother, having heard of the tragic events I
have just described, sickened, and in a few hours expired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only voice whose call might have attracted me from these
scenes of painful interest, being now hushed forever, nothing remained to
me but to linger about this spot, hallowed by the last months of the life
of my lamented husband, and where I should be most likely to recover, or
at least to gather tidings of the fate of my lost child. Here, years have
passed away, and I have been constantly agitated between hope and
despair;&mdash;sometimes hearing that my infant had cruelly perished, and
again that he is alive and prosperous. On the evening of your arrival, I
believed him recently slain by Eoneguski, and the last messenger, whose
coming has so affected me, brings word that he is yet alive, but no one
knows where.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He <i>is</i> alive,&rdquo; said Gideon, abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven bless you!&rdquo; said Yenacona, eagerly springing up,
and seizing upon Gideon&mdash;&ldquo;Have you seen him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seen him,&rdquo; replied Gideon, &ldquo;I have known him from
my infancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&mdash;Merciful Heaven tell me where?&rdquo; cried
Yenacona, almost frantic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is more than I am able to do.&mdash;I am myself partly in
search of him,&rdquo; said Gideon, as Yenacona threw herself in her seat
with an air of disappointment.</p>

<p>He then proceeded to relate all he knew of the person whom he supposed
to be her son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is he!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;it can be no other, for
your story corresponds with what was told me by the cruel
Soquilla.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She now urged Gideon, by the most powerful appeals to his humanity,
his professions of regard for her, and his love to the Little Deer, to
return to the Homony as soon as he had discharged his obligation to
Eoneguski, by being present at the funeral of Eonah, and make diligent
search for Oocomoo, and apprise him where he might find a mother,
anxiously longing to embrace him.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_13">CHAPTER X.</a></h3>

<p><br>
                          Her child was gone&mdash;her cry was
vain&mdash;<br>
                          And fev'rish madness fir'd her brain.</p>

<p align="right">YAMOYDEN.</p>

<p>THE story of Yenacona awakened in the bosom of Gideon a new interest
in behalf of John Welch, whom he was now more willing than ever to see
the husband of his sister, descended as he believed him to be from the
blood of Europe combined with that of the royal stock of the Oewoehee.
Nor did it fail, together with the farther information he obtained, to
place the Little Deer upon more elevated ground than she had hitherto
occupied in his estimation. It threw around her romantic associations, to
which the heart of no lover is indifferent, and her relationship to Welch
gave her a claim to respect somewhat upon the score of family
connexion.</p>

<p>The same day of his interview with Yenacona, Gideon, having renewed
his application for her assistance, and taken leave of her and the Little
Deer, departed for Eonee. While he is engaged in this journey, we will
take occasion more fully to complete the story of Yenacona, and relate
some other matters which ought properly to precede the funeral of
Eonah.</p>

<p>After the battle of Etchoe, Yenacona, so far as she knew, was without
a relation in the world, except Ooconoota, a son of her father by his
last wife, and she spent her time in brooding over her afflictions, or in
acts of penance or charity, according to the faith she professed, until
she became quite fanatical, and occasionally her mind was wild and
fanciful, if not actually deranged. Slight circumstances were now and
then communicated to her, that induced a faint hope that her child might
yet be alive, and again the spark thus kindled would be more hopelessly
than ever extinguished.</p>

<p>At length a celebrated Saga was settled at Sugar Town, coming from a
far country, having power to bring to light the most secret things, and
she was urged by many to apply to him for intelligence of her
son.&mdash;Her Christian principles opposed any application to a
soothsayer, as such, but she naturally conjectured that the supposed Saga
had supplied himself with extensive means of intelligence, that might,
perchance, reach to the fact of which she was in search, and, yielding to
persuasions of which she was almost daily the subject, she determined to
repair to the wigwam of the Prophet.</p>

<p>Her ancient admirer, Soquilla, had been gloomy, discontented, and
misanthropic, from the time that Yenacona had fled to avoid him, and so
frequently acted with cruelty and violence to those who happened to fall
into his power, that he had become obnoxious to the hatred of almost
every individual of his tribe. He was among the missing at the battle of
Etchoe, and was supposed to have fallen with the multitudes of the slain
in that sanguinary contest, and no loss sustained by the nation was so
little regretted, if it was not to many a subject of rejoicing. But
Yenacona was not one of those who rejoiced; she had been harassed, it was
true, by his unwelcome addresses, and subjected to great inconvenience to
avoid them, but that inconvenience had led her to the only brief scenes
of happiness she had enjoyed in this fluctuating life; and now that
Soquilla was no more, she remembered him as one who had loved her well,
if not wisely, and assigned him a place among the many whose fate she
deplored.</p>

<p>But thoughts of every thing but her lost child were banished from her
mind, when she visited the Saga, with the faint hope of learning
something consolatory respecting him. She was alone, and, walking up to
the closed door of his wigwam, gave a timid irresolute knock. For some
time she waited in anxious expectation before the door was opened,
although her knock was repeated more than once. At length she was
admitted, and trembled with agitation as she found herself alone, with
one, of whom she had heard such wonderful things, though she had not
heretofore credited the half. His face and person were so enveloped as to
defy scrutiny, while, through a mask he wore, he could uninterruptedly
speculate on the looks and actions of the person before him.</p>

<p>She was speechless, and almost ready to sink, when, to add to her
painful impressions, the Saga, in a strange unearthly voice, addressed
her in a sort of wild blank verse, which, as heretofore, we have
endeavored to paraphrase in rhyme.</p>

<p><br>
                          Gentle mortal, speak thy thought<br>
                          To the list'ning Saga's ear;<br>
                          If Fate's mysteries are sought,<br>
                          Wisely hast thou ventur'd here.</p>

<p><br>
                          Stay! thou needs't not speak thy thought,<br>
                          Visions crowd upon my view&mdash;<br>
                          A long lost infant here is sought&mdash;<br>
                          A mother's tears thy cheeks bedew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; cried Yenacona, in outraged piety.&mdash;&ldquo;I
am a worshipper of the true God, and am not to be cheated with the
jugglery which affects to pry into his inscrutable mysteries, otherwise
than under the guidance of his own Holy Spirit. I doubt not you are wise,
and I perceive that I am not unknown to you. I came not for information,
as relying on the heathenish inspiration of which you boast, but taking
it for granted that, for the purpose of sustaining the reputation of your
art, you have provided yourself with extensive sources of information, I
trusted it might be in your power, through natural means, to tell me what
of every thing earthly it most concerns me to know. I am, indeed, a
wretched mother, anxiously in search of her long lost offspring. Tell me,
then, I implore you, if your knowledge extends so far&mdash;is my child
yet alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yenacona,&rdquo; said a voice entirely different from that
which had before spoken, the well remembered tones of which thrilled
through her whole frame, &ldquo;hast thou ever tasted the sweetness of
revenge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;revenge&rdquo; sounded in her ears as if it came from
the lips of a demon, and filled her soul with chilling apprehensions; but
conscious that the crisis called for all her self-possession, she
summoned it to her aid, and, in her own peculiarly sweet tone of voice,
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;the soul of Yenacona has never
panted with that thirst, which is the torment of the wicked. It was in
mercy to themselves, as he always speaks, that the Everlasting Father
hath said to his children, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay.' &ldquo;</p>

<p>Ha! ha! ha! rang a wild demoniac laugh through the wigwam of the Saga,
and he cried, tauntingly, &ldquo;Where are the beautiful black locks of
Yenacona?&mdash;and methinks the scalding tear-drop has worn unseemly
furrows in her soft smooth cheek since she despised the love of
Soquilla.&mdash;Tell me, thou beautiful worshipper of the true God, what
thou wouldst give to embrace the lovely boy, for whom thou hast so long
gone sorrowing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that I can command,&rdquo; she said, calmly; &ldquo;and if
the wide earth were hers, what mother would refuse to exchange it for her
only son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; replied the person who addressed her, in ironical
imitation of her own composed manner, &ldquo;suppose you should learn
that the flames had devoured the infant, into which he was cast, to
writhe like a young serpent, by one who hated him for the sake of his
mother; and suppose the wretch (you would call him) who had stood by
rejoicing while the blood of his young heart hissed upon the glowing
embers, and his roasting limbs sent to his nostrils their savory steams,
were given up to be dealt with according to your pleasure, would not your
soul rejoice in the feast of vengeance, as you prepared for him
unutterable tortures?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sick and horror-stricken at the diabolical images you have
presented to my mind,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but such a monster as you
have imagined, lives not to breathe the pure air of Heaven. Yet, if
perchance there should be one who had so injured Yenacona, she would bow
herself in humility before her Creator, and say&mdash;Father forgive him
for he knew not what he did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause, and at length the voice resumed&mdash;&ldquo;Thou
speakest as a woman, Yenacona, and knowest nothing of the noble passions
which stir the soul of a warrior.&mdash;Thou dreamest not of that joy
which moves wild laughter in the throat of Soquilla, when he looks upon
the faded beauty which once drove him to madness.&mdash;When he thinks
upon the dishonorable grave of Israel De Lisle&mdash;upon the raging
flames which wrapped the pale body of the young Oocomoo&rdquo;&mdash;and
again the wretch laughed out wildly in joy and derision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monster!&rdquo; cried Yenacona, in agony&mdash;&ldquo;Is it
true you thus murdered my child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He arose, and grasped her firmly by the arm, and leading her to the
door of the wigwam, pointed to the blue sky above them.&mdash;&ldquo;Does
Yenacona,&rdquo; he said, solemnly, &ldquo;believe that the God of the
Christians has his dwelling place far above us, beyond that beautiful
arch, where no eye can reach him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; replied the unhappy woman, &ldquo;that the
God of the Christians dwelleth in light to which no human eye can
approach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is not less certain,&rdquo; said he, with bitterness,
&ldquo;that the hand of Soquilla committed to the flames the offspring of
De Lisle and the false Yenacona.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No longer able to doubt the truth of the horrid story, the shock of
conviction subdued, as by a thunderstroke, both the mental and physical
powers of Yenacona, and she sunk down beside the door way of the Saga,
apparently lifeless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Revenge is sweet,&rdquo; he said, as he bent over
her.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, it is true Soquilla did commit the boy to the
flames, but a meddlesome pale face rescued him&mdash;and he yet lives.
But he lives not for Yenacona, while she is ignorant of his
life&mdash;Hah! she breathes not&mdash;she must revive&mdash;or the feast
of Soquilla's revenge will be ended?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He administered to her some one of the numerous potions with which he
was in the habit of healing human maladies, and in a short time she
revived, but it was with an almost obliterated intellect. She was
conveyed home, and by slow degrees regained very nearly, if not
altogether, her original mind. Time rolled on, and Ooconoota, the brother
of Yenacona, had become a father. He died, and left his only daughter in
the care of her mother. Time still rolled on, and the girl had grown to
budding womanhood. She had seen Eoneguski, the favorite young brave of
the Oewoehee, and won his heart. Her lover visited her frequently at her
mother's wigwam, and she was soon to become his wife. But death's shafts
fly thickly, and one of them smote the mother of the Little Deer.</p>

<p>The benevolent Yenacona beheld her young niece an orphan, and felt
gushing up from the depths of its source the stream of maternal
affection, and flowing copiously towards the Little Deer. Shyly at first
the Indian maiden partook of its refreshing waters, until gradually
becoming emboldened, she threw herself unreservedly into the stream. She
was taken to the house of her aunt, who availed herself of every
opportunity of operating upon her religious opinions, and bringing her
insensibly to abandon the superstitions in which she had been brought up,
and to embrace the truths of Christianity. Eoneguski continued to visit
the Little Deer after her removal to the dwelling of her aunt, and was
kindly received by the latter, who had not forgotten the &ldquo;auld lang
syne&rdquo; kindnesses of Eonah.&mdash;But in her heart she deprecated
that her niece, to whom her attachment was daily growing more ardent,
should become the wife of a heathen. She remembered the trials of her
mother, but to look more repugnantly upon one whom she confidently hoped
to make a Christian, uniting herself in marriage with a superstitious
savage.</p>

<p>She had made some progress in christianizing the mind of the Little
Deer, when an unusually long absence of Eoneguski afforded her an
opportunity of suggesting, with much effect, her objections to an union
with him. We have seen that the mind of the Little Deer was embued with a
true delicacy, (for Yenacona had always given some attention to her
training, even while she resided in the house of her mother,) which
revolted at the idea intimated by her aunt, that in marrying Eoneguski
she might be compelled to share her husband with another, and this
consideration so far operated as to induce her to think seriously of a
life of celibacy.</p>

<p>While Yenacona was so much interested in the Little Deer as to lose
for a time the more acute remembrance of her own weighty griefs, and to
assume even the appearance of cheerfulness, Soquilla, who, although he
had no opportunities of seeing her, heard frequently of her state, of
which he diligently inquired on every occasion, rejoiced in the
intelligence that she was a prey to sorrow. As soon, therefore, as he
heard of her becoming composed and cheerful, with fiendish malignity, he
resolved to stir her grief afresh, and rightly judging that what he knew
to be true, would be more effectual than the most ingenious fabrication,
sent her word by a confidential agent that her child had wonderfully
escaped the flames, and was now a handsome young warrior. That he had
recently been in the Indian country, where he had slain one of the people
of Eonee, and, being compelled to fly, was pursued by Eoneguski, whose
known skill and bravery ensured the destruction of the object of his
pursuit.&mdash;Misery again was the lot of Yenacona, and she was left to
conclude that fate, which had been so long tantalizing her with ever
disappointed hopes, must have at length completed its work. She mingled
her sorrows with those of the Little Deer, who was shocked to believe
that the son of her aunt had fallen by the hands of Eoneguski. But they
were both aware of the imperativeness of the custom upon which the young
Indian acted, and his ignorance of their relationship to his victim; and
they could not therefore in reason attach to him any real censure. It was
under these circumstances that they were so much excited when they next
saw him, while their violent conflict of feeling, prevented, during his
brief stay, any explanation.</p>

<p><br>
                          There is no pow'r within my soul,<br>

                          Sunken and cold; but it may rise<br>

                          And death will come, like the last play<br>
                          Of lightning in a stormy sea.</p>

<p align="right">YAMOYDEN.</p>

<p>TRAGEDY is confessedly, when well executed, the highest effort of
genius; and the polished mind is distinguished from the vulgar by its
preference for scenes that stir the deeper passions, over those which
excite only laughter and the sense of the ridiculous. The tone of mind in
which a fellow creature approaches nature's last trial, is an infallible
subject of interested observation. The fear of death is the common
weakness of our race, and none are more ashamed of it than those who are
most conscious of its existence. The coward is equally interested with
the brave man in the character of his species, and feels not less proud
than he at beholding another vindicating its honor by a triumph over the
tyrant who fills his own bosom with the most servile apprehensions, and
is no less ready with his offering of grateful admiration. On the other
hand, he is no less indignant at any exhibition of unmanly weakness in
encountering the foe from whom there is no retreat, although he may be
conscious at the same time that his own conduct would be more
pusillanimous.</p>

<p>In addition to these causes of exciting interest in the contemplation
of a scene of death, there is a consciousness, scarcely perceived, that
the mind thus occupied is engaged in a most useful exercise. Man
instinctively feels that the day with him for which all other days were
made, is the day of death, and that he is destined at last to enter the
arena with that champion before whom the heroes of all ages have fallen.
Like Julius C&aelig;sar, every man would like to die with decency, and
there is an elevation produced, which enables one to copy while he
admires the noble bearing of a brave spirit in its conflict with death;
while the ridiculous and graceless carriage of cowardice excites
contempt, and repels from imitation. These are probably some, if not all
the secrets of tragic pleasure, and of the elevated rank of tragic
composition.</p>

<p>To two scenes of death we are invited in this chapter, with such moral
improvements as each reader may for himself deduce from them.</p>

<p>The wounded Saga, whom we left at Sugar Town, was, as we have seen,
the same person with Soquilla, the early admirer of Yenacona&mdash;and
according to his own admission, had been led by a spirit of revenge to a
most fiendish act. After this he disappeared from amongst the Cherokees,
and, travelling through distant tribes, collected information to fit him
for the part he subsequently acted. He returned to his own country in
disguise, and under the assumed name of Susquanannacunahata, or the Long
Blanket. He was really an old man, but violent passions had done more
than time to give him the appearance of extreme antiquity.</p>

<p>An accomplice was necessary for his success in the character of a
prophet, and he determined to confide in his old friend Eonah, to whom he
could render himself useful when his influence should be established as a
prophet and physician. He was not disappointed; for Eonah, a good deal
embarrassed from time to time by the ambitious plans of Chuheluh, and
with his seditious practices, was very willing to avail himself of such a
means of influence over the public mind as the scheme of Soquilla
afforded. Eonah was accordingly the first to offer to the foreign Saga,
who had deigned to settle amongst the Cherokees, marks of respect and
confidence in his sacred character&mdash;and we have already seen with
how much fidelity he was repaid.</p>

<p>For some days after the Saga was wounded, as we have described, he was
nearly insensible, and it was plain he could not long survive. The day
was one of those which Spring sometimes borrows from Summer, like a jewel
in an Ethiop's ear, ten-fold more beautiful from contrast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raise the casement,&rdquo; said the Saga, in a faint voice, to
Wissa, who, with the power of speech seemed to have recovered that of
hearing also&mdash;&ldquo;and let the fresh air breathe upon the fevered
cheek of the dying.&mdash;This is the day,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;on
which the Oewoehee celebrate the Bath of Herbs.&mdash;It will be the last
day of the life of Susquanannacunahata.&mdash;This day four hundred and
thirty moons ago, Soquilla beheld Yenacona for the first time, at the
Bath of Herbs.&mdash;The day of the Bath of Herbs has been an evil day to
Susquanannacunahata.&mdash;When there is no more breath in the body of
Susquanannacunahata,&rdquo; he said, addressing Wissa&mdash;&ldquo;fly to
Tesumtoe, and whisper in the ear of Yenacona, that Soquilla is no
more&mdash;tell her that Oocomoo is yet alive, and that the hands of
Eoneguski are unstained with his blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then fell into a state of insensibility, in which he remained for
some hours. Towards evening the roar of an approaching storm was heard
from a distance&mdash;it drew nearer&mdash;and at length came onward with
fearful fury and rapidity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the voice of the Death Angel!&rdquo; said the Saga,
starting in alarm&mdash;&ldquo;and my spirit must take its flight upon
his dark broad wing.&mdash;Dark! did I say?&mdash;There will be a
dazzling brightness in the wing of the angel, when mounted by
Susquanannacunahata&mdash;and there shall be glorious splendor in the
departure of the Saga.&mdash;Hark!&mdash;do you not hear the rumbling of
the wheels of his chariot, as it approaches?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wind now roared fiercely through the mountain
hollows&mdash;&ldquo;Depart from me,&rdquo; said the
Saga&mdash;&ldquo;for no eye must look upon the death struggle of the
great Prophet and Medicine.&rdquo; Wissa knew not how to act.
&ldquo;Depart, I say;&rdquo;&mdash;repeated the Saga.</p>

<p>Wissa left the hut, but had not progressed far in the open air, when,
in an instant, he felt a tumultuous rushing of the blood towards his
brain, as if seeking for itself an outlet from his ears, and before his
mind could answer itself the hasty question&mdash;&ldquo;What does this
mean?&rdquo;&mdash;it lost the consciousness of its own being. This was
probably the joint effect of intense light and a violent concussion of
the atmosphere, which deprived Wissa, for a time, of sense and motion.
But a torrent of rain descended upon him, and waked up his dormant
faculties to a scene filling him with amazement and horror.</p>

<p>The wigwam of the Saga was in bright conflagration, and, regardless of
the fast falling rain, in which the clouds seemed to be emptying
themselves in cataracts, the flames each moment gathered additional fury.
He approached the hut, but a dense sulphurous vapor, issuing from it,
mingled with liquid fire, drove him back in despair. He sought assistance
from the tenants of the neighboring huts, and they readily enough
encountered the storm; but when they reached the late sanctuary of the
Saga, it was only to look on in consternation, while the flames blazed
out in every direction, roaring in defiance of any who might desire to
subdue them, and leaping and quivering as if eager to seize on those who
should be rash enough to approach them. In a few minutes the wigwam of
the Saga of Sugar Town was an heap of ashes, and nothing could be
distinguished as the remains of its late aged inhabitant, unless it were
a portion of ashes about the place where the bed once was, whose chalky
whiteness indicated that they might be the residuum of human bones.</p>

<p>The storm now ceased, and the sun burst forth upon the scene, smiling
thereon as in approbation or mockery. Wissa looked on for a time in
melancholy silence, and then turned, with a sigh, to bear his master's
last message to her who had so unwillingly been the ruling spirit of his
destiny.</p>

<p>Eonah, who, when left by the Saga, had lingered on from hour to hour,
each, to all human appearance, his last, until the day whose evening
storm has so much affected many of the characters of our story, was them
just ready to take his flight to the world of spirits. Yet the storm
affected not him. It passed over him unmoved by its wind and unshaken by
its thunder. But when all was once more quiet, the resplendent rainbow
glowing in the East, threw its prismatic glories full before the eyes of
Eonah, and renewed for a time their faded vision. He gazed intently on
the lovely meteor, until the Heaven-wrought picture faded from the
cloud.</p>

<p>Eoneguski called softly the name of his father, but there was no voice
in answer&mdash;he looked upon his face, and all there was still. There
was no speculation beneath the motionless eyelids. He closed them with a
gentle hand&mdash;and the young chief stood alone by the corpse of his
father.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_15">CHAPTER XII.</a></h3>

<p><br>
                          Seek we thy once loved home?&mdash;<br>
                          The hand is gone that cropp'd its
flowers&mdash;<br>
                          Cold is the hearth within the bowers.<br>
                          And should we thither roam,<br>
                          Its echo and its empty tread<br>
                          Would sound like voices from the dead.</p>

<p align="right">CAMPBELL.</p>

<p>IN every age and country honor to the dead hath been ranked among the
works of piety, however wide may have been the differences in their modes
of showing it. The pyramids and obelisks of Egypt yet stand as wondrous
and stupendous monuments of their veneration for the departed, to say
nothing of the laborious and ingenious exertions by which they endeavored
to rescue the frail body itself from the grasp of corruption. The
scorched inhabitant of India testifies, in various ways, his fond
recollection of those who were dear to him in life, and sometimes even by
annihilating the distinction between them. Solemn and affecting were the
rites with which the ancient Hebrews committed their deceased brethren to
the earth, and said to the departing spirit, &ldquo;Go in peace.&rdquo;
In Greece and Rome, games and other expensive marks of respect
perpetuated, for ages, the memory of the dead. And among the wild
aborigines of our own land, simple expressions of regret are offered for
departed relations, while their graves are approached with the most
sacred awe, and time, in his flight, is not suffered to efface them.</p>

<p>Gideon arrived at Eonee at the expected time, without any thing
remarkable having befallen him on his journey. He was cordially received
by Eoneguski, whose countenance wore an expression of sadness, but there
were no extravagant indications of grief. Gideon felt a little conscience
smitten by the frank manner of the generous savage, whose confidence he
was abusing, but endeavored to bear himself as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>The body of Eonah, arrayed in the best apparel left by the old chief,
was decently laid out upon a sort of scaffold, formed of boards, in his
own wigwam, to which every one had free ingress, to look upon the remains
of their departed chief.</p>

<p>Early the next morning persons came pouring in from every direction,
to witness the obsequies of one so distinguished. Most unvarying
solemnity was in the manner of all, but there was no tumultuous
expression of grief from any, nor did a tear-drop glisten upon a single
cheek. Gideon remarked that, besides the clothes now actually worn by the
deceased chief, a large quantity of wearing apparel was laid on the
scaffold beside him, and, upon inquiry, he learned that it was the
remainder of his wardrobe. His pipe, tomahawk, and scalping-knife were
also there; and, as Eoneguski deposited a rifle, &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said
he, in a whisper to Gideon, &ldquo;was once the property of your father,
who left it with Eonah, in exchange for his own, when Aymor returned to
the white settlements.&rdquo; Gideon felt as if he were near an old
friend, as he looked upon the rifle which had once been his father's, and
was almost instinctively impelled to stretch forth his hand and grasp it.
But he was surrounded by a multitude of strangers, who might
misunderstand the act, and to whom it would be difficult to make
explanations, and so he restrained himself.</p>

<p>At length the hour arrived when the body was to be conveyed to its
last resting place. A half dozen of the most aged and respectable among
those present approached the scaffold with decent solemnity, arranged
themselves around it, and, raising it from that whereon it rested,
conveyed it, with all its contents, out of the wigwam. They then marched
slowly towards a slight eminence within view of the village, and, without
regard to order or arrangement, the crowd followed them. When the bearers
had reached the top of the eminence, thickly covered with oblong hillocks
of stone, they halted, and deposited their burden. A circle was then
formed round it, of which every one present constituted a portion. They
then passed round the corpse, in procession, each person causing the
earth to return at intervals a sharp distinct sound, as he smote it with
his foot, in unison with the rest of the company, the whole repeating, at
the same time, short sentences, in a measured tone, substantially as
follow:&mdash;</p>

<p><br>
                          Low lies the chieftain on the lone hill
top,<br>
                          Where all the mighty dead nightly assemble,<br>
                          Mingling their voices with the sad night
wind&mdash;<br>
                          In dismal cadence.</p>

<p><br>
                          Cold is his wan cheek&mdash;marble his pale
brow&mdash;<br>
                          Quench'd is his bright eye&mdash;fix'd are his
clos'd lips&mdash;<br>
                          No more the warm breath passing between
them&mdash;<br>
                          Comes from his bosom.</p>

<p><br>
                          Still as the broad leaf, when the air
ceases<br>
                          Stirring its greenness on the steep hill
side,<br>
                          When the mild summer reigns o'er all
nature&mdash;<br>
                          Our chieftain lies low.</p>

<p><br>
                          Call to him, ancient braves&mdash;he may not
answer;&mdash;<br>
                          Let the loud war-whoop ring through the
forests;&mdash;<br>
                          Dull on the warrior's ear still must its sound
fall,&mdash;<br>
                          Sleeping profoundly.</p>

<p><br>
                          Let woman's plaintive voice rise from the
valleys,<br>
                          Calling the chieftain to wake from his
slumber,<br>
                          Yet may he not come to join in the gay
dance<br>
                          With bounding footstep.</p>

<p><br>
                          Bound in his icy sleep here must we leave
him;<br>
                          Kitchi Manitou hath claimed his free
spirit,<br>
                          Borne it away to the land of the blessed,<br>
                          There to rest ever.</p>

<p><br>
                          The sun may not scorch him&mdash;the rain may
not wet him;&mdash;<br>
                          His body shall moulder unseen and in quiet,<br>
                          Many long moons beneath the huge stone pile<br>
                          Heap'd high above him.</p>

<p><br>
                          Son of the brave&mdash;advance&mdash;'tis thy
duty&mdash;<br>
                          Lay the first stone on the brow of thy
father,&mdash;<br>
                          Let no unmanly tear course down thy young
cheek,<br>
                          Staining its valor.</p>

<p><br>
                          Think of his brave deeds&mdash;think of his
glory,&mdash;<br>
                          Weep not for him whose warfare is
ended,&mdash;<br>
                          Through the Elysian fields henceforth he
wanders in<br>
                          Raptures unmingl'd.</p>

<p>All now stood still, and Eoneguski, looking upwards, smote his
forehead with his right hand, and then, bending himself, took up a massy
flat stone, and deposited it gently on the face of his father. This
seemed to be a signal&mdash;for instantly every one present was engaged
in hastily gathering up the loose fragments of rock scattered over the
hill, and heaping them upon the body of Eonah, until it, together with
all the apparel and arms lying beside it, were effectually covered by the
accumulated masses.</p>

<p>When this was accomplished, they hastened back to the late dwelling of
Eonah, with the same disregard to order that had characterized their
departure from it&mdash;all save Eoneguski, who lingered for some time,
apparently engaged in melancholy meditation beside the newly made grave
of his brave and venerated sire.</p>

<p>When the funeral party arrived at the late residence of Eonah, they
perceived a person approaching it with a firebrand, with the evident
design of setting it on fire. &ldquo;Why should the wigwam of Eonah be
given to the fire?&rdquo; inquired one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied he who bore the torch, &ldquo;he was a
bad man&mdash;he was a tyrant&mdash;he oppressed the people of Eonee, and
was a friend to the enemies of his nation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is false!&rdquo; said the first speaker, &ldquo;Eonah was a
good man;&mdash;his wigwam shall not be given to the flames.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hath not the Great Spirit himself devoured with flames the
wigwam of the Saga of Sugar Town, and was he not confederate with
Eonah?&rdquo; said the bearer of fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Spirit deals according to his pleasure,&rdquo;
replied the first speaker, &ldquo;but no mortal shall put fire to the
wigwam of Eonah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The remainder of the crowd having now ascertained the subject of
contest, united in the decision that Eonah was a good man, and that the
usual expression of the public disapprobation of one recently dead, by
setting fire to his wigwam, would be an act of gross injustice to his
memory. The incendiary, who was no other than Chuheluh himself, was
forced to yield, and reluctantly throw aside the brand, by which he had
intended to destroy the wigwam of Eonah, with the secret purpose that it
should injuriously affect the prospects of his son as his successor in
the chieftainship of Eonee.</p>

<p>The public opinion being thus formally expressed respecting the
character of the deceased, parties were despatched, some to bring in
game, and others, spirits, that funeral festivities might be kept,
suitable to his worth. Many of the parties were successful in both
objects, and cheer, that would have done credit to a funeral in Ireland,
was provided in abundance. For many days Eonee was a scene of noise and
drunken revelry, and, according to the custom of barbarian nations in
every age, the dead was lamented and honored, by the living betaking
themselves with more zeal and perseverance to unlimited indulgence in
animal pleasures. When the last piece of game had been devoured, and the
last drop of the fire-water, provided for the funeral of Eonah, had
ceased to affect the reason of him who swallowed it, the business of life
was resumed as usual, and the people repaired to hold a council relative
to his successor.</p>

<p align="right">GAY.</p>

<p>GOVERNMENT, even amongst the most civilized nations, has been
generally formed out of a concurrence of circumstances, adding a feature
now, and another then, until what was at first a rude chaos, assumes
something like order and regular beauty. In the process of formation, it
often undergoes entire changes in its prominent characteristics. Now it
is a monarchy&mdash;now an aristocracy, or perhaps a hierarchy&mdash;and
then a pure democracy.</p>

<p>The rude Government of the Cherokees differed very little in its
history from others, and mingled in some degree all these
characteristics. They have generally had a principal chief, who has
sometimes borne a title equivalent to King. The subordinate chiefs, who
were numerous, answered to an aristocracy.&mdash;The prophets swayed the
minds of the chiefs and people, with a power which, in effect, placed the
Government in their hands, while the people at large held all accountable
to them, and made and deposed them at pleasure. Generally speaking, the
offices of both the general and local chiefs were hereditary, but
whenever moved thereto by circumstances, deemed by them sufficient, the
people suspended the regular operation of the law, and committed the
princely power to other hands.</p>

<p>It was for the purpose of inquiring into the propriety of
acknowledging the hereditary right of Eoneguski as their local chief, or
of disallowing it, and appointing some one more acceptable, that the
people of Eonee assembled after the funeral rites of their late chieftain
were over. Much the larger portion would have been for acknowledging
Eoneguski with acclamation, had not his manhood been stained by the
termination of his expedition against John Welch, and but for some
reports unfavorable to the late chief, respecting the escape of Aymor,
during the war against the whites many moons before: all of which
Chuheluh had been active in propagating with a view to his own
success.</p>

<p>Eoneguski was not ignorant of the difficulties in his way, and with an
eloquence, the joint result of native talent and conscious integrity, he
told his unvarnished story to the conviction and admiration of the
assembled council. Chuheluh perceived at once the hopelessness of his
prospects, and one less ambitious and self-confident than he, would have
abandoned them. But after having been tantalized by them through the
greater part of his life, and led on from one act of baseness to another,
he could not make up his mind to a fate he nevertheless saw to be
inevitable, but resolved upon one last desperate effort. He replied to
Eoneguski, and spoke of him and his deceased father in terms of the
grossest opprobrium. He went on to allege a most nefarious combination
between the late Saga and Chieftain to impose the son of the latter upon
the people as their chief.</p>

<p>Whilst Chuheluh was pressing this subject with a good deal of warmth,
two persons entered the place where the council was holden;&mdash;the one
a respectable elder of the tribe, and the other the servant of the late
Saga, Wissa, staggering under the burden of two ox-hides carefully rolled
up. As soon as the eye of Chuheluh fell upon the ox-hides, he stammered,
turned pale, and looked as if seeking an opportunity for escape. But the
attempt would have been fruitless. The hides were now spread out before
the council, and many present recognised in them those which once covered
the oxen of the Saga.</p>

<p>Chuheluh was formally charged with being the cause of the death of the
Saga, by purposely setting fire to the mountain behind him, and of having
availed himself of the confusion to steal and kill his oxen.</p>

<p>The bare suspicion of such atrocities was sufficient to put him aside,
as the opponent of Eoneguski, who was hailed by acclamation as the
chieftain of Eonee, while his late competitor was compelled to stand
before the assembled council to answer the imputed crimes of murder and
theft. His guilt was fully established as to the theft, through the zeal
and sagacity of Wissa, who had traced the cattle to his possession. Wissa
had secretly taken persons of character along with him, and found both
the hides, and a good part of the flesh, salted away in the wigwam of
Chuheluh. This evidence against him being corroborated by other
circumstances remarkably strong, left no doubt of his guilt upon any mind
as to this part of the accusation. But his having set fire to the
mountain, and especially with any murderous purpose, was not so fully
established: so that whilst he was left upon the charge of homicide,
under strong suspicions, to be dealt with according to the unerring
judgment of Him from whom nothing is hid, the council pronounced him
guilty of the larceny, and sentenced him accordingly.</p>

<p>Stripes seem to have been a punishment pointed out by nature for all
offences of much magnitude, yet not sufficiently flagrant to merit death,
but the mode and severity in which they shall be inflicted, have greatly
differed, according to the age and country in which they have been
applied. Amongst the Cherokees they constitute the punishment for every
crime except homicide, and respecting that a custom prevails, it has been
one of the purposes of this story, in part, to illustrate. For all other
crimes, without regard to age or sex, stripes are the proper atonement.
Indeed, the softer sex, with a severity upon that subject, which seems to
have visited them in all times and places, receive them for an offence to
which public opinion attaches no blame to the males; but cruel are the
scourgings to which the unfortunate squaw is generally subjected who has
broken her allegiance to Diana. Happily, however, this seldom occurs, and
upon few subjects have their more fortunate neighbors, the whites,
greater reason to blush at the superior virtue of their Cherokee
neighbors.</p>

<p>But for whatever crime inflicted, whipping is, with the Cherokees, no
light punishment. It is, indeed, more properly beating than whipping; and
is, in fact, called poling. They have a set of officers denominated
light-horsemen, answering in their functions somewhat to our office of
sheriff, whose duty it is to arrest fugitives, and inflict these
formidable castigations upon those against whom they are denounced. This
is done with a long heavy pole, and the blows sometimes extend in number
to five or six hundred, dealt with all the force of the operator, who is
not (neither is he expected to be) at all solicitous for the
consequences. The number of blows is to be inflicted in the usual manner,
without regard to the life of the subject. If he dies it is in the
regular course of things, and no concern is felt about it by any one.
With passionless composure, the light-horseman accomplishes his task, and
no fire of anger or indignation flashes from his eye to inflame the
resentment of his victim&mdash;no look of compassion to alleviate his
sufferings.</p>

<p>There is perhaps no situation in which the fortitude and capacity for
endurance of an Indian is so obviously manifested as when undergoing
these sentences of their barbarian judicatures. No appeal is ever made
for reversal, suspension or mitigation of the sentence&mdash;not an
imploring look is cast upon the man of authority; but as if studiously
avoiding any accidental motions of sympathy in his favor, the culprit
throws into his countenance the most iron stoicism. When undergoing
punishment, the involuntary perspiration may bathe the limbs&mdash;the
lacerated vessels may pour forth their crimson tribute&mdash;exhausted
nature may faint or even fail&mdash;but not a sigh will heave the
bosom&mdash;not a tear moisten the eye&mdash;not a groan burst from the
laboring chest&mdash;not a breath of complaint separate the inflexible
lips&mdash;not one convulsive motion disturb the cold marble serenity of
the countenance.</p>

<p>It was thus that Chuheluh, under the sentence of the council, atoned
for his theft of the Saga's cattle, by the endurance of three hundred
stripes, neither lightly nor unskilfully laid on, with a long pole. But
while the light-horseman did nothing to disparage his professional skill,
Chuheluh failed not, on his part, to give to a scene so degrading, all
the moral grandeur it could borrow from his own immoveable stoicism, and,
like the young Spartan who had stolen a fox, his countenance was as
placid as the summer heaven, whilst his very vitals were in agony. But
his bodily sufferings were nothing to his mental anguish. From early
youth he had cherished ambitious hopes, and while striving, even during
the life of Eonah, to undermine and supplant him, had always flattered
himself that the natural termination of the power of that chieftain,
should he live to see it, would certainly be the beginning of his
own.</p>

<p>As soon as the late Saga had established his influence over the people
of Eonee, the sagacious Chuheluh set himself to win his favor, with the
hope of using him for the advancement of his own purposes. He was not
long in succeeding so far as to obtain from the Saga the desired promise,
that he would do for him his utmost, not only to secure to him the
succession, when the important event occurred, but seize any opportunity
that might present itself to hasten its advance. But various plausible
pretexts were, from time to time, resorted to by the Saga to defer the
consummation of their joint plans. His patience was often nearly
exhausted, but something propitious would occur to renew his hopes and
his confidence in the Saga. His interference in Welch's behalf, after he
had made him his dupe, so far as to kill the Leech, was, at first, but
the impulse of grateful kindness; but when Eoneguski had taken the part
of avenger, a new motive was given to his tutelary concern for Welch. If
Eoneguski should perish in the pursuit, without any blame or suspicion
attaching to himself, his own way would be made clear and even; and to
send the pursuer home bootless, would tend to disgrace him, and increase
the chances for the success of a competitor.</p>

<p>It was no wonder, then, that the Fox took so much pains to secure
Welch from the grasp of Eoneguski, but had it been in his power, it was
not his wish, to have removed him so far beyond his reach, as that he
should cease to operate as a decoy bird, leading him from home, into
scenes of difficulty and danger. The failure of Welch's health, however,
rendered the farther prosecution of this plan impracticable, and forced
the Fox to abandon it for some other, by which to gratify his ambitious
longings. He returned home, freighted with new materials for
operation.</p>

<p>He had known Soquilla previously to the battle of Etchoe, and heard of
his disappointed love for Yenacona, whose child had disappeared at that
place. Years afterwards, when Susquanannacunahata established himself as
a Saga at Sugar Town, Chuheluh, notwithstanding his disguise, was struck
with a resemblance to the lost Soquilla. Still he took it for granted he
was what he pretended, and the matter passed off from his memory. When,
however, on a visit to him, concerning the affair of Welch, he perceived
the agitation of the Saga, the suspicion came upon him that Soquilla and
Susquanannacunahata were one; and when he left the hut, he lingered for
some moments on the outside, and overheard the soliloquy, and received
confirmation to his suspicion, with the information that Soquilla had
attempted to destroy the child of Yenacona, who had, however, escaped,
and was yet alive in the person of Welch. He then stole off silently, so
that it might not be known he had heard any thing, although the use he
should make of the information he had obtained was not then determined
on.</p>

<p>On his return from escorting Welch, he forthwith proceeded to the
wigwam of the Saga, and familiarly addressed him as Soquilla. The Saga
was startled.&mdash;&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Chuheluh, &ldquo;it is time
we should understand each other&mdash;you have long enough amused me with
promises you never intended to fulfil. Soquilla knew not there was an eye
upon him, when the helpless Oocomoo was cast into the flames.&mdash;Come,
let us be friends.&mdash;The Saga can serve Chuheluh, and Chuheluh can
destroy the Saga.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No man is so hardened or self-possessed, as not to yield to the
overwhelming effect of the literal reading, in his hearing, of facts he
supposed secret.&mdash;Soquilla confessed all, and the early destruction
of Eonah, and Chuheluh's appointment in his stead, was the price agreed
upon for the keeping, by the latter, the secrets of the Saga. The illness
of Eonah, and his calling in the assistance of the Saga, presented a
favorable occasion for the fulfilment of his engagement, to which he was
most importunately urged by his confederate. But Wissa, who was present
at all their conferences, determined to defeat their plans. He apprised
Eonah of his danger, and his acquaintance with his master's unwritten
herbal, supplied him with the proper antidote. It was in this fortunate
way that Eonah escaped falling into the pit he had himself contributed to
dig; for, as we have seen, it was his own countenance to which
Susquanannacunahata was indebted for much of his influence and power, to
do mischief among the people of the Valley. But his sagacity had
penetrated the dangerous nature of the Saga, before it had become the
interest of that master of deceit to destroy him.</p>

<p>Some years after the Saga's establishment at Sugar Town, the necessity
for some familiar was apparent, and his desire to procure one was
communicated to Eonah. The chief very early entertained suspicions of
Soquilla's fidelity, and was anxious to provide himself with a spy upon
his actions, and a fortunate occasion was now presented for so doing. He
undertook to supply him with a person suitable to his purpose, and, with
the assistance of Mercury, procured Wissa, and fully instructed him in
the part he was to act. Wissa very successfully affected both deafness
and its necessary attendant, when connate with its subject, dumbness. The
facility with which he comprehended, and obeyed or answered, the signs
given him, delighted the Saga. In short, his new master found him all
that he could desire, and never for a moment suspected that his
misfortunes were feigned, until their fatal descent down the mountain, or
that, through his agency, Eonah was put in possession from time to time
of all that it was material for him to know respecting his movements.
Wissa's fidelity to Eonah was made quite secure, by the assurance of his
freedom, upon well doing, whenever the life of the Saga should cease;
and, at the same time, to remove any temptation from the lad to
accelerate the day of his liberation, any practises upon the life of his
master should operate, he was told, as a forfeiture of all his
claims.</p>

<p>Chuheluh was deeply disappointed when the Saga's drugs failed in
putting an immediate period to the life of Eonah. He strongly suspected
the Great Medicine of a want of fidelity in the performance of his part
of their compact, and his suspicions were confirmed, when, to the
assembled elders, Eoneguski was nominated as the favorite of Heaven for
the succession to his father. In the first transports of passion he was
about denouncing him as an impostor, and exposing the whole of his
wickedness, when he perceived the tide setting too strongly against
himself to hope for a favorable hearing. He therefore prudently withdrew,
in haste and secrecy. But it was with a heart burning with vengeance,
which he resolved speedily to visit upon the pretended Saga. He according
procured an accomplice, waylaid the helpless old man, with the intention
of destroying him, by opportunely setting fire to the woods, in the
belief that the flames, proving too rapid for the dull heavy cattle, both
they and their owner would be offered as burnt sacrifices to the spirit
of Revenge, of which the latter had been so faithful a worshipper.</p>

<p>The result has already been shown, and, as soon as Chuheluh saw, or
rather heard, the frightened cattle coming over the mountain without
either cart or driver, he concluded that a catastrophe very grateful to
himself had left them without an owner, and those feelings of cupidity,
always exceedingly powerful in their action upon his mind, united with
some untimely suggestions of prudence, to make beef of the animals, lest
they might attract attention.</p>

<p>This was not the first occasion on which his dexterity with the bow
proved available to the Fox, for the moon was no sooner risen than he
pursued the oxen, and, with the assistance of his comrade, noiselessly
slaughtered them, and carried them to his own home. Here they would have
remained secretly enough, but for the active Wissa, who, although he
might not have been entirely unmoved by the belief that, as the only
member of the family of the Saga, the cattle of right belonged to
himself; yet was he chiefly actuated by a desire to disgrace and bring to
justice the ancient enemy of his patron Eonah, and the present competitor
of Eoneguski, whom he loved.</p>

<p>The detection and punishment with which Chuheluh was righteously
overtaken, were not deplored by him so much on their own account, as
their being the final overthrow of all those ambitious hopes which,
notwithstanding their frequent and signal disappointments, had hitherto
been, to him, the main spring of action, and sole source of anticipated
happiness. But now that he had undergone public and degrading punishment,
he could not hope to be acknowledged as a chieftain among the proud
Cherokees.</p>

<p><br>
                          Friendship is constant in all other things<br>
                          Save in the office and affairs of love,<br>
                          Therefore all hearts in love use their own
tongues.</p>

<p align="right">SHAKSPEARE.</p>

<p>IN turning the face homewards after a long absence, the joyous
thoughts that fill the mind are not unfrequently mingled with others
quite as painful as those that attended the departure. Undefined
apprehensions of many and unfavorable changes in persons and scenes
remembered with kindness and affection, steal in and make sad the heart.
Sometimes a guilty sense of change in the heart itself, forbids it to
anticipate a cheerful welcome by those towards whom it is conscious of
having weakened its allegiance. Sometimes the very excess of joyful
anticipation conveys a melancholy admonition of the proneness of all
earthly hopes to deceive and disappoint. Pure and sinless, or light and
frivolous, must be the bosom in which joy dances alone, in its return,
after wandering upon the earth, to the peaceful ark from whence it set
out. At least the feelings of Gideon Aymor were not so unmingled, when,
in compliance with his promise to Yenacona, he set out with reluctant
footsteps to visit his father's home, after the funeral festivities of
Eonah were ended.</p>

<p>He found his family impatient for his return, and many were the
inquiries why he had been so long absent. They were interested in the
recital of such parts of his adventures as he thought proper to
communicate, including every thing, in fact, except his imprudence at
Waynesville, and his ignoble passion for the Little Deer. In the latter
affair he could not think of encountering the wrath of his father, which,
he doubted not, would be stirred into transports still more violent, when
a family alliance with a full-blooded Indian was the
subject&mdash;tremendous as it had been when one, whose ruddy tinge was
scarcely perceptible, ventured to make such proposals.</p>

<p>They were all deeply affected by the account of Welch's
parentage&mdash;and the pale emaciated Atha felt her heart overflowing
with filial tenderness towards the pious and afflicted Yenacona, whom,
she trusted, one day personally to behold.</p>

<p>Dolly kissed Gideon as she would have done a babe, and was delighted
at once more beholding her first-born son&mdash;and &ldquo;I'll never
stir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if there's any use talking about it&mdash;I
do believe I love Giddy more than all the rest of you put
together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was as good, nay, better than her word, with respect to the
clothing&mdash;for an entire new suit had been provided for the youth,
with which he was not a little gratified, thinking they might give him a
more advantageous appearance at Tesumtoe, whither, he hoped, shortly to
find some pretext for returning.</p>

<p>But Gideon had not a few difficulties to encounter in making up his
accounts at home. The old man inquired with some solicitude into the fate
of the ten hard dollars, and Gideon, by stammering and hesitating, and
having always to turn back when he had gotten partly through with the
tale, and make a new beginning, succeeded, finally, in wearing out his
patience, and thus escaped the avowal of his shame, or the actual
utterance of a falsehood; which latter, however glibly he might have done
with others, he seldom felt safe in attempting under the penetrating
glance of his father.</p>

<p>To Atha he was forced, again and again, to repeat all that concerned
Welch, and to witness the renewed conflict of passion, which each recital
produced, threatening, in its violence, the immediate destruction of a
frame once healthy and robust, but now alarmingly delicate and
attenuated.</p>

<p>But these were not all the difficulties with which Gideon was beset.
On the very morning after his arrival&mdash;&ldquo;Run over,&rdquo; said
his mother to one of the younger children, &ldquo;to Sile Stevens', and
tell Patty that Giddy's come home&mdash;and that she must come right over
and see him.&mdash;Run, I say.&mdash;I tell you what, Giddy,&rdquo;
continued she&mdash;&ldquo;if you'd a staid much longer, you wouldn't a
been in time to a seen even the burying of Patty&mdash;you can't think
how she's taken on about you.&mdash;The poor cretur denies it, and says
it's nothing but low spirits and loss of appetite that ails her&mdash;she
talked of getting well when the weather moderated, and she could go out
into the fields, and take more exercise&mdash;but we all knew better; and
if you were the man you ought to be, you'd a gone right over this morning
the first thing, and seed her yourself, and not a waited for me to send
for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Gideon, with some
confusion&mdash;&ldquo;what is Patty Stevens to me, that I should be in
such a hurry to go over and see her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Giddy,&rdquo; replied his mother&mdash;&ldquo;don't be a
fool, or try to make your mother one. Don't we all know that you and
Patty Stevens are as good as engaged to be married, and that you are to
be married as soon as you are a little older, and get settled?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Other people know more about my affairs than I do myself,
then&mdash;I am sure I never thought any more of Patty Stevens than of
other girls in the neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, brother!&rdquo; said Atha, in a tone of voice which
plainly indicated that she was in doubt whether to consider the speaker
in jest or in earnest, together with indignant disappointment if she was
to believe the latter&mdash;&ldquo;is it possible you can say you have
never thought any more of Patty Stevens than other girls in the
neighborhood?&mdash;If it is true, Gideon,&rdquo; she continued, adopting
that tone and manner, so dignified and yet so animated, with which a
virtuous woman always speaks of a base action&mdash;&ldquo;you are a bad
man.&mdash;Yes, my own brother, as you are, if what you are now saying is
true, you have cruelly deceived poor Patty Stevens, and have acted the
part of a villain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cloud of displeasure flitted across the face of Gideon, as he heard
his sister couple the word villain with his name, while conscience
whispered &ldquo;It is a just association.&rdquo; But, for many reasons,
it was not his cue to be angry, and assuming a dignified gravity of
manner&mdash;&ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;this, from another,
I should have resented, but you know you may say to me what you
please&mdash;yet you have deceived yourself.&mdash;Patty Stevens, I know,
will not, cannot say, that I have ever spoken to her of marriage, or
given her any reason to suppose that I have thought of her as a wife. I
may have paid her some little attentions when I have met her, such as are
common between young men and women, but nothing farther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will not do, Gideon.&mdash;Is it to me you have the
boldness to say you have never done more than pay to Patty Stevens such
little attentions as are common among young people?&mdash;Was I not
present last fall, on that beautiful moon-light evening, when, sitting by
the fountain, you chose all pretty things, of earth and air, to represent
the beauties and excellencies you told her she possessed beyond all
others of her sex?&mdash;And, ah! Gideon, did she not believe the
flattering tale?&mdash;Were not her blushes seen even by the pale
moon-beam?&mdash;And were not the tell-tale beatings of her heart heard,
as she bent her listening ear? Tell me not that you have forgotten
this.&mdash;Did I not mark the triumphant sparkle of your eye which
seemed to say, 'She is mine,' as you drew her towards you, and she leaned
upon you confidingly?&mdash;But I perceive it is past, and I must add to
my other sorrows that of seeing my sensitive young friend perish in the
bloom of her girlhood, from the cruel inconstancy of my own
brother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose from her seat, and, as she turned off indignantly, left the
conscience-stricken Gideon to his own reflections.</p>

<p>Patty Stevens, the subject of the foregoing discussion, was a pretty
innocent girl, whose father occupied a farm adjoining that of Robert
Aymor, and various circumstances seemed to concur in marking her out as
the destined wife of Gideon. And whether it was the frequent expression
of this thought, in the hearing of the parties, or some other cause, it
so happened that neither of them showed any aversion to having, in due
time, fulfilled what was so generally prophesied. Patty Stevens, like
Atha Aymor, was one of those persons who seem naturally gifted with a
sense of delicacy and propriety, and elegance of manners, not usual in
their sphere of life. These, with a handsome face and person, and great
goodness of heart, (with which they are apt to be associated,) assured
her an interest in all who became acquainted with her. Her cheerfulness
of manner was such as simple innocence usually displays, until a short
time before our story opens, when a marked change took place, and she
became serious and abstracted. It was probably about this time that the
scene described by Atha, occurred at the fountain, and the most likely
cause of this change was, that Gideon had avowed himself her lover.</p>

<p>The heart of a virgin is like the outspread surface of a clear smooth
lake, which faithfully reflects in freshness the flower that grows on its
margin&mdash;the green glossy leaf that hangs over it&mdash;the clear sky
suspended like a vast azure curtain above it&mdash;the soft mild
countenances of the moon and stars&mdash;and the bright joyous face of
the sun, just as it receives them. It is alike a stranger to concealment
and impurity. But the breath of love passes over the one, and the winds
of Heaven over the other, and the surface of each is ruffled, and the
unsuspected dregs, deeply deposited by nature, are stirred up. The placid
smoothness is no more&mdash;the sparkling brightness has
vanished;&mdash;it no longer reflects, like a mirror, what it
receives&mdash;nor artlessly exposes to view its own contents.</p>

<p>Such was the change in Patty Stevens. She was thoughtful&mdash;she was
absent;&mdash;now she was pale&mdash;and now the color came rushing to
her cheeks, and none knew why. The song no more accompanied the merry
whirring of her wheel, or, if she sang, her notes were sad and plaintive.
No more she ate, as one who labored for her daily bread&mdash;but
sparingly and seldom. Her parents were alarmed at these changes in their
daughter, and sought, without success, from her, who scarcely knew the
reason why she was less happy than in former days. She only felt it would
distress her to believe herself an object of indifference to Gideon
Aymor, and yet his declaration that he loved her, had disturbed the
simple joy of her heart, and she was less happy than before. An
undefinable anxiety haunted her perpetually, and she found herself
frequently constrained to relieve, by tears, a heart full, almost to
bursting, with she knew not what. She was burthened with a consciousness
that she could not now, as in former days, unbosom to her mother, without
blushing, every thought of her heart; and yet so holy were her feelings,
that, even had the power been given, she would not have drawn the
thinnest veil between her own bosom and the searching eye of Heaven.</p>

<p>More and more marked grew the symptoms of change in Patty Stevens,
until Gideon Aymor's departure for the Indian country, and then did they
increase with a rapidity which alarmed every one who knew her, and then
did the least sagacious among her acquaintances solve her mystery without
farther difficulty. Unsuspicious of being, as she was, the talk of the
neighborhood, the poor girl &ldquo;let concealment, like a worm i'the
bud, prey,&rdquo; not only &ldquo;on her damask cheek,&rdquo; but on the
very seat of life. Hectic fever had already hung out the banner of his
triumph in her slightly flushed cheek and preternaturally bright eye,
when Gideon returned.</p>

<p>She was sitting with her mother, in conversation more than commonly
cheerful, and with greater apparent strength than was her wont, when the
breathless ambassadress of Dolly Aymor announced her message. No painter
on earth could have caught them both at the same time, and it would have
been a difficult matter to have chosen between the interesting intensity
of expression in the two faces of the mother and daughter. In both was
something of surprise, at the thoughtless vulgarity, or unfeeling
rudeness, of the message&mdash;for they were at some loss which to
consider it. But in the mother's was, also, that alarmed apprehension
which would probably have been produced by seeing a pistol suddenly
discharged at her beloved child; for nothing less fatal did she
anticipate from the shock upon her delicate system of the tidings
communicated. But we must leave to the imagination of the reader the
mingled play of passion in the bright flashing eye, the thin delicate
features, and pale lips of the daughter, who, at length, fixing a keen
look upon the child, &ldquo;Was Mr. Aymor by,&rdquo; she said, calmly,
&ldquo;when your mother sent you with this message?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied the artless respondent, &ldquo;Gideon
was by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell your mother, then,&rdquo; she continued, with a composure
which altogether surprised her own parent, &ldquo;that Patty Stevens is
glad, for her sake, to hear of the return of her old playmate, but it is
not in her power to visit Mrs. Aymor to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child, altogether indifferent to the sort of answer she might
carry back, and quite unconscious that the one she now bore was torn, by
pride, from the bleeding heartstrings of her who sent it, flew off as
lightly as if it had been a message of peace and happiness.</p>

<p>The struggle made by Patty Stevens to conduct herself with dignity and
firmness during the short stay of the little Aymor, was entirely
successful; but she was no sooner gone, than her feelings overpowered
her, and she was compelled to betake herself to bed, where she lay for
several days in one of those unfavorable paroxysms for which consumption,
then obviously preying upon her, is so remarkable, generally succeeded by
periods of flattering and deceitful convalescence previous to the final
sacrifice of its victim.</p>

<p>The answer returned by Patty Stevens made very different impressions
upon Dolly, Atha, and Gideon.&mdash;The former understood nothing beyond
the literal signification of the words. Atha, with the sympathy of one
who fully understood her friend's character, read in it the expression of
that dignified delicacy she knew her to possess, and the question put to
her little sister, as to Gideon's presence, told also of wounded pride
and affection that scorned to complain.&mdash;Gideon was not insensible
to the reproach, couched in the language of indifference, and felt that
it was richly merited. But he had formed his plans, and nothing of this
kind could divert him from their fulfilment. Although, in point of
person, he would not have hesitated for a moment in giving to Patty
Stevens a decided preference over the Little Deer, yet the poverty of the
former, contrasted with the fortune and expectations of the latter,
together with the chieftainship of Tesumtoe, which would probably fall to
her husband, were sufficient, in the eyes of an avaricious and ambitious
man, to reverse the decision of taste, and were considerations too
prevailing with him, to allow of his return to the allegiance from which
he had been seduced. He remained for some days, making fruitless
inquiries after Welch, from whom nothing had been heard, and forming and
breaking successively resolutions to pay at least a visit of kindness to
Patty Stevens. Day succeeded day, and this visit was not paid, and his
thoughts began to turn impatiently towards the Indian country, although
the fear of his father's displeasure restrained his lips from the
expression of his wishes, and he felt conscious the unsatisfactory
tidings he would bear to Yenacona must greatly diminish the cordiality of
his reception at Tesumtoe.</p>

                          A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,<br>

<p align="right">SHAKSPEARE.</p>

<p>AN argument is sometimes founded for the immediate agency of the Evil
Spirit in human affairs, upon the frequent and appropos occurrence of
opportunities and temptations to the fulfilment of sinister purposes, it
is thought scarcely allowable to attribute to the wise and merciful
arrangement of a just Providence. Whatever may be the cause, every man's
experience will testify that opportunities to do evil have seldom failed
to wait obsequiously upon the desire&mdash;and not unfrequently
opportunity itself has presented to the mind the first suggestion of an
unlawful purpose.</p>

<p>The experience of Gideon Aymor was something of this kind&mdash;for
while he was greatly at a loss for some pretext and opportunity of
accomplishing his design to disregard his plighted promises to Patty
Stevens, the prejudices of his father, and his obligations of gratitude
and friendship to Eoneguski&mdash;the arrival of a stranger at his
father's house, seemed providentially to supply him with what he
needed.</p>

<p>It was the middle of a beautiful afternoon in the month of June, when
a large man, with a broad brimmed white hat, and a shabby suit of black,
rode up to the house of Robert Aymor on a substantial and rather elegant
horse, (which had evidently suffered neither from hard riding nor want of
food,) and requested lodging for the night. To refuse compliance with
such a request would, in that day and country, have been looked upon as
highly disgraceful to the master of any mansion&mdash;and so certain was
the applicant of success, that he scarcely waited for an answer before he
began to dismount.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the appearance of the stranger very
prepossessing, neither was it very forbidding. He was fat as well as
large in person; and a florid complexion, with a calm, inexpressive
countenance, indicated a life of ease and plentiful living. The cut of
his garments, a soft, drawling voice, such as is ascribed to Titus Oates,
the famous plotter in English history, with the style of his remarks,
proclaimed him at once an itinerant Methodist preacher. There was
something in his countenance, as Robert Aymor welcomed him to his
dwelling, that called up some early associations in the mind of the old
farmer, but he satisfied himself with the supposition that it was only a
slight resemblance to a person he had once known, who had, in all
probability, long since perished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thais ais a woild country you laive in, Mr. Aiymore, but Goad
haas been exciadingly merciful toa ye, aand gaiven ye maany sons aand
daaghters, with the mains of proviading for thair caomfort,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank God,&rdquo; replied Aymor&mdash;&ldquo;I have no
reason to complain; and as for the country, wild as you think it, sir, I
should be loath to exchange it, unless it might be for one still
wilder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aivry maan to hais oawn laiking, Maister Aiymore, but for mai
paart, Ai hoape ait wail gainerally be mai haapy loat to woarship the
Goad of mai faythers, noat amoang the haills, but in the plaain,&rdquo;
said the priest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder, stranger;&rdquo; said Aymor&mdash;&ldquo;that, seeing
you have such a dislike to our rough country, you should venture into
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ai, Maister Aiymore, aam, aas you seea, a praacher of the
goaspel, aand wharesoaaver mai Maaster caals, Ai aam boand to
foalow,&rdquo; answered the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And have you a call to preach in this neighborhood,
sir?&mdash;If so, you are heartily welcome, I assure you, for we are all
glad of an opportunity of going to meeting; but it is very seldom we have
it,&rdquo; said Aymor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mai caal, Maister Aiymore, is, blaassed be Goad, to triaals
aand daifficulties, aiven graater thaan Ai shoad haave to encounter
haare.&mdash;Ai goa to daispainse the woard of laife to the staarving
chaildren of the raid main in the Tainnesay Vaalley;&rdquo; replied the
preacher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt it's rather a hopeless undertaking you are engaged in,
then,&rdquo; said Aymor, bluntly&mdash;&ldquo;and it seems to me that
pious men like you, who are willing to make such great sacrifices to a
sense of duty, might save yourselves a vast deal of trouble, and do much
more good, by remaining among civilized people, and preaching to men and
women of your own color.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The commaand,&rdquo; replied the preacher&mdash;&ldquo;ais to
praach the goaspel to aall nations;&mdash;wai scaatter the saad abroaad
oaver the faace of the aarth, aand wai knoaw noat whaich shaall spraing
up, aand whaich shaall pairish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know but little about these things, friend,&rdquo; said
Aymor&mdash;&ldquo;but I must still think you are engaged in an
unprofitable job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thai aissue ais waith Haim who haath saant mai foarth;&rdquo;
said the preacher&mdash;&ldquo;Paal maay plaant, aand Aipolos maay
waater, but ait ais Goad who gaiveth the aincrease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither planting or watering in a poor soil will ever make
crop,&rdquo; replied the countryman&mdash;&ldquo;and it is just as
hopeless an undertaking, it seems to me, to convert the Cherokee Indians
to Christianity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ai aam soarry, fraind Aiymore, thaat you caan aiffoard mai so
laittle coansolaation, but Ai must staill saay, 'Hais waill be
doane;'&ldquo; replied the stranger.</p>

<p>For some time the preacher and his host conversed together upon the
subject of his mission to the Cherokees, without the latter being the
more convinced of its utility, or the former inclined to abandon it. By
degrees the way was prepared for a proposal, which the stranger had all
along intended to make, that is, that Aymor would allow his eldest son to
accompany the missionary as a guide into the Indian country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you were a weakly man,&rdquo; said Aymor&mdash;&ldquo;in
common charity I would allow my son to accompany you, not as a
guide&mdash;for the track is easily enough found&mdash;but to assist you
in making your way through the difficulties you may have to
encounter.&mdash;But you are altogether too stout a man to require any
other help than that of your own gigantic arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the stranger was before solicitous for a guide, he was now doubly
so, and pressed Aymor with renewed zeal to allow Gideon to accompany
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for danger,&rdquo; continued Aymor, seeming rather to pursue
the current of his own reflections, than to give attention or make any
direct answer to the appeals of the stranger&mdash;&ldquo;there would
really be none, if it were not for your horse; and, for that reason, you
had better take it on foot; for the Cherokees are perfect devils for
horse stealing, and rather than miss a fine animal like yours, I scarcely
think your missionary character would be any security against the
tomahawk and scalping-knife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The missionary became pale as death, and, as he turned his bloodless
countenance with a horrid stare upon his host, the latter beheld, as in a
picture, the very expression worn by the unfortunate Thompson, when they
found themselves, during Rutherford's campaign, suddenly in the midst of
the Indian ambuscade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I live!&rdquo; said Aymor&mdash;&ldquo;it is he, and my
first impression was right&mdash;your name is Thompson, sir, and no
offence, I hope, but I see that putting on a black coat any more than a
red one, will not make a man brave, who is not so by nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thoampson ais mai naame, Ai must oawn;&rdquo; replied the
preacher.&mdash;&ldquo;Ai thoaght, Maister Aiymore, Ai woald noat maake
maiself knoawn to ye, but ait ais, perhaaps, aas waall aas ait ais; foar
surely, Maister Aiymore, you waill noat refuse to aan oald aacquaintance
the vary smaall request Ai waas maaking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly, I can hardly find it in my heart,&rdquo; replied
Aymor&mdash;&ldquo;and it happens fortunately for you, that Gideon is
fresh from that country, and can tell you all about it beforehand, as
well as lead you from place to place, when you are there, and make you
acquainted with such persons as you may desire to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The assent thus obtained, was a great relief to Thompson, who passed a
most agreeable evening with his old friend in talking over by-gone times,
and did not fail to avail himself of every occasion of obtaining from
Gideon information respecting the persons and places they might meet with
in their projected journey.</p>

<p>Much dissatisfied was every member of Aymor's family, except Gideon
himself, at the arrangement made with Thompson; and even Aymor was not at
heart much pleased with what he had done, but could not think of
retracting a promise given in the warmth of feelings excited by the
unexpected discovery of an old, though not highly esteemed, acquaintance.
To Gideon nothing could be more opportune, and he actually felt towards
the preacher as to a benefactor who had, from mere benevolence, travelled
out of his way to render him a great kindness.</p>

<p>Every thing was in readiness the next morning for Gideon's departure,
and though the plan of the march was not exactly to his liking, he yet
preferred any thing to remaining at home. He thought that equality
wanting which should exist between fellow travellers, in his trudging on
foot, while his more fortunate companion was mounted on a good horse, and
murmuringly mentioned it. Aymor proposed to obviate the difficulty by
allowing Thompson to leave the horse in his care until his return,
&ldquo;And if,&rdquo; said he smiling, &ldquo;the Indians should take it
in their heads to make a martyr of you, Thompson, I can adopt the old
saying&mdash;'It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good.'&ldquo;</p>

<p>This mode of putting the matter did not tend to reconcile Thompson to
the proposed arrangement; on the contrary, as safety was with him at all
times a very important consideration, and he could not but feel it more
within his reach on horseback than on foot, in a wild country, it added
to the firmness of his purpose not to part with his horse. But in truth,
the shortness of breath, which the reader may remember was an early
infirmity of Thompson, had not been cured by time, but remained to
disqualify him altogether for pedestrianism, and he therefore promptly
refused to leave his horse behind him.</p>

<p>It was next proposed as a means of putting the travellers on an
equality, that they should adopt the expedient called&mdash;riding and
tying. But this was, if possible, still more abhorrent to the Rev. Mr.
Thompson than leaving his horse altogether; for, besides subjecting him
to labor, to which he was altogether inadequate, he would be exposed
among the mountain wilds without any one to keep up his spirits by
conversation, or to defend him in case of actual danger. Nothing remained
then but for Aymor to stretch his generosity still farther, and not only
part with his son to accommodate his friend, but also supply him with a
horse, saddle and bridle.</p>

<p>A victor mounted upon a noble war-horse, with splendid trappings,
found among the spoils of his vanquished rival, could not have been more
elated than Gideon at this additional stroke of fortune, which placed him
upon a tolerable animal, in effect his own, on his return to push his
half accomplished plans in the Indian country.</p>

<p>The travellers were at length upon the road, and a part of the way was
beguiled by making and answering inquiries concerning the different
things they saw, and what and whom they would be likely to encounter in
their farther progress. But conversation could be maintained between them
only with great effort, and that constraint which always prevails on both
sides when persons of dissimilar ages, habits, and modes of thinking, are
thrown together, left each of the travellers much time to amuse himself
with his own thoughts, or to study the accidental developments of the
others' character.</p>

<p>Gideon kept in restraint the natural levity, and even wickedness of
his own, not altogether from respect to the clerical habit of his
associate, but also from an unaccountable inclination to impose himself
upon the parson as one very moral, and having some pretensions to piety.
On the other hand he found at intervals his companion breaking in upon
the usual gravity of his manner, and then hastily resuming it again,
watching at the same time the effect upon Gideon of such expressions as
might slightly savour of levity or irreverence; like one occasionally
peeping out from a disguise to see whether he may venture to throw it off
altogether, or a person cautiously feeling his way over ground where he
suspects the safety of his footing. Thus encouraged, Gideon gradually
lowered his pretensions to propriety, and the preacher's moments of
incautious levity became more frequent, until the former began to think
that a parson after all when fully found out, is much like other men.</p>

<p>As they journeyed on they lost more and more of their original
frigidity, until the ice was fairly melted between them, and, by the
expiration of the first day, one had little to learn of the other, at
least so each imagined for himself, while at the same time he probably
laid to his soul the flattering unction that he had learned more than he
had taught.</p>

<p align="right">OLD PLAY.</p>

<p>AT length, as the travellers found themselves beyond the older
settlements, the scenery became more wild, and the way more lonely. There
was no more levity in the manner of the missionary, but restless anxiety
and starting apprehensiveness assumed over it an uninterrupted dominion.
The mind of Thompson, although no way remarkable for strength, was not
deficient in fancy, and this may probably account for the extreme
timidity of his disposition; for his imagination, fertile in suggesting
subjects of apprehension, did not find in his reason a correspondent
power of distinguishing between the real and the false, and penetrating
through the first appearances of things into their actual nature.</p>

<p>It is not likely, then, he would be insensible to the beauties of the
varied scenery through which he was passing; on the contrary, but for the
gloom that a sense of insecurity threw over the whole, few men could be
more alive to the rich variety of pictures presented to his eye.
Sometimes he found himself passing between two lofty peaks, aspiring high
towards Heaven, and holding each other in rivalry, while the trees with
which they were crowned, appeared to reach over from one mountain in the
direction of the other, with their varigated foliage, as if endeavoring
to span the chasm between. Here the luxuriant pea-vine, with its
beautiful blossoms, hung for miles the steep hill side with interminable
garlands, and there a bare rock, indistinctly seen through the waving
shrubbery, assumed an antic shape, or rose a majestic castle, which fancy
inhabited with some gigantic tenant of the wilds.&mdash;Here, high on the
cliff, an adventurous rustic had located his rude dwelling, overlooking
the country for miles around, and having in its elevation more the
appearance of a retreat for some winged inhabitant of the air, than for a
being who must trust to the labor of climbing to reach his
home.&mdash;There, where two opposite mountains by receding from each
other, seemed abruptly broken off, the winding way suddenly opened in a
beautiful vista, upon a little plain, so perfectly level as to form a
delightful contrast with all that surrounded it. In these very choice
spots, few and far between, as if to heighten to the utmost the contrast,
human labor had been industriously expended in snatching them with speed
from the wild dominion of nature, giving them the appearance of old
settlements, and even making in their embellishment considerable displays
of taste.</p>

<p>In one of them a neat little dwelling rose in the midst, whose newly
whitened chinking gave it a cool snow-like appearance, standing out as it
did in striking relief from the dark green mountain side, forming its
back ground. Near it was the orchard, laden with the promises of a future
luscious supply, with here and there a tree of earlier kind, even now
holding out upon its bending branches the fully ripe fruit. Not far
distant was the field of Indian corn, waving in the southern breeze its
long broad leaves, and filling the air with the yellow pollen from its
tassels.&mdash;Meadows, over whose rich verdure herds and flocks were
scattered, or having been reserved for the purpose, offering a heavy
harvest to the mower's scythe, skirted along the clear rapid stream, to
which the lovely valley owed all its fertility and beauty, if not its
existence, as did the famous Tempe to Peneus. Babbling along through this
little Eden, the brook soon came in rude contact with the base of one of
the mountains, where they again approached each other, and ran dashing
and foaming for miles through a solitary wild, where our travellers were
forced to follow it in their journey. Yet nothing befell them, worthy of
particular notice, until they passed the Cowee Mountain, and found
themselves in the great Tennessee Valley.</p>

<p>It was early in the morning when they were suddenly surrounded by
Indians, armed with rifles, and all bending their course in the same
direction with themselves. The woods appeared to be teeming with its red
children, sending them forth as some huge molehill is wont to do the
swarming emmets. It may well be supposed it was not the missionary spirit
which at that moment filled the soul of Thompson. Concern for his own
bodily safety absorbed all interest in the spiritual dangers of those, in
search of whom he had travelled so far, to snatch them as brands from the
burning. He had the prudence, however, to suppress any expression of
uneasiness, and left Gideon to find out, in his own way, what these
alarming indications meant. He was not, himself, without a suspicion that
it might betoken the accomplishment, to his hand, of the main object of
his mission, yet that did not serve to mitigate much his apprehensions,
as a misconception of his character, against which he had no security,
might be absolutely fatal to him.</p>

<p>Gideon, on his part, was not long in entering into conversation with
one of the Indians, in his own language, and obtaining from him a partial
solution of the cause of this unusual excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said the Indian, pointing to a field of corn, upon
the margin of the river that rolled beyond it, &ldquo;the Great Spirit
has sent bread to his red children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gideon did as he was directed, and, not without some surprise,
perceived that the corn was already in that state commonly called
&ldquo;roasting-ear,&rdquo; while the most forward he had left behind him
was scarcely more than just &ldquo;shooting and tasselling.&rdquo; This
reminded him again of the saying of Eoneguski, in relation to the
superior mildness of climate of the Tennessee Valley over other parts of
the mountain region.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you yet,&rdquo; he said, addressing the
Indian.&mdash;&ldquo;What has yon field of corn to do with this
assembling of your people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; said the Indian, &ldquo;the Oewoehee dance the
Yenacona. The Great Spirit has sent rain upon the earth, and the sweet
roasting-ear has come, and the Indian eats it, and is glad, and his heart
pours out its joy to the Great Spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gideon knew too well the character of the common Indian, to expect
from one of them any thing like a clear explanation. Enough had been told
him to enable him to perceive that some Indian ceremony was to be
performed, indicative of their gratitude to the Great Spirit, for having
sent them rain and fruitful seasons. He was struck, too, with the
identity of the name mentioned by the Indian with that of the aunt of the
Little Deer, and remembered that she had told him of her being named
after one of the festivals of the Oewoehee.</p>

<p>Having communicated to Thompson the result of his inquiries, the mind
of that worthy personage was relieved, and he fell into a train of
reflections upon what he had just heard. &ldquo;Ai haave oaften haerde,
fraind Gaideon,&rdquo; he at length broke silence, &ldquo;thaat the
aaborigines of our laand are the tain traibes of the children of Aisrael,
whaich haave oatherwaise bain aintirely loast, and whaat you haave jaist
communicated saims graately to faivour thaat balaife. We raid in Hoaly
Wrait thaat, by Divain authority, the choasen people waare requaired to
oaffer unto Jehoavah the fairst fruits of aall thair aincraise, and the
faistive cealebraation of thaise people saims vaary laike a realict oaf
thaat aancient caustom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it may be so,&rdquo; said Gideon, impatiently,
&ldquo;but, in the name of Heaven, Parson, why don't you talk faster, it
tires me to death to listen to you, taking an hour to say what another
man would do in five minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo; 'Bea noat raash waith thai mouath,' saiath the waise maan,
aand Ai do waal, Maister Aiymore, not to be haasty of spaich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our travellers had now come in view of a large concourse of Indians,
of both sexes, in a sort of encampment, and many fires were kindled on a
plain near the river, around which crowds were busily engaged, as if in
some species of cookery. Upon a nearer approach, they perceived it was
Indian corn the natives were roasting in the shuck, and as each ear was
thought to be sufficiently cooked, it was deposited in a basket, whereof
many were provided for the purpose.</p>

<p>Gideon and his companion mingled in the crowd without attracting much
attention, every one being apparently absorbed in what was going
on.&mdash;The former, however, encountered many acquaintances, who seemed
pleased to see him, and with whom he conversed freely, and obtained more
explicit information respecting the ceremony in which they were engaged.
At length he met with Eoneguski, by whom he was welcomed back into the
Indian country with cordiality, and asked of his success in inquiring
after Welch.&mdash;Gideon made Eoneguski acquainted with Thompson, as
well as with the object of his visit to the Valley, and his having
accompanied him as a guide.</p>

<p>Eoneguski was as the chief of the Eonee, the master of ceremonies on
the present occasion&mdash;no prophet having yet succeeded in the Valley
the deceased Susquanannacunahata. All the corn being now prepared and
deposited in baskets, Eoneguski approached one of them, and, taking from
it an ear, commenced eating, and his example was soon followed by all
present, except Gideon and the missionary, who waited for an invitation,
which they were not, however, long in receiving. Gideon found no
difficulty in disposing of his roasting-ear as quickly as the best Indian
among them, but his companion was, in the first place, greatly
embarrassed with the shuck, and, when he had finally succeeded in
stripping that off, was very awkward in removing the grains of corn with
his teeth, observing to Gideon, in an under tone, that he was not much
accustomed to &ldquo;aating like a hoarse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This very intelligible part of the ceremony being suspended, our two
neophytes waited with some interest for the next proceeding, when
Eoneguski, taking up his rifle, carefully examined its condition, and,
opening the pan, looked to the situation of the priming, and, not seeming
to be satisfied with it, threw it out and put in fresh. His example in
this, also, was followed by the other male Indians. The young chief then
grasping his rifle by the middle, sprang forward, with a shrill whoop,
into a measured tread, accompanied by a chant, wild and monotonous, to
the effect following:&mdash;</p>

<p><br>
                          The Great Spirit dwells in the blue air
above&mdash;<br>
                          His sun shines upon us in beauty and
love&mdash;<br>
                          He sends down his rain, all the mountain
streams swelling,<br>
                          And plenty is found in each Cherokee
dwelling.</p>

<p><br>
                          The corn-stalks wave thickly abroad o'er each
field&mdash;<br>
                          Connehany and bread to the papoos they
yield;<br>
                          While the squaw tends the corn in the vale by
the river,<br>
                          The brave treads the mountain with strung bow
and quiver.</p>

<p><br>
                          Hark! a sound loud and distant now visits the
ear&mdash;<br>
                          Is it mutt'ring thunder from clouds, that I
hear?<br>
                          No! 'tis<a href="#n1">*</a> Yo-ne-sa-ha, with
his legions comes rushing,</p>

<p><a name="n1"></a></p>

<p>* Yo-ne-sa-ha, signifies the Buffalo.</p>

<br>
<br>
                          Like winter-swell'd torrents from mountain
sides gushing.

<p><br>
                          His flesh is provided for sav'ry
meat&mdash;<br>
                          For the Cherokee youth who is fearless and
fleet&mdash;<br>
                          His skin forms a mantle&mdash;when nightly
watch keeping&mdash;<br>
                          Or a couch for the brave&mdash;while in peace
he is sleeping.</p>

<p><br>
                          See! the woods are alive with the elk and the
deer&mdash;<br>
                          The beaver, the bear, and the otter are
here&mdash;<br>
                          On the hill, on the plain, in the deep mountain
hollow,<br>
                          There is game of all sorts for the Indian to
follow.</p>

<p><br>
                          The Great Spirit sends us all hearts that are
brave&mdash;<br>
                          No hand brings the red man to bow as a
slave&mdash;<br>
                          We loudly shout forth&mdash;let the universe
hear us&mdash;<br>
                          Who wakes up our vengeance may tremblingly fear
us.</p>

<p><br>
                          Then thanks to the Spirit our fathers who
blest,<br>
                          And call'd them away in their glory to
rest&mdash;<br>
                          Let us strive by brave deeds&mdash;though we
linger behind them&mdash;<br>
                          When call'd from this land&mdash;with the
blessed to find them.</p>

<p><br>
                          Let friendship and kindness forever unite,<br>
                          Our hearts in a chain strong, and lasting, and
bright&mdash;<br>
                          The Oewoehee race then like you noble
river,<br>
                          Rolling on, shall continue forever and
ever.</p>

<p>So far as the only two white men present were able to discover, there
was no fixed rule by which the Cherokee chief regulated his course,
further than that after various meanderings, he described irregular
circles, and used gesticulations suited to the different parts of the
song. In all this he was strictly followed in succession by every male
Indian present, armed like himself. When they had kept up this exercise
for several minutes, they all stopped at once, like the several portions
of a complicated machine at the touching of a certain spring;&mdash;the
song ceased, and elevating the muzzles of their rifles, they discharged
them in the air. Reloading them, the same process was gone through,
several times, until their guns had been twelve times discharged, when
they were laid aside, and the dance resumed, which was now joined in by
the women, as it appeared, promiscuously with the men.</p>

<p>The measure of the chant was changed, as well as the words, which were
to the effect following:&mdash;</p>

<p><br>
                          Ev'ry thing around is love&mdash;<br>
                          Earth beneath&mdash;and Heav'n above&mdash;<br>
                          Affection in the early beam<br>
                          Lights upon th' inconstant stream.<br>
                          The clouds descend in kissing
show'rs&mdash;<br>
                          Nature smiles in op'ning flow'rs&mdash;<br>
                          Wooing winds young leaflets kiss&mdash;<br>
                          And the leaflets stir with bliss.<br>
                          Objects still&mdash;and those that
move&mdash;<br>
                          All confess the pow'r of love.<br>
                          Why should man alone be found&mdash;<br>
                          (Who with love should most abound,)<br>
                          To deny its gentle pow'r,<br>
                          In this kind and genial hour?<br>
                          Lot him love his God on high&mdash;<br>
                          Who sheds His love o'er earth and
sky&mdash;<br>
                          All objects let him love in common&mdash;<br>
                          And most of all&mdash;bewitching woman.</p>

<p>This being ended, Eoneguski addressed the crowd, who listened with
mute attention to an oration of considerable length, inculcating the
advantages of union, and dependence on the Great Spirit; after which they
resumed the eating of corn, until all that had been prepared was
consumed.</p>

<p>It was now evening, and the Indians separated, seeking their homes by
the various trails along which they had come together in the morning.
Gideon and Thompson became the guests of Eoneguski at Eonee.</p>

<p>Impatient as was Gideon to reach Tesumtoe, and as specious a pretence
as his business with Yenacona afforded, he could not break through the
various excuses of Thompson to remain at Eonee.</p>

<p>During their sojourn at that place, it did not escape his observation
that Thompson sought various and protracted interviews with Eoneguski,
which the latter after the first two or three, seemed anxious to avoid.
But Gideon was not disposed to attribute them to any other object than
such as might be connected with his clerical mission.</p>

<p>Happening one day to be alone with Eoneguski, he perceived the mind of
the chieftain was laboring with something he wished, yet hesitated to
communicate.&mdash;At length the Indian commenced, &ldquo;I will tell my
brother a story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say on,&rdquo; replied Gideon, adopting the laconic manner of
him with whom he was conversing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A white man was hunting deer among the mountains;&rdquo; the
chief continued.&mdash;&ldquo;Many warm days had visited the earth, and
one night the snow came down silently and unlooked for, as he whose heart
is black with vengeance, steals upon his enemy. The white man for many
hours saw nothing&mdash;for the Great Spirit sent no game for his rifle.
The white man grew faint and weary. Far before him in the snow he saw
something shining with bright colors. He approached it and took it
up.&mdash;It was a snake, but the white man was not wise, and knew not
that it was a snake&mdash;and the heart of the white man was kind. 'It is
a poor creature,' he said, 'stiffened and perishing with the
cold.&mdash;I will warm it, and it shall live.' The simple white man laid
the snake in his bosom.&mdash;Soon, as if the bright sun had poured out
its warmth, it began to move. The white man heard a shrill rattle, and
cast out the traitor&mdash;but it was too late&mdash;the creature had
struck its poison to his heart, and the white man died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While he was relating this story, Eoneguski fixed not his eye upon the
countenance of Gideon, or he would there have read the conscious guilt
giving it an application entirely different from that designed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the serpent,&rdquo; thought Gideon, to himself, &ldquo;and
Eoneguski is the unwary benefactor whom I have stung in the most vital
part;&mdash;but he must proceed in a different way, if he means to get
round me.&mdash;I am not to be caught or diverted from my purpose by well
contrived stories.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother does not pity the white man;&rdquo; said
Eoneguski.</p>

<p>Gideon replied aloud, &ldquo;He deserved to perish for his
folly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wise,&rdquo; said the Indian, &ldquo;read lessons in the
folly of others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied Gideon, &ldquo;but I trust both you and I,
Eoneguski, are too wise to take a serpent to his bosom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the white man believe it was a snake he saw among the
snow?&rdquo; said Eoneguski, rising, and looking steadfastly upon Gideon.
&ldquo;Beware of Thompson,&rdquo; he added, and departed, regardless of
any solicitations for further explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beware of Thompson,&rdquo; repeated Gideon, to
himself.&mdash;&ldquo;Why?&mdash;how can that formal hypocrite, as I know
him to be, injure me? No! by Heaven, he is just such a tool as I need to
work with.&mdash;The credulous Indian I see is still unsuspicious of me
as a rival.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p align="right">SHAKSPEARE.</p>

<p>SOME such reflections as the great poet in the foregoing lines puts
into the mouth of the arch villain Iago, may be supposed to have passed
through the mind of Thompson, in contemplation of the part he had chosen
for himself, operating as it did with complicated effect upon a variety
of individuals.</p>

<p>It was the next day after Gideon's interview with Eoneguski, recorded
in the last chapter, that he set out in company with Thompson for
Tesumtoe, and arrived there in good time to be well received by Yenacona
and the Little Deer. Gideon introduced his companion to them, and
explained the object of his intended sojourn in the Indian country.
Yenacona would have been much better pleased with such an undertaking by
one of her own church, but a long separation from the society of persons
of that persuasion had softened the bigotry belonging to her sect so much
as to cause her to prefer that the light of the Gospel should be spread
among the savages even by heretics, than that they should go without it
altogether. She therefore received Thompson with quite a hearty welcome.
Her grief was at first passionate on learning Gideon's ill-success in his
search for Welch&mdash;but soon subsided into her wonted pensive
sadness</p>

<p>The soft insinuating manners of Thompson gradually won upon her, and
he soon so far prevailed with the Little Deer as to render her the first
fruits of his missionary labors. She avowed herself a Christian of the
Methodist persuasion, and received from his hands the sacraments as
administered by that church. Yenacona's orthodoxy was severely tried, but
the personal character of the preacher had so far won upon her, and her
zeal for the Little Deer becoming a Christian in any form, was so strong,
as to prevent her making any difficulty. She was the more reconciled by
the reflection, that were they to wait for union with the Church
according to the Roman ritual, the opportunity might be lost altogether
of snatching the Little Deer from the heathenism of her nation.</p>

<p>Gideon now imagined the success of his own plans certain, and that
nothing remained but for him to apprise Thompson of the manner in which
he expected his services. He hastened to do so, but did not find his
clerical friend quite so pliant as he had anticipated; for although he
did not actually refuse his assistance, he would make no promise to
afford it, but rather treated the matter as a thing to be duly
considered, before any decided action, than as one in which the path of
duty was plain. At the time of his communication, however, Gideon
perceived a smile of pleasure suddenly to light up the countenance of
Thompson, succeeded by a restlessness of manner which suffered no
abatement, until he found a pretext for returning to Eonee for a day or
two, alone.</p>

<p>Gideon made use of this occasion to do something for himself, but if
he met with nothing to produce absolute despair, there was but little to
encourage hope.&mdash;Thompson returned to Tesumtoe at the appointed
time, but evidently chapfallen and disappointed; so much so, that it did
not escape the observation of the females, who, however, considered the
affairs of one so holy, unfit subjects for their prying curiosity.</p>

<p>It was the next day after his return from Eonee, that Thompson
addressed Gideon as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fraind Gaideon, Ai haave taaken counsel of the Loard
consairning the maatter whaich you spaake to me of soam daays saince,
aand it is boarne in upoan my maind thaat it maight be waal for us to

ais of a faiathful spairit coansaeleth the maatter.' Ai would knoaw,
thain, fraind Gaideon, if thou wouldest kaape my coaunsel as Ai do
thain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure I will,&rdquo; said Gideon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laif, even the laif of they fraind, will be in thy haands;
therefore, swair to me, as Eleazer swaare unto Aabaraham, thaat you wail
not, to any laiving soal, rapaet aany thaing thaat paasses betwaixt thai
and mai.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear,&rdquo; said Gideon, impatiently&mdash;&ldquo;say
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thompson looked wildly and cautiously around, to make sure that there
was no one in hearing.&mdash;&ldquo;Ai doa exsaedingly fair aand
traimble,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;laist soame aincoainsaideration of
thaine should betraay me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have said that you may trust me,&rdquo; said Gideon,
&ldquo;and surely that ought to satisfy you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With pale countenance and quivering lips Thompson
proceeded:&mdash;&ldquo;You haave saiad thaat you would becoame the
hausband of the Laittle Dair; knoast thou noat thaat, by thaat allaiance,
you would becoame immaidiately the chaif of the people of Tesumtoe, aand,

they caal themselves, the whole Chairokaa naation maight coam under your
control.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose,&rdquo; replied Gideon, &ldquo;that if I was
ignorant of all this, I should be so desirous for the match?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aind aif thaiy waishes could be aaccoamplished,&rdquo; said
Thompson, &ldquo;hoaw wouldest thou use thai power? Wouldst thou laid
foarth, aat the baidding of Coangraiss, thaiy waarriors, or wouldst thou
be wailling to resaive waalthe and honore from the majesty of Aingland,
and foallow hais coammaands?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; said Gideon, impetuously, &ldquo;this
is what Eoneguski meant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thompson started, like the toad mentioned in Milton's Paradise Lost,
when touched by the spear of Ithuriel.&mdash;&ldquo;Aionaguski daidst
thou saay?&mdash;Haas thaat chaif communicaated aany thaing whaich
paassed betwaixt haim and mai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied Gideon, &ldquo;but he told me to beware of
thee, and I now understand him.&mdash;A missionary, indeed!&mdash;Are not
the Creeks and other Indians, in different parts of the country, already
engaged in murdering the white settlers? and is it not to stir them up to
the same savage outrages, you have come amongst the Cherokees?&mdash;I
have heard of such people before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haave swoarn, aand Ai knoaw you wail not betraay
mai,&rdquo; said the frightened Thompson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not betray you,&rdquo; replied Gideon, &ldquo;but it is
upon the condition that the Little Deer is mine; and you may rest assured
that when the Cherokee nation comes under my control, it shall never make
war upon the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goad permitting, Ai wail use mai poar aindaivours in your
behaalf,&rdquo; said the humbled missionary, as they separated.</p>

<p>A few words are now necessary, according to the plan of our story, to
explain how Thompson came to appear in his present situation, over whose
fate uncertainty hung in the earlier part of our narrative. The Indians,
by whom he was taken at the same time with Robert Aymor, did not esteem
him much of a prize, and he accordingly fell into the hands of one of the
British emissaries, by whom he was taken to Canada. Here it is not
important what befell him until he joined the Methodist Church, and
passing through the intermediate grade of exhorter, finally became an
itinerant preacher.</p>

<p>The notorious affair of John Henry, during Mr. Madison's
administration, sufficiently discloses the practices resorted to, in no
degree creditable to the British name, by which the reduction of her
quondam colonies to their broken allegiance was sought to be effected.
Mr. Thompson's calling, together with the natural association produced by
the adventures of his early life, in which he had picked up something of
the Cherokee language, indicated him as one who might be advantageously
employed in the general plan of operations among the Cherokee Indians. It
is said that every man has his price, but, for the honor of human nature,
it is to be hoped this is rather the maxim of the cynic than of truth. At
any rate, the Rev. Mr. Thompson was not a high priced man. Besides, he
was not much accustomed to question the propriety of what had received
the sanction of high authority, and lent a willing ear to the very
advantageous proposals that were made him.</p>

<p>He passed through the United States, unquestioned, as an ordinary
itinerant preacher, and received all that kindness and respectful
attention his cloth is always so certain of commanding among all classes
of the Anglo-Americans. His journey was, therefore, upon the whole,
pleasant, until he found himself in the mountainous parts of North
Carolina. Although his native land, there was nothing there to bind to it
his affections&mdash;for his mother, as he had long since heard, fell
under the weight of her grief, upon learning his capture and
disappearance among the Indians. <i>There</i> came over him a feeling of
loneliness&mdash;his heart was ready to fail him; and he longed for some
stout companion, upon whose prowess he could rely in any difficulties
that might beset him. As he came into the vicinity of his old
acquaintance, Aymor, his recollection of the pusillanimous part he had
acted in their last interview, made him rather ashamed to encounter him,
and, besides, he somewhat feared the prying sagacity of the old whig. But
he learned that he was the father of a stout son, who had grown up with
an hereditary character for courage and perseverance, and Thompson was
determined to avail himself, if possible, of so suitable a
companion.&mdash;To time, and the great change in his habit, he trusted
for security against being recognised by his old sergeant. We have
already witnessed the result of his plan, and now, passing over
intermediate events, must pursue him to Eonee, where, in his private
interviews before mentioned with Eoneguski, he commenced upon that chief
the operation of stirring up the Cherokees against the white people.</p>

<p>He was altogether disappointed in the tone of mind manifested by the
chief on the subject of his communications, and, notwithstanding he
varied the attack on every occasion and in every form, and prolonged his
stay at Eonee to increase his opportunities, he had not the smallest
reason to flatter himself with the hope of success, when he departed for
Tesumtoe. The information there communicated by Gideon relative to the
Little Deer, opened to him a new field of speculation. He could appeal to
the love and jealousy of Eoneguski, and make the hand of the Little Deer
the price of the insurrection of the Cherokee tribe.</p>

<p>He accordingly made haste to Eonee, full of the plan, and confident of
its success; but when he arrived there, Eoneguski was from home, and he
learned such tidings respecting him, as blasted entirely his cherished
anticipations. Full of chagrin he returned to Tesumtoe, and resolved to
effect a part of his purpose, at least, in a different way, and to
bargain with Gideon for its accomplishment. His timid nature was entirely
unfit to encounter, in a negotiation, the bold though unprincipled temper
of Gideon, who, seeing at once his advantage, was determined to have
things at his own price, while it was in his power, rather than
unnecessarily involve himself in difficult and disgraceful stipulations.
Although foiled in his schemes hitherto, and having apparently
surrendered at discretion, Thompson was yet, at heart, determined to play
out his part with less boldness perhaps, but with more safety, and whilst
he lulled Gideon into confident security, watched the course of events,
ready to take advantage of any favorable occurrence.</p>

<p align="right">YAMOYDEN.</p>

<p>THE war of 1812, between England and the United States, is remembered
by both parties, even to this day, with something of bitterness. It is
probable that errors and misapprehensions on both sides led to this war,
and doubtless the same causes may have continued to keep alive the
feelings of unkindness with which it was necessarily attended. There is
no circumstance connected with it so hardly construed by the people of
the United States against the people of England, as their stirring up our
tawny neighbors, and our dark-skinned domestics, to harass, in the most
horrid of all forms of warfare, those who were allied to them by so many
of the most sacred ties. How far the nation of Great Britain may be
responsible for this outrage on humanity and civilized warfare, opinions
will differ; and while charity inclines, if possible, to exonerate it,
irresistible testimony fixes the stain indelibly upon many of the agents
of the Government.</p>

<p>Eoneguski had been for some time conscious that events were going on
in the political world, and that attempts were making calculated to
involve his people in hostilities with the whites, already commenced by
some of the neighboring tribes. He was not less conscious than other
superior men of his complexion, of the oppressions of the white people
upon the Indians, and of the iniquity of the principles which regulated
their intercourse with them. But he had also the sagacity to perceive it
was only through the forbearance of the whites that any thing was left to
the scattered red men; and that it was only tempting Fate, to throw
themselves out of the protection of the Government of the United
States&mdash;a very ineffectual one, truly&mdash;but, at the same time,
their only defence against the depredations of the border settlers. He
wisely believed it better contentedly to preserve the little that was
left them, than, by a hopeless attempt to improve their condition, expose
to certain destruction their present comforts. These opinions he had
early entertained, and taken great pains to propagate among the extensive
family of the red men.</p>

<p>The young chief paid to the Little Deer a visit just after Gideon's
departure on his return homeward, and had found her mind still unsettled;
so that nothing satisfactory could be learned as to the footing on which
they stood, and he had purposed renewing his visit immediately after the
celebration of the Green Corn Feast, at which his presence could not be
dispensed with by his people. But his interviews with Thompson convinced
him of the existence of a crisis at which his public duty was important
and urgent; and having taken great pains to put the Valley Indians upon
their guard, he set out, as soon as Gideon and Thompson had departed to
Tesumtoe, upon an expedition among the Overhill Cherokees, to counteract
any unfavorable influences that might be exercised among them.</p>

<p>It was during this absence that Thompson returned to Eonee, and
learning from Chuheluh, whom he had successfully assailed during his
first visit, the cause of Eoneguski's departure, he considered his chance
of doing any thing with him entirely hopeless. With the assistance of
Chuheluh, however, he experimented upon some few others, but was so much
disheartened as to abandon operations for the present in that region, and
return to Tesumtoe.</p>

<p>Eoneguski was gratified by the success he met with in quieting the
minds of the Cherokees, who had not entirely escaped exciting influences
artfully put in action, that, but for his timely interference, might very
speedily have kindled into a flame of hostility against the United
States, too fierce and raging to be extinguished.</p>

<p>He had scarcely reached home, felicitating himself on his success,
when, reposing at night in his wigwam, he felt some one shake him gently,
and whisper in a mandatory tone of voice, &ldquo;Eoneguski,
awake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surprised at so unexpected a salutation, under circumstances so
unusual, he sprang upon his feet, grasped his scalping-knife, and strove,
by the indistinct light, to discover who had thus intruded upon his
slumbers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chief of the Eonee,&rdquo; continued a soft, insinuating,
but manly voice, in the Indian tongue, and an under tone&mdash;&ldquo;is
in his own wigwam&mdash;surrounded by his own people;&mdash;he need fear
no danger.&mdash;It is the stranger that has come unbidden beneath his
roof, who has cause for apprehension.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stranger is always welcome to the home of Eoneguski,&rdquo;
replied the chief&mdash;&ldquo;He need fear nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My heart is a stranger to fear;&rdquo; replied the
unknown&mdash;&ldquo;but when my errand is over, I would go from the
wigwam unseen, as I came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall be as you say,&rdquo; replied the
chief&mdash;&ldquo;the people of Eonee are blind when their chief wills
not they should see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let not the chief of the Eonee use the tongue of the deceiver;"
replied the stranger&mdash;&ldquo;May I go unquestioned, even if my
speech should be displeasing to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chief of Eonee speaks but one language;&rdquo; was the
reply&mdash;&ldquo;his wigwam is the home of the stranger, and he may
come and go as it pleases him, as into the dwelling of his
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eoneguski now prepared to strike a light, but the stranger checked
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt not the faith of the Cherokee brave,&rdquo; he
said&mdash;&ldquo;but the business I am on requires haste, and may be
done in darkness, and I would not be seen when I leave the
wigwam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is enough;&rdquo; said Eoneguski&mdash;&ldquo;My ears are
open, let the stranger speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not speak to your ears only, but to your heart also;"
replied the stranger.&mdash;&ldquo;I would stir up the red blood that
warms it.&mdash;I would cause visions of glory to pass before
you.&mdash;I would invite you to the feast of Revenge, and make you drunk
with the blood of your enemies.&mdash;Hark! do you not hear the spirits
of your fathers calling aloud for vengeance?&mdash;See the widely
extended plains smoking with their blood, and whitening with their
bones!&mdash;Look around you, and behold the red men bending in slavery
beneath the pale faces!&mdash;Do you not feel the galling chains upon
your own limbs?&mdash;Do you not hear their distant clank as they are
borne along by your children for countless generations?&mdash;Are these
barren fields the only heritage left you by your fathers?&mdash;No!
ascend the highest peak of the Blue Mountains, and strain your eyesight
to its utmost, and still far beyond its reach the fruitful lands in broad
succession stretch themselves out a portion of your
birth-right.&mdash;And can the warrior sleep with fetters upon his limbs
while the harvest of Revenge is ripe, and ready to be
gathered?&mdash;when the Great Spirit calls him to snatch from the
spoiler his ravished birth-right?&mdash;For shame! for shame!&mdash;Shall
the daughter of Moytoy see the boundless empire of her father reduced by
the coward sons of the pale face to a space too narrow for the hunting
ground of a single Cherokee brave?&mdash;And will the son of Eonah calmly
look upon the wrongs of the maiden, in whose veins flows the noblest
blood of her tribe, and not make the hearts of her oppressors to quail at
his manly war-cry?&mdash;No! I see the red men flocking from every
quarter of the Heavens, like the countless wood pigeons.&mdash;The earth
is darkened, and echoes with the noise of their coming.&mdash;The hearts
of the pale faces are as the hearts of women before them;&mdash;and as
the fire devours the dry grass of the prairie as it sweeps over it, so
are the pale faces before the countless braves of the red men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surprise chained in silence the tongue of Eoneguski, as he at length
perceived by the dim light, the outline of a tall Indian warrior, in a
state of perfect nudity, who, not long preserving his low tone of voice,
had broken out into loud and rapid utterance, accompanied by wild and
violent gesticulation, and seemed some unearthly being amid the sombre
gloom by which he was surrounded, while his dark bright eyes scintillated
in the warmth of his declamation, like two luminous bodies.</p>

<p>The chief, availing himself of the first slackening of the bold stream
of eloquence&mdash;&ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Eoneguski is
not intoxicated by the excitement thou art pouring into his
soul.&mdash;He is not a fool, to mistake for a star of Heaven a meteor of
the evening.&mdash;He feels like thee, the wrongs of his people, and the
Great Spirit sees his heart, and knows it is no coward fear that
restrains him from action. But do not our fathers tell us, that many
hundred moons ago the red men were as countless as the stars, when the
pale faces crossed the great waters, as a feeble handful?&mdash;Did our
fathers then stand before them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; shouted the stranger, &ldquo;but our fathers were
then overcome, as their posterity have been ever since, not by manly
force&mdash;but by falsehood and guile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Eoneguski, &ldquo;the white men are now as
full of falsehood and guile as ever, and if they were too much for our
fathers, when they had the advantage of superior force, what have we to
hope for now, when the white men have become countless as the stars, and
the red men have dwindled to a handful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is of that I speak,&rdquo; replied the
stranger.&mdash;&ldquo;Let not the red men trust to the pale
faces.&mdash;The Great Spirit gave to the red man strength and activity,
as to the buffalo and the deer.&mdash;He gave him, like all his
creatures, capacity to endure the changes of season without any
covering.&mdash;The winds of Heaven pierced him, and the white snow came
upon his naked skin, and he knew no unmanly shivering.&mdash;The
scorching rays of the sun fell upon him, and he neither felt a blister
nor panted with thirst.&mdash;The earth produced him bread without
cultivation&mdash;and the woods and waters supplied him with
meat.&mdash;But the white skins came among the red men, and taught them
their effeminate customs, and made them their slaves.&mdash;Let the red
men return to the habits of their fathers.&mdash;Let them cast aside the
clothing which serves but to fetter the limbs of freemen.&mdash;Let them
drink the water as it falls from Heaven, unmingled with the intoxicating
poisons of the white men&mdash;and let their meat be the fish and the
game with which it supplies them.&mdash;Then may they defy the arts of
the pale faces, and retrieve the long lost possessions of their
fathers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The white men have in these things at least been the
benefactors of the red,&rdquo; replied Eoneguski, &ldquo;in that they
have taught them some of the comforts of civilized life. It were folly to
cast away the benefits we have derived from them, because they may have
wronged and oppressed us. But it would not be enough to part with all
these to enable us to make successful war with the whites. They need no
longer resort to guile:&mdash;they are too strong for us. As the brook
vainly encounters with its feeble current the broad stream of the river,
so would the red men be borne down by the superior force of the
whites.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither the guile nor the strength of the whites shall avail
them any thing,&rdquo; replied the stranger. &ldquo;The red men have
found in the white men, over the great waters, the enemies of their
oppressors, and they will strengthen the arms of their red
brothers&mdash;and they shall be victorious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And trust you,&rdquo; said Eoneguski, &ldquo;the weight of a
warrior upon a flimsy reed?&mdash;Will it not break under him, and pierce
his flesh when he leans upon it for support?&mdash;To whom think you will
your white allies give the fields which their strength and valor shall
assist you to conquer?&mdash;Think you the white men beyond the great
waters love their red brothers more than those of their own
blood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are but the instruments of the Great Spirit,&rdquo;
replied the stranger.&mdash;&ldquo;The elements of nature and the hearts
of men are alike in His hands, and He hath commanded the white skins of
England to assist their red brothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how are we to know that the hand of the Great Spirit is
with us?&rdquo; inquired the chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the stranger, again subduing his voice to a
whisper&mdash;&ldquo;Listen to the sign.&mdash;The pale faces have roamed
at large over this wide country, and in their pride have vainly thought
no place inaccessible to their accursed lust of territory and power. But
there is yet a spot which the Great Spirit hath preserved for his red
children only.&mdash;The foot of the pale face hath never yet intruded
upon its sacred precincts.&mdash;Some invisible power hath turned him
aside, whenever, in his wanderings, he hath happened to approach it. On
one side flows the Coosa, and on the other the Tallapoosa, bending like
the bow of a warrior, and uniting with the Coosa, almost encircles the
Holy Ground. There the tall and firm set hickory stands in thick
clusters, and sends up its leafy branches towards the blue
sky.&mdash;There, should every thing else fail us, the red men may
retreat and lie down in safety under the broad wing of the Great Spirit,
and not a pale face can come nigh to hurt us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; replied Eoneguski, &ldquo;this is but a
delusion. It is a dream that has visited my brother while he
slept.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dream!&rdquo; cried the astonished stranger.&mdash;&ldquo;A
dream!&mdash;Has the chief of Eonee never heard of a Prophet far away on
the great waters, which men call the Lakes?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard wonderful things of him,&rdquo; said
Eoneguski.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is my brother,&rdquo; replied the stranger. &ldquo;Our
mother gave to her nation three warriors at a birth; one of them is
Elkswattawa, the Prophet of the Lakes, and he hath sent me hither from
the frozen North, with a message from the Great Spirit to his red
children in this sunny land.&mdash;And I,&rdquo; continued the stranger,
elevating himself to his full dignified height, &ldquo;I am
Tecumseh.&rdquo; He paused&mdash;but there was no answer. &ldquo;Does my
brother,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;doubt the message of the Great
Spirit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eoneguski was no stranger to the fame of Tecumseh, and brave as he was
himself, could not repress a sense of inferiority, and a feeling of awe
in the presence of the great man who had dignified by his valor and
abilities the complexion he bore. These feelings were in no degree
diminished by the circumstances under which they met. It was the
stillness of midnight, and an inhabitant of a region countless miles
distant from Eonee, was standing before the Cherokee chief, in his own
wigwam. He had glided into it as noiselessly and imperceptibly as a
spirit, and might, if he had so desired, have slain its sleeping tenant,
without waking him from his slumbers.</p>

<p>But Eoneguski did not for a moment hesitate whether he should lend
himself to the schemes of the Shawnee chief. Yet he had no wish to incur
his displeasure, or be wanting in marks of that respect he really felt
for him. He was therefore quite at a loss so to frame his observations to
the now undisguised hero as that they might, without flattering his hopes
of obtaining a proselyte, manifest towards him his personal good
will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eoneguski is proud,&rdquo; he at length replied, &ldquo;to look
upon a warrior so renowned as Tecumseh, and feels that his wigwam is
honored by his presence.&mdash;But he may not consent to join with him in
taking the war-club against his great father at Washington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He that is not for us, is against us,&rdquo; said the Shawnee
chief, loudly and fiercely&mdash;&ldquo;When then Tecumseh and Eoneguski
meet again, it will be as enemies.&mdash;Some slight remains of weak
compassion would linger around the heart of Tecumseh when he saw a pale
face prostrate before him, begging for his life.&mdash;But for the
dastard red skin who had fought for her enemies, or had refused to lend
his arm in the struggles of his country, he would trample him in the
earth, and smile as he writhed beneath his tread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been deaf to your persuasions&mdash;and your threats are
not more effectual,&rdquo; replied Eoneguski.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; continued the Shawnee chief, contemptuously,
&ldquo;your degenerate love of the whites may be gratified by the
surrender of your guest.&mdash;Trust me, the scalp of Tecumseh would be
well paid for by your father at Washington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tempt me not too far,&rdquo; replied Eoneguski, &ldquo;lest the
world have cause to pronounce Tecumseh a fool, and Eoneguski a
villain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Heaven,&rdquo; said Tecumseh, approaching the Cherokee
chief, and raising the tomahawk he had all along held in his hand,
&ldquo;it would be well thus to terminate thy scruples.&rdquo; The bright
blade passed before the eyes of Eoneguski, but no quick drawing of the
breath, or hurried palpitation of the heart, indicated to Tecumseh that
he had stirred any emotion in the bosom of his host. &ldquo;You are
brave,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and Tecumseh would fain have such to battle
beside him in the cause of freedom. But he is a fool who spends his labor
in vain attempts to move the firm-rooted rock.&mdash;We met as
friends&mdash;from henceforth we are enemies.&mdash;Yet I hold you to
your pledge of hospitality, and claim to go as I came, unseen of any
one.&mdash;Eoneguski must not follow me, even with his eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, Tecumseh left the hut, and the scrupulous generosity of
Eoneguski restrained him from looking out to see whither he went.</p>

<p>The Eonee chief endeavored once more to compose himself to sleep, but
the exciting interview through which he had passed, long kept him
waking.</p>

<p>The next morning his mind reverted, as to a vision, to the events of
the night. He could not realize as a fact that he had holden actual
converse with the Northern warrior, of whom fame said so much. But the
doubts that lingered in his mind were fully removed by the stories told
by others, and the otherwise unaccountable absence of Chuheluh, and three
or four more of the inhabitants of the village, including his own slave
Mercury. The truth was, that not a wigwam in Eonee had been left
unvisited by the Shawnee chief between late bed-time and an hour or two
before day, and Eoneguski's was neither the first nor the last. With each
tenant he stipulated that he should not be watched, a stipulation easily
made, by appealing to the pride of hospitality, upon which all the savage
tribes greatly value themselves; and even Eoneguski did not suspect its
sole object to have been to enable the Shawnee chief to glide unseen into
other tenements. Tecumseh's first visit had been to Chuheluh, by whom he
was not unexpected, and from whom he received such hints, as to the
tenants of the respective wigwams, as enabled him to suit his style to
the characters of the persons he was addressing. But even with this
advantage his success was by no means flattering, and, finding himself
unable to raise the great mass of the town, the Northern warrior
determined to take with him, at once, to his rendezvous at Tookabatcha,
such individuals as were disposed to enlist their fortunes in the great
cause to which he had devoted himself.</p>

<p>He had already succeeded in stirring up the great body of the Creeks
and other Southern tribes, while his brother, the Prophet, was, with
equal success, infusing into the Northwestern hoards the sanguine hope
with which their own bosoms were filled, that, by a general revolt of the
whole Indian family, the race of Anglo-Americans would be entirely
extirpated, and the country restored to its ancient possessors.</p>

<p>The last attempt of Tecumseh had been with the Cherokees, and gliding
through the nation like a spirit, visible only to such as he desired
might see him, carefully sounded almost every individual. The last night
of this dangerous, bold and difficult mission was spent in Eonee, after
which he retraced his steps into what is now the State of Alabama, to his
head quarters at Tookabatcha. On his route thither he was joined,
according to previous concert, by such of the Cherokees as he had been
able to seduce from the general loyalty of the tribe to the United
States, scarcely exceeding in all forty or fifty, together with Mercury,
the slave of Eoneguski, who, apprehensive of punishment for some recent
villanies in which he had been detected, availed himself of this method
of escape.</p>

<p>At Tookabatcha, Tecumseh held a final consultation with his Southern
confederates, when it was arranged that Weatherford and the Little
Warrior, and others of inferior note, should conduct the military
operations of the Southern department, and that Monohoe should be the
great prophet of the South, as Elkswattawa was of the North.</p>

<p>Having completed these arrangements, this extraordinary being returned
northwardly, to fire the train previously laid, by which the whole United
States was to be kindled into war. But he was lead thither, by an
overruling Providence, to meet the fate prepared for himself, his
restless and ambitious brother, and hundreds of their hapless and deluded
followers;&mdash;to furnish, in his fall at the battle of the Thames, an
imperishable laurel for the brow of a gallant American, and to transmit
to him, as a <i>sobriquet,</i> the distinguished name
of&mdash;Tecumseh.</p>

<p align="right">CAMPBELL.</p>

<p>MEANTIME Thompson was carrying on his double operations in different
parts of the Cherokee country, but was much more successful in winning
many of the savages to the benign influence of the doctrines of the
Cross, than to the adoption of the cruel scheme of murdering their white
neighbors. His clerical duties kept him much from Tesumtoe, and thus
afforded him a reasonable excuse to Gideon for the very slow progress he
was making in his matters. But that impatient youth was not neglectful of
his own interests, notwithstanding the little encouragement he
received.</p>

<p>As for Eoneguski, the unsettled state of public affairs, and the vast
consequences involved in the present crisis, kept him, as a faithful
chieftain, constantly watchful over his people, lest some powerful
excitement might hurry them into acts of irremediable imprudence. No
concerns exclusively personal, however important, was, in his estimation,
a sufficient excuse at this time for a day's absence from his people, and
he was therefore continually passing among them, like a guardian spirit,
endeavoring to keep their minds in proper temper. But it was not many
weeks after the visit of Tecumseh, when tidings reached Eonee that the
Creeks had already commenced the work of destruction upon the white
settlements. Then did the native thirst for blood begin to manifest
itself among the savage charge of Eoneguski, in extreme restlessness and
neglect of the pursuits of peace. Already he began to fear his power of
restraining their bloody propensities was nearly exhausted, when it was
announced that their great father at Washington had called upon his red
children to fight for him.</p>

<p>The invited guests never flocked more joyously to a marriage banquet,
than did the people of Eonee rally around their chief, no longer
reluctant to lead them to battle. Fierce yells rang through the village,
and with frantic gesticulations, such as distinguished the ancient
Bacchanals, were they hourly running up and down the streets. The
infection spread throughout the Cherokee country, including Sugar Town
and Tesumtoe, and war-clubs and red sticks were paraded in every
direction.&mdash;But who was to lead the people of Tesumtoe? Their
hereditary chief was a female, and dangerous jealousies and bloodshed
were the usual fruits of an election.&mdash;Gideon had resolved to offer
himself as their leader, but one of the critical events to which Thompson
looked was now come. He was not a man to be unconscious of the danger of
his situation, but he trusted finally to Gideon's friendship as a sheet
anchor, to save him, should matters come to the worst. With fear and
trembling, he determined upon a last assault upon Eoneguski, and,
hastening to Eonee, represented to him his own influence with the Little
Deer, and the danger of her being lost to the chieftain without his
assistance, offering, at the same time, a positive assurance of success,
if he would yet change his side in the coming strife.</p>

<p>The chief did not turn upon him, as he had apprehended, with any
furious burst of anger, but elevating himself to his full height, and
fixing upon the trembling coward a look of disdain, pointed to the
sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Spirit,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;has marked for
him his path through the sky&mdash;onward he pursues it forever and
forever.&mdash;Such is Eoneguski.&mdash;Where the Great Spirit points the
way, thither he follows.&mdash;No frown shall terrify him; no smile shall
win him from his duty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, and without waiting for a reply from the astounded
missionary, he passed on.</p>

<p>Thompson now made his utmost speed back to Tesumtoe, resolving
seriously, as the only plan from which he had any thing to hope, to
strive his utmost to bring about the marriage between Gideon and the
Little Deer; and to make sure of taking one, at least, from the strength
of the American army, he represented to Gideon the advantage he might
derive in his suit, by remaining behind and urging it, while Eoneguski
was absent engaged in battle. The idea seemed plausible, and Gideon
adopted it, declining to offer himself as a leader to the people of
Tesumtoe, who finally united their forces with those of Eoneguski. Their
example was followed by the people of Sugar Town, whose aged chief,
Santuchee, was unfitted by infirmity for the fatigues of the
campaign.</p>

<p>These circumstances placed under the command of Eoneguski more than
three hundred warriors. With these he set out upon his march, being
joined by the respective parties as he passed by Sugar Town and Tesumtoe,
on his way to the Great Look-Out Mountain, which, like the Pilot or
Ararat, has been, from time immemorial, one of the objects by which the
Indians guide themselves in their wanderings. Following the eastern base
of this mountain, and passing by several others towns, Eoneguski came to
Canuhtown, one of the southern frontier villages of his nation, where the
Pathkiller, one of the oldest chiefs of the Overhill Cherokees, had
already established himself with a considerable force, with which
Eoneguski united his own.</p>

<p>They had not been long in this position when they learned from their
scouts, that the Creeks, and other hostile tribes, were flocking like
pigeons to their roost, to a place not very distant, in numbers
sufficient to overwhelm them. The Pathkiller, whose name is indicative of
his speed, as well as his great power of endurance, immediately flew in
person to the American General to inform him of the danger that
threatened his allies, entrusting the command to Eoneguski during his
absence. The Pathkiller soon returned with sufficient reinforcements, and
several bloody battles were fought in quick succession, in which, while
Eoneguski distinguished himself as among the bravest and most skilful
warriors, the result gave him no reason to doubt the correctness of his
judgment, or regret his determination in the choice of his party.</p>

<p>Amidst multiplied disadvantages, and under the most unfavorable
circumstances, did the genius and bravery of the American
Commander-in-chief, time after time, snatch victory from the very grasp
of his enemies. So numerous and decided were the defeats experienced at
his hands by the hostile savages, that they were at length induced
superstitiously to believe that in the person of Andrew Jackson, General
Anthony Wayne, the hero of the third part of a century past, had verified
his threat of rising from the dead, and coming to chastise their
insolence and misguided rebellion against the United States. Still they
maintained their confidence in Monohoe, who continued to prophesy to them
smooth things, and, in the face of repeated defeats, to promise them
ultimate success. Incantations, like those of the Saga at Sugar Town,
were continually practised by him to impose upon the superstitious
credulity of his deluded followers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Holy Ground,&rdquo; he would tell them&mdash;&ldquo;still
remains unprofaned by the foot of a white man, and in their final stand
on that sacred spot, the Great Spirit, if not before, will work out for
his red children a miraculous deliverance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After several months fighting, with some few and very short intervals
of comparative repose, the infatuated savages began to gather towards the
ark of promised safety, panting for rest to their war-tost spirits. But,
like the desperate gamester, who flatters himself there is a magical
virtue in his last piece of coin, and trembles for the moment when he
must put it up, and witness the gratifying fulfilment of his
expectations, or the final wreck of his hopes, so did the disheartened
savages cast a wistful eye of trembling confidence towards the Holy
Ground, yet hesitated to take there their final stand; preferring the
light of a sickly hope to the gloom of despair.</p>

<p>The Tallapoosa River, just above the place recognised by the Indians
as the Holy Ground, makes a most extraordinary bend, forming a striking
resemblance to a large horse-shoe, called, in their language, Tohopeka.
This peninsula, if cannon and boats were excluded from the attack, was
assailable but at one narrow point, where it joined the main land by an
isthmus not more than three hundred yards in width. It caught the eye of
the savages as the place where the predictions of their prophets were to
be fulfilled;&mdash;and where they might make their immoveable stand, and
exclude the whites forever from the Holy Ground. With a skill not looked
for in savages, but which these had learned by severe experience, they
fortified this narrow neck of land against the approach of an enemy. The
lofty timber with which the isthmus was covered, they cut down, one tree
upon another, through the openings in which they were enabled to make a
well-directed fire upon an assailing foe, while a thick covert was
provided for themselves against the shot of an enemy. With prudent
foresight they further provided, in case of the worst, a means of retreat
in their canoes, which were arranged in great numbers around the
peninsula.</p>

<p>With these preparations, the Southern limb of that great army of red
men, which had been called into being mainly by the restless and
ambitious genius of a single individual, awaited, with desperate courage,
the expected attack. Hitherto the Americans, in their numerous victories,
had only scotched the snake, not killed it; now their insidious enemy
had, as it were, coiled himself for his last desperate spring, and the
opportunity was presented to crush him forever.</p>

<p>Not long was the trial of patience to which the Indians were
subjected. They had scarcely completed their arrangements, when the tall,
gaunt form of General Jackson appeared in the distance, mounted on a
superb charger, at the head of a mingled force of whites and savages.
With the stroke of his sagacious eye, the American General at once saw
the advantages of the position occupied by the enemy, and comprehended
the best means of counteracting them. An elevation in the ground, at the
most suitable distance for the action of the few pieces of small
artillery in the service, was selected, and his battery erected upon it.
He perceived the arrangements made for escape, in case the foe should
find themselves unable to maintain their strong position, and
deliberated, for an instant, whether it would be better to leave them
this coward hope, by which the desperation of their resistance would be
diminished, or, by removing it, force upon them the alternatives of
death, conquest, or submission&mdash;and thus, by increasing the hazard
of success, render it more effectual, if obtained. He determined upon the
latter course, and to that end despatched Eoneguski with his command with
instructions, while the attention of the hostile Indians was occupied in
the defence of their breastwork, to swim unperceived to their canoes, and
bring them away. To cut off every hope of retreat, a party was sent to
the opposite side of the river to intercept any who might have the
hardihood to attempt escape by swimming.</p>

<p>These arrangements being completed, the deep-mouthed cannon began to
pour upon the breastwork their destructive contents; while the gallant
Montgomery, at the head of his detachment, advanced to the charge. The
leaden hail from the rifles of the savages, fell thickly upon this
devoted party, but they pressed forward, to make a lodgment within the
enemy's works. The first to place his footsteps upon the unsure footing
afforded by the interwoven boughs of the inartificial breastwork, was
Montgomery himself; but scarcely was his plume seen to rise aloft, when
it fell, stained with the blood pouring from a mortal wound in his head.
Another and another followed their intrepid leader, but to share with him
death and glory.</p>

<p>A desire to avenge their comrades, now added to the incentives of
those who were behind to rush onwards, and presently a living multitude
was making its way over the trunks and branches of trees, against the
slackened fire of their adversaries. Among the foremost of these was a
tall, sinewy man, on whom time had left many distinct traces, but had not
extinguished the fire of his eye, nor much abated his strength,
originally great. He was the first to make a leap from the breastwork,
but his foot becoming entangled among the branches of a tree, he fell
within the enemy's works. Instantly the fingers of a savage were twisted
in his grey hair, and the tomahawk was uplifted to dash into his brain.
The yell of the savage, as he prepared to strike, was answered by a
correspondent one immediately above him, which, for an instant, arrested
his attention; when, as quick as thought, a man precipitated himself from
the breastwork, and received into his shoulder the tomahawk destined for
the head of his prostrate comrade. The shock disengaged the hand of the
savage from the hair of the veteran, who, springing upon his feet, in
turn saved his deliverer from farther injury, by laying the Indian dead
with a blow of his musket.</p>

<p>A moment's freedom from immediate danger enabled the two recently
united in imminent peril to recognise each other, and &ldquo;Mr.
Aymor,&rdquo; escaped from one lip, while &ldquo;John Welch,&rdquo; was
uttered in almost breathless surprise, by the other. But there was no
time for conversation, the blood was pouring from the wounded shoulder of
Welch in a rapid stream, and already objects began to swim around him. He
fell, and no ties of friendship were at such a crisis sufficient to
divert a soldier from the onward path of duty. The Americans had now
gained in considerable numbers a footing on the inner side of the
breastwork, and were driving back the savage force towards the river.
Duty and inclination both called upon Aymor to add his bayonet to the
wall of bristling steel, gradually enclosing the foe in a narrower
circle. He left Welch weltering in his blood, and, as he believed, never
to rise again.</p>

<p>Meantime Eoneguski and his party had glided down to the river on each
side of the Horseshoe, and like so many water-moccasins, dropped into the
stream. No sensible agitation of the water indicated the advance of these
expert swimmers, who, while the hostile Indians were occupied in the
defence of their breastwork, entirely unperceived bore off every canoe,
and placed it where it could be commanded by the fire of the American
artillery.</p>

<p>This task being completed, the Cherokee chief followed the track
marked by the slain, and sprung into the works just in time to sustain
the Americans, as the enemy, having retreated to the river, and finding
their canoes gone, had rallied in desperation, and roled back the tide of
battle upon their pursuers. A deadly fire poured in upon the adversaries
by Eoneguski and his party, forced them to recoil, and regained the
doubtful advantage.</p>

<p>As yet the foe maintained themselves in numbers upon another part of
the works, where their courage and enthusiasm were sustained by Monohoe,
the prophet, who, in the face of the American artillery, most grotesquely
dressed, was practising his incantations, and giving to his followers
confident assurances of victory. Ever and anon as a cannon-ball severed a
bough on which he stood, he would entirely disappear, to the dismay of
those who trusted in his Divine mission, but rising unhurt, or concealing
his injuries, with a triumphant yell he would boldly resume a conspicuous
position. Sometimes he would spread forth his hands with shouts of
defiance towards the Americans, and then leap from bough to bough, with
the activity of a squirrel, and thus by the most fearless exposure of his
person, give the strongest assurance of his own confidence in the sacred
character to which he pretended.</p>

<p>Among the Cherokees who were fighting for the United States, was one
who, on account of having accidentally appropriated to himself the
cast-off boots of one of the officers, was known in the army by the
nickname of &ldquo;Shoe-Boots.&rdquo; But in the fanciful spirit which
seems to direct that people in their choice of names, he had assumed for
himself that of the &ldquo;Game Cock.&rdquo; He laid claim to the
extravagant bravery of that bird, and had made himself quite expert in
the imitation of his crowing; besides this he garnished the upper part of
his person with feathers, and was in truth one of those light-hearted
persons who are constantly cheerful, and meet danger with indifference,
because they seem to be unconscious of its existence. Shoe-Boots, (or the
Game Cock,) formed a part of the corps of reserve, and was quite restless
under the inactivity to which he was doomed. Observing at a distance the
astonishing boldness and good fortune of Monohoe, he remarked to an
officer standing near him, that, with a single fire of his rifle, he
could put an end to the strife. &ldquo;Let me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but
bore with a bullet the false tongue of Monohoe, and those dogs who trust
in him will fight no longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer, but greatly tickled with his own idea,
Shoe-Boots ran off in the direction of the subject of his remarks,
regardless of the shower of bullets falling around him, until he came
within &ldquo;point blanc&rdquo; shot of Monohoe, when he stopped, and
elevating his rifle, took deliberate aim at the mouth of the prophet. The
bullet, true to the mark, took effect, and Monohoe fell, to the horror of
those fighting by his side.</p>

<p>Had Shoe-Boots been contented with his exploit, and immediately
retreated, all might have been well. But perceiving his success, and
proud of his achievement, he struck his arms against his side, in
imitation of the flapping of a chicken's wings, and crowed oft and
loudly. But his triumph was exceedingly brief, for the savages, although
disheartened, were also enraged at the fall of their prophet, and made
one general and deadly discharge of their rifles, and retreated from
their breastworks. Like the ancient Parthians, their retreating fire was
not the least destructive, and Shoe-Boots was among its victims; and,
like the nervous Judge of Israel, the intrepid Indian found triumph and
death in the same instant. As Shoe-Boots had foreseen, the hopes of the
enemy expired with Monohoe, and nothing like regular resistance was
longer maintained. Still they asked no quarters, but from the thick
coverts within which they were enabled to conceal themselves, stragglers
continued to annoy the American army.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-chief, now humanely anxious to prevent farther
carnage on either side, desired to communicate to the enemy under a flag
of truce his benevolent purposes. But in the present temper of the
savages there was little reason to hope that respect would be accorded to
that sacred symbol in civilized warfare, and the post of its bearer would
be one of extreme danger. Eoneguski removed all difficulty by offering
himself to the task&mdash;was accepted, and proceeded on his hazardous
errand. Aymor with others kept within such distance that they might
render aid if necessary. Eoneguski had just proclaimed in a loud voice,
and in the Indian tongue, the message of mercy, when Aymor discovered an
old Indian thrusting out his gun from an ambuscade, and levelling it at
the speaker. Instantly his own was directed against the head of the sly
savage, who was too intently engaged in his object to perceive him. With
haste Aymor drew the trigger, and anticipated the deadly purpose of the
assailant. The convulsive grasp of death discharged the rifle of the
purposed assassin, but his bullet flew aimless. Eoneguski and Aymor had
only time to discover at the same moment that it was their old enemy
Chuheluh, to whom Heaven had awarded the just fate of perishing by his
own devices, when numberless bullets, flying in that direction, one of
which slightly wounded Eoneguski in the breast, convinced them that their
post was hardly tenable. The unequal contest was now resumed, in which
the hope-forsaken savages seemed to court destruction, and it is probable
they would have been in this gratified to a man, had not night spread
over them her mantle of protection.</p>

<p>Aymor repaired to the spot where he left Welch, whom, beyond his most
sanguine hope, he found still breathing, but utterly insensible. With the
aid of friends he conveyed him to the hospital of the American army, and
put him in the reach of surgical assistance. He obtained permission to be
with him while the army remained stationary, and had the satisfaction of
finding the efforts of the surgeon soon successful in restoring him to
sensation. The promise of recovery quickly succeeded, and before Aymor
was forced to leave him mutual explanations had taken place between them,
in which it appeared that Welch had, since his last interview with Atha,
led the life of an unhappy wanderer, at a loss what to do until he
encountered the army of General Jackson, with which he had united
himself, partly from patriotism, and partly to find excitement for a
depressed mind. For Aymor's part, as soon as the Indian war had fairly
broken out, he found his old military passion returning, and with his
former rank of sergeant, entered General Graham's corps as a volunteer.
This corps had not yet united with the Southern army, but Aymor had been
sent to reconnoitre, and had fallen in with General Jackson just in time
for the battle of Tohopeka.</p>

<p>It was agreed that as soon as Welch was recovered, he should repair to
Aymor's residence, on the Homony, and in the mean time Aymor should keep
to himself the knowledge of his existence, lest it might not be well
received by some of the Indians present, and farther lest as his recovery
was yet doubtful, hope might be excited in the minds of those dear to
him, only to render their disappointment the more severe. The latter
consideration acquired additional consequence from what Aymor told Welch
of the existence of his mother, and the harassing state of hope and fear
in which she had so long been kept concerning him. After these
explanations the two friends were compelled to separate, Aymor leaving
Welch with the rest of the wounded, while he himself went on with the
army in the fulfilment of his duties as a soldier.</p>

<p align="right">YAMOYDEN.</p>

<p>TO an opinion once deliberately formed the mind clings with the grasp
of death, and the tenacity with which it is holden is generally in a
ratio with its opposition to reason. The cause probably is, that such
opinions are originally adopted merely because they are agreeable, and
being so, their identity with truth is not much examined. They are chosen
by the mind, as it were, from affection, and not of right, and some
passion, always more sensitive than the understanding, would be violated
in their surrender. There is nothing more deplorably wretched and naked
than the human mind, when stripped of some comfortable robe of opinion,
in which she has seen fit to array herself, stolen by falsehood from
truth, and officiously lent her. Overwhelmed with shame, she droops into
inactivity, and scarcely makes an effort to seek for more substantial and
tenable clothing. Or, to drop the figure, when some reliance for security
from danger, which has been looked to with confidence, proves, at the
crisis, entirely unavailing, a person is prone to give up in despair,
instead of striving to obtain some better dependance.</p>

<p>It is in a contrary course of conduct that elevated minds are
distinguished from the vulgar, and that courage and genius make their
most striking displays. The credulous hope entertained by the hostile
savages, that there was a magic virtue in the Holy Ground, which had not
been tested, was now generally known among the Americans, and had not
escaped the ears of the Commander-in-chief. Rumor also said, a few days
after their signal defeat at the Horseshoe, that they were already
embodied in this fortress of their strength, with a determination to
succeed, or re-enact, with increased ferocity, the scenes of Tohopeka.
Thither the American General resolved immediately to pursue them, and
follow up the blow he had just given, before they had time to recover
from its stunning influence. With this view, as soon as arrangements
could be made suitable to the decisive character of the movement, he took
up his march for the Holy Ground.</p>

<p>The dauntless Weatherford, the brave brave but unsuccessful hero of so
many battles, strove in vain to infuse his own confident spirit into such
of his compatriots as were left after their defeat at Tohopeka. But the
voice of Monohoe was wanting, to wake, with its mystic spell, their
languishing hopes, by dispensing imaginary promises from Heaven, with a
jugglery that defied detection. Nor was it merely that his voice was
wanting to summon up their blood, but, like the primitive Christians,
they were laboring under that depression which necessarily followed the
beholding him, to whom they had implicitly trusted as their Saviour,
dying like a common man, and consigned to corruption. The shepherd had
been smitten, and the sheep were consequently scattered in dismay. With
Monohoe fell the confidence of those who had heretofore believed in his
promises and predictions, and at the same time was their faith shaken in
the mystic security of the Holy Ground.</p>

<p>The efforts of Weatherford were ineffectual to rally there a number of
followers sufficient, by their natural force, to make even a show of
resistance. But one hope, therefore, remained, and even his masculine
mind became disposed to cling to it, as the drowning mariner seizes upon
the slightest object floating upon the surface of the great deep, in the
desperate trust that it may possibly prove the means of his
deliverance.</p>

<p>The last hope of Weatherford and his followers was, that their
prophets might not after all be lying prophets, and that the Great Spirit
would, indeed, by his Almighty power, retain for his red children the
exclusive possession of the Holy Ground. He therefore gathered around him
the small group that remained of the countless force, with which he had,
a few months before, gone forth to battle, to watch with composure the
result&mdash;to witness with triumph some signal destruction of their
enemies, as soon as they should place their unhallowed feet upon the
consecrated ground&mdash;or yield themselves, with calm resignation, to
resistless power&mdash;resolved to encounter, with unshrinking fortitude,
any tortures to which vengeance might subject them. The experiment,
pregnant with the fate of themselves and posterity, was now to be
made.</p>

<p>All that could be done, in their own strength, had been already tried
by the red people, to reclaim the dominion their ancestors had, for moons
without number, maintained over the boundless continent, and bequeathed
to them. Their efforts had been worse than fruitless, and unless an
Almighty power now wrought for them, the empire of the whites must be
established forever. That the destruction of the whites might be as
general and effectual as possible, Weatherford and his party took their
stand on the southern extremity of the Holy Ground, that, in the pursuit,
the whole American army might be decoyed, like an entire flock of birds,
into a vast net.</p>

<p>Meantime the American General pressed on with his victorious army,
anticipating a last conflict, more severe than all that had preceded it.
With that characteristic foresight which so happily mingled with his
natural boldness of temper, he was ever on the <i>qui vive</i> against an
ambuscade, the favorite artifice of savage warfare. But all was stillness
and desolation as he passed along, as if some destructive blast had swept
before him on his path, and borne a way every hostile creature, as the
dried leaves are carried by the winds of autumn. The villages were
tenantless, and not an unfriendly Indian of any age or sex was
visible.</p>

<p>The army of the United States entered the mysterious covert of the
sacred woods&mdash;their unhallowed feet were pressing upon the mystic
soil&mdash;and yet the Heavens were calm above them&mdash;nor did the
indignant earth open to receive them. No angry cloud muttered its
thunders&mdash;nor did any sudden quaking of nature indicate the presence
of an avenging Deity. Onward the army passed over the rich unctuous
ground, and beneath the massy branches of those time-rooted hickories,
that had waved for ages unseen by the eye of a single white man&mdash;and
yet not a red skin was found in this sanctuary of their hopes.</p>

<p>The savages at length beheld their advance; they perceived that the
whole American army was within the sacred precincts, and in a few moments
more would have traversed its whole extent. The smile with which Hope had
continued to cheer them was now suddenly withdrawn, and they contemplated
in sadness the last wave of her pinion, as she flew forever from he
sacred grove, of which she had been so long and so constantly a
tenant.</p>

<p>The savages in their turn, became visible to their enemies, and, as
quick as thought, the American army was in order of battle, and making
preparations for a desperate conflict. Courage and fear were stirring the
hearts of the brave and the timid, in the immediate prospect of a bloody
strife, when a single Indian warrior was seen advancing towards the
American Commander-in-chief, from the hostile ranks, with slow but
resolute steps. No weapon was in his hand, save an unstrung bow, which,
with down cast eyes, he seemed contemplating as he moved along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Weatherford,&rdquo; he said, as he approached the
General.&mdash;&ldquo;I am in your power; do with me as you
please.&mdash;I am a soldier.&mdash;I have done to your nation all the
harm that I could.&mdash;I have fought them, and fought them
bravely.&mdash;If I had an army, I would fight them still.&mdash;I am the
last among my people to say we will fight no longer.&mdash;But I have no
army.&mdash;My people are all gone.&mdash;Nothing is left to me but to
weep over the misfortunes of my nation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Struck with the noble bearing of the speaker, the boldness and force,
yet deep pathos, of his remarks, the General replied&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not ask you to lay down your arms.&mdash;The United States
does not solicit you for peace.&mdash;But the terms on which your nation
can be saved have been already disclosed to you.&mdash;Upon these, and no
other, can peace be granted.&mdash;But if it is your wish to continue the
war, no advantage shall be taken of you.&mdash;Although in my power, you
may yet go free&mdash;you are at liberty to join the war party.&mdash;But
remember, if hereafter you are taken in arms, you will have forfeited
your life.&mdash;If you really desire peace, remain where you are, and
you shall be protected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you may well address me thus;&rdquo; replied the undaunted
warrior&mdash;&ldquo;there was a time when I had a choice, and could have
answered you.&mdash;I have none now.&mdash;Even hope has ended.&mdash;Our
grain and cattle are all wasted and destroyed, and our women and children
are perishing with hunger.&mdash;Once I could animate my warriors to
battle, but I cannot animate the dead.&mdash;My warriors can no longer
hear my voice&mdash;their bones are at Talledega, Tallushatchee, Emucfaw,
and Tohopeka.&mdash;Weatherford comes not thus unarmed without
reflection.&mdash;While hope remained, I never left my post, or
supplicated peace.&mdash;But my people are gone, and I now ask it for my
nation and for myself.&mdash;You are a brave man&mdash;I rely on your
generosity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Weatherford's submission, whose example was followed by all that
remained of the hostile tribes, except a few who retreated to the wilds
of Florida, the war was ended, and a treaty having been entered into, by
which the boundary lines of the several tribes of Indians were settled,
Eoneguski and the rest of the disbanded followers of General Jackson,
returned to their respective homes.</p>

<p>In the conditions of the treaty Eoneguski was desirous that the noble
stream having its source in the State of South Carolina, passing through
a corner of North Carolina, cutting, for a considerable extent, three
other large States, and finally losing itself in the great Ohio River,
should, with the lands lying along it, be acknowledged as the property of
his tribe. This claim was founded upon an alleged ancient possession, in
proof of which tradition was referred to, as well as the name of the
stream itself, being the Cherokee or Tennessee River. But Eoneguski was
compelled to acquiesce in terms much less advantageous. Through the
valley of this great stream had been the path of Tecumseh, in his late
fatal visit to the Southern tribes of Indians, and the great politician,
as well as warrior, of the United States, negotiating with his yet
unsheathed sword, dripping with hostile blood, declared that a
communication so dangerously inviting between the Northern and Southern
Indians, must be closed forever. From his flat there was no appeal, and
the treaty was concluded upon the terms he prescribed. His was a spirit
destined to impress its genius upon the times in which he lived, and
control, by its force, the current of events. By its association with
him, a tree before unknown in story, has usurped the place of the laurel,
and the Hickory, which abounded in one of the scenes of his numerous
military triumphs, has become consecrated to Fame. He has, in his
extraordinary career, made it alike the badge of martial glory and of
civic honor&mdash;and his death is destined to give it yet farther
dignity, and render its leaf emblematic of an imperishable name.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_24">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h3>

<p><br>
                          Had she been true&mdash;<br>
                          If Heaven would make me such another world,<br>
                          Of one entire and perfect chrysolite&mdash;<br>
                          I'd not have sold her for it.</p>

<p align="right">SHAKSPEARE.</p>

<p>IT is in the approving smile of woman that the warrior of all
complexions, and all ages, has sought the reward of his toils, dangers,
and self-denials. At the feet of a mother, a sister, a wife, or a
mistress, are laid his blood-stained laurels, to wither or to flourish,
as she may determine.</p>

<p>Towards Tesumtoe, then, on his way homeward, did the heart of
Eoneguski turn with hope and fear, both awakened to increased intensity.
&ldquo;She will no longer despise me as a coward,&rdquo; he said to
himself&mdash;&ldquo;and will rejoice that my hand is not stained with
the blood of John Welch, when she learns that he is her own
kinsman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Months had now elapsed since unexplained scruples had ruffled the even
current of his wooing, and he trembled to learn that they had been
confirmed or abandoned. His generous nature had never for a moment
attached suspicion to Gideon, neither had his worst fears pointed to the
danger of a rival. Doubly severe, then, was his trial, when, arriving at
Tesumtoe, he learned that the Little Deer had not only resolved to
extinguish his hopes, but had actually become the wife of his treacherous
friend. The influence gained over her by Thompson had been successfully
used for inflaming the objections of prudence and religion to her union
with Eoneguski, and exalting into duty and necessity an alliance with
Gideon.</p>

<p>Availing themselves of the first moment of weakness, the ungenerous
lover and the unprincipled priest, had riveted upon their victim a chain
which nothing but death could sever. Thompson married them, according to
the formulary of that church of which he was a priest, and the bride a
member. Yenacona was induced, by a number of considerations, reluctantly
to witness a rite which held, in her estimation, the rank of a sacrament,
performed by one whose divine authority she could not fully
recognise.</p>

<p>It was not long after the solemnization of these nuptials, that
intelligence reached Tesumtoe of the total overthrow of the hostile
savages, and Thompson conceiving his situation no longer safe, made a
precipitate retreat from the Indian nation, leaving Gideon to manage his
affairs in the best way he could. From thenceforth obscurity again rested
upon the fate of the missionary&mdash;he was never more heard of, and it
is not impossible that, like many other cowards, he ran into the grasp of
danger in his very endeavor to flee from it&mdash;that he perished in
some of the mountain wilds by the hand of some straggling Indian, moved
by covetousness, or perhaps revenge, as the friend of Eoneguski, for the
part Thompson was supposed to have taken in causing his disappointment
with the Little Deer.</p>

<p>Language cannot describe the stunning effect upon the Indian chief of
learning the total wreck of his hopes; the annihilation of what had been
to him, as an individual, for so long a time, the mainspring of action.
But no exclamation escaped him&mdash;silent and downcast he pursued his
way homeward, like one disgraced and discomfited; and not as a victor
bearing on his brow the wreath of triumph. Violent was the inward
struggle, yet faint were its outward indications upon his placid
countenance. Dark thoughts of vengeance at times crowded themselves upon
his soul, and the false heart of Gideon already, in his fancy, quivered
in agony, as its dark recesses were searched by the blade of his
scalping-knife. But better thoughts, the inborn offspring of his own
noble spirit, rose indignant, and chased away these base intruders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said, internally&mdash;&ldquo;Gideon is the son
of Robert Aymor, the friend of Eonah, the benefactor of
Eoneguski&mdash;but for Robert Aymor the false Chuheluh had laid
Eoneguski low at Tohopeka.&mdash;Did Robert Aymor save the life of
Eoneguski that he might slay his son?&mdash;No! rather let Eoneguski die,
and let Gideon live and be happy.&mdash;And is not Gideon young?&rdquo;
he continued&mdash;&ldquo;and did he come unasked to look upon the beauty
of the Little Deer?&mdash;Why did Eoneguski bring Gideon from the Homony
to gaze upon the beauty of the Little Deer, and forget his friend in the
madness of intoxication?&rdquo; And then would his mind turn with
crimination upon the Little Deer; and, like other unfortunate lovers, the
falsehood and duplicity of the sex became fruitful themes for bitter
reflection. The revengeful wish was now and then half formed that her
union might prove unhappy, and that stung with disappointment, the
inconstant beauty might have reason vainly to repine at her unwise
selection. But honest shame for the weakness would strangle in the birth
the ungenerous sentiment. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; would he murmur to
himself&mdash;&ldquo;let her live, and be as happy as her fathers in the
land of the blessed.&mdash;May her corn be abundant&mdash;her table ever
spread with game and venison.&mdash;May the sun always be bright in her
sky, and may her husband cherish her forever with a love as strong and
durable as would have been that of Eoneguski.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such were the thoughts which, in the first transports of
disappointment, agitated the bosom of the Cherokee chief; but he soon
began to look with more calmness upon his destiny, resolving to lead a
life of celibacy, and fix the paternal feelings of his bosom, thus
forever cut off from their natural objects, upon the whole people of
Eonee, and hold them as the extensive family of his affection.</p>

<p>But he was not long suffered to enjoy, unmolested, this new dream of
mitigated happiness and philosophic content. Scarcely had the treaty been
signed which ascertained the territorial rights of the Cherokee Indians,
when the covetous eyes of the neighboring white people were fixed upon
the fairest portion of their possessions, and commissioners were
appointed to negotiate for a purchase. The sad experience of past times
filled Eoneguski with the most painful forebodings of the result. To
negotiate had been, in the history of the intercourse between the white
and the red men, but a term to express less harshly a declaration, on the
part of the former what lands they wanted of the latter; the price they
were willing to pay; and their determination to have them at that price,
&ldquo;peaceably if they could, forcibly if they must.&rdquo; The village
of his birth; the scene of his early sports; of his youthful affections;
of his manly trials; the hearthstone; the tombs; the ashes of his
fathers; were all included in the present demand. With a prophetic eye he
saw them already surrendered to the relentless grasp of the stranger, and
the simple red men abandoning, in bitterness of soul, the homes of their
fathers, which they ardently desired, but wanted the sagacity to
retain.</p>

<p>But the Eonee chief determined not to surrender, without an effort of
peaceful opposition, these dear possessions, and accordingly passed with
rapid and unwearied footsteps from one portion to another of the Cherokee
country, entreating and urging the leading men of his tribe, by the most
thrilling appeals, and the most convincing arguments, not to consent to
the sale of their territory. He had the mortification, though not
unexpected by him, of finding himself, in many instances, already
forestalled, and that the personal advantages promised to some of the
chiefs had blinded their eyes to official duty, and to the interests of
those for whom they were acting as representatives. His mortification
was, however, not unmingled with satisfaction, at ascertaining that a
great number entered warmly into his views and feelings, and there was a
flattering probability that, in the council to be holden relative to the
measure, his own party might prove the stronger.</p>

<p>Gideon Aymor, by his marriage with the Little Deer, had acquired a
voice potential, both as the immediate chief of Tesumtoe, and also as
being, by alliance, the representative of the Cherokee kings, and
consequently presiding chief of the nation. A white man, in all his
prejudices and feelings, and destitute of any local attachments to spots
sacred in the eyes of the whole Cherokee tribe, he was easily operated
upon, by a considerable pecuniary advantage, personal to himself, to
throw his whole weight in favor of the sale.</p>

<p>Eoneguski and Gideon were thus fully arrayed against each other, as
the leaders of their respective parties. The irritation of their late
rivalry in love had, it might be supposed, scarcely yet subsided, when
they were thus chafed into open personal strife by their political
relations. Each was indefatigable in enlisting partisans, in anticipation
of the council that was to determine whether the ground on which their
contest was chiefly maintained was to be alienated, or remain the
property of its aboriginal possessors. They frequently met, and their
strife occasionally grew so warm as to threaten an immediate and bloody
issue.</p>

<p>The eventful day at length arrived, and with it the commissioners of
the United States, at Eonee. They spent the greater part of it in
submitting their proposals to the assembled chiefs, and operating upon
the hopes, the fears, the ambition, and avarice of the respective members
of the council, according as they were most assailable. The night was
dark and cloudy, but the council fires were lighted, and the grave
leaders of the Cherokee nation were seated around them to debate the
important question. Long and heated was the debate, and, at a late hour
in the night, the party of Gideon prevailed, by a small majority. No
expression of dissatisfaction or disappointment escaped the lips of the
discomfited party, but in an instant, as if upon a preconcerted signal,
the council fires were extinguished, and the clashing of warlike weapons
broke in upon the stillness. Next came heavy blows, and then deep groans
of agony. No articulate sound was heard in the
thick<i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e,</i> but the voice of Eoneguski, calling upon
both parties to cease their unnatural strife, and reminding them they
were brethren.&mdash;That, according to the customs of their nation, a
vote had fairly been taken, and that it was the duty of the vanquished
party to submit peaceably to a result which, however he might himself
regret, was yet lawful. For a long time his entreaties were like the
breath of the winds upon the troubled ocean, serving only to aggravate
the fearful turmoil.&mdash;But at length the sounds of strife grew
fainter. Eoneguski had placed himself between the contending parties,
and, at the infinite peril of his own person, accompanied the mediatorial
accents of his voice, by intercepting many a deadly blow from each side
directed against an adversary.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the scene, by the dim light, he discovered Gideon
near him, bleeding and bloody, yet pressing on fiercely towards his
antagonists. Now was vengeance for all his wrongs within the grasp of the
Cherokee chief&mdash;his enemy within his reach, wounded, exhausted, and
blind with passion&mdash;himself fresh, uninjured, cool and
collected&mdash;a single blow of his vigorous arm could lay the traitor
dead at his feet, and none would suspect from whence the destruction
came. The Little Deer might yet console him amid his
afflictions.&mdash;&ldquo;Gideon,&rdquo; he said, in a voice which, in
spite of himself, quivered with emotion, &ldquo;cease from
blood.&mdash;It is Eoneguski.&mdash;It is thy friend who
speaks.&mdash;His heart is warm with the memory of days that are
past.&mdash;He has forgotten his displeasure.&mdash;Let Gideon live and
be happy, and fill with comfort the heart of the Little Deer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment a stout Indian was rushing upon Gideon, with his
tomahawk elevated, to cleave him to the earth. There was no time for
warning or interference, when a pale shadow passed between the white man
and the assailing Indian. The shriek of a female was heard, as the
tomahawk descended. The blood spouted out, both upon Gideon and
Eoneguski, from the deep gash made by the trenchant weapon, as the shadow
fell to the earth. Surprise at what had happened, chained motionless the
lately impetuous Indian, and he did not renew his attack upon Gideon.
Dark as it was, the battle ceased instantly, as it would have done in
some ancient tournament, when the dropping of the warder's staff
indicated the pleasure of the presiding power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A light! a light!&rdquo; was the quick cry from both Gideon and
Eoneguski. Not long were they in rekindling a yet smoking firebrand, and
bearing it to the spot where a young female lay upon the ground, with the
blood gushing freely from her heart, in which the tomahawk had been
deeply buried. She had evidently been handsome, although now an emaciated
skeleton. Her dress, and the expression yet lingering in her countenance,
proclaimed that the fair and now lifeless body had recently been the
tenement of an insane spirit.&mdash;This was all that could be read of
her history by any present&mdash;save one. Gideon Aymor no sooner caught
a glimpse of her face, half concealed by the blood-stained tresses, than
he passionately exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;It is Patty Stevens!&rdquo; and,
turning away, retired from the scene.</p>

<p>Deeply affected were both the savages and the American commissioners,
when they looked upon this innocent victim of a strife, to which they
were all in some measure parties, and interest actively awoke to learn
her story.</p>

<p>In that mysterious way, in which the most secret facts, if they
possess any interest, gain publicity, the delicate and sentimental
attachment of the sensitive creature to Gideon became known; and it
farther appeared that, after his second departure to the Indian country,
she continued to decline.&mdash;That her chief comfort was the society of
her friend Atha, until, by an occurrence not uncommon in the history of
consumption, the pulmonary excitement was transferred to the brain, and
she became frantic. After a time the violent symptoms of frenzy subsided,
and her malady assumed the form of quiet melancholy, accompanied by a
total absence of her reasoning powers. In this state of mind her extreme
attachment to Atha continued to manifest itself, and she would not
consent to be long out of her presence.</p>

<p>Soon after his marriage with the Little Deer, Gideon sent for his
sister Atha, to whom many considerations concurred in making the
invitation not less acceptable than exciting, and she accordingly went.
The hapless victim of insanity, missing her friend, became restless and
impatient, and finally made her escape, and arrived at Tesumtoe half
starved and emaciated, by the precarious subsistence she had met with in
her wanderings. There she took no notice of any one but Atha, whom she
was delighted to see, manifesting her pleasure by all the indications
proper to childhood. Of Gideon she seemed to have no recognisance; but on
the day of his departure to attend the council at Eonee, she also was
missing. Doubtless she was led by an inexplicable instinct, for which the
insane are remarkable, and had lingered unseen, as a sort of guardian
spirit over the author of her misfortunes, until the clashing of arms
brought her within the area where the council had been holden. She was
just in time to interpose her own life between his and the weapon
destined for its destruction.</p>

<p>Several Indians, dead and wounded, were found upon the scene of
strife, but the number was far less than might have been expected,
unquestionably owing, in a great measure, to the interference of
Eoneguski.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_25">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h3>

<p><br>
                          My task is done&mdash;my song hath

                          The spell should break of this protracted

<p align="right">BYRON.</p>

<p>THE fruitless struggle was over, and the morning sun rose upon the
stark and bloody bodies of the few Indians who had secured to themselves
the possession of at least a few feet of their native soil, by dying in
the contest for its destiny, and the contract was signed by which that
beautiful country, now constituting the County of Macon, in North
Carolina, was transferred from the Cherokees to the white people.</p>

<p>As soon as the dead bodies of the Indians, who had fallen, were
committed to the earth, and the other necessary arrangements could be
made, the remains of Patty Stevens, attended by the American
Commissioners, Yenacona, Atha, Gideon, the Little Deer, and a very large
number of Indians, including Eoneguski, were conveyed to the Homony with
imposing solemnity, to repose forever beside its murmuring waters.</p>

<p>Robert Aymor, who had returned from the South-western expedition, was
greatly excited when he saw the distant party winding its way along the
road we have so often had occasion to mention, and his parental bosom was
disquited with apprehensions for one or both of his absent children. He
was not long however in learning the melancholy truth, or in mingling his
sympathy with the grief of the bereaved parents, who were summoned to his
residence, where the funeral party had halted. The piteous tidings spread
quickly to all the little farm-houses which skirted the Homony, and their
tenants came flocking in to pay their last testimony of respect to their
neighbor's daughter.</p>

<p>When all that could reasonably be expected had arrived, and
preparations were making to convey the deceased to her narrow bed, two
individuals apparently fatigued and travel-worn, were seen approaching.
No circumstances, however affecting, are sufficient to quell in the human
heart the principle of curiosity, and few eyes but were now turned from
that calm and quiet object lying before them, in the melancholy beauty of
death, to the two persons advancing; and many were not long in detecting
in one of them their lost acquaintance John Welch. The imagination of the
reader must supply what followed this discovery. Deep sorrow and intense
joy were seen mingling their currents&mdash;and tears for the dead were
blended with shouts of joy for the unhoped for return of the living.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By de powers my man,&rdquo; said Welch's companion, &ldquo;may
de divil fly away wid me if I know wheder to laugh or cry whin I look you
way, and say de poor crater yonder, just about de age of my own Marry
lying stiff and cowld, and de owld man and woman waping over har as if
deir hearts were breaking&mdash;by de powers says I, but I must wape wid
dem.&mdash;But I turn on de idder side, and sais de sparkle of de eye,
and de smiling faces wid which so manny are resaiving you, and Jonathan,
siz I, you may jist as will go crazy at onest wid plishure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the excitement was a little over&mdash;&ldquo;Who is this you
have brought with you here,&rdquo; said Aymor, in an under tone to
Welch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is one,&rdquo; replied Welch, &ldquo;to whom I am greatly
indebted&mdash;he is both a physician and blacksmith, and is commonly
called Dr. Wooddie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no stranger to him by name, although I have not to my
knowledge seen him before,&rdquo; answered Aymor&mdash;&ldquo;but he is
heartily welcome to the Homony, both on your account, and his
own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Wooddie was soon at home in the house of Robert Aymor, and it
is only necessary to add, by way of explanation of his arrival with
Welch, that having gone as a volunteer on the Southwestern expedition, he
lingered a little after his discharge on his way homeward, and arrived at
the place where Welch was recovered of his wound, just in time to
accompany him to the Homony in his progress towards home.</p>

<p>As soon as the simple ceremony of interring the young martyr to
innocent affection was over, most of Robert Aymor's guests departed,
including the Commissioners, who had completed their business, and the
large body of the Indians who had attended them thus far. Some of the
guests remained to witness the espousals of John Welch and Atha, to which
there was not only no longer any impediment, but they met the hearty
approbation of the friends and relations of both parties.</p>

<p>Eoneguski was reluctantly one of those who remained, but consented to
do so that he might thereby testify the sincerity of his reconciliation
with Welch, as well as conceal any appearance of chagrin at the
disappointment of his hopes by the Little Deer.</p>

<p>As soon as the wedding was over, Doctor Wooddie prosecuted his return
to his blacksmith's and doctor's shop, on the Blue Ridge, to his
termagant wife and sooty children, living to this day not only in fact,
but in the everlasting records of the acts of Assembly.</p>

<p>A few days more, and Aymor parted not only with all his guests, but
two of his children, who had, by marriage, become duly incorporated with
the red people, whom, in the aggregate, he detested, however much he
might esteem and regard particular individuals. Soon afterwards old
lawyer Johns carried off his second daughter, and has contributed his
share, notwithstanding his very late beginning, to the fast growing
population of the western region.</p>

<p>Robert Aymor, now well stricken in years, with the dignified title of
General Aymor, with a numerous posterity around him, still dwells on the
Homony. As the hero of two wars, he was elected to represent his county
in the General Assembly, where he was also chosen a Brigadier General of
the State militia.</p>

<p>His wife Dolly was delighted with this latter dignity, and in the joy
of her heart, exclaimed upon his return home&mdash;&ldquo;Bob Aymor, they
tell me that they have made you a Gineral&mdash;What shall I be called
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An old fool, as you always were;&rdquo; replied the impatient
husband, provoked at this new instance of his wife's folly. But he very
soon, by some act of kindness, bound up the wound he had inflicted, and
this ill-matched couple are likely to jog on to the end of their journey,
as harmoniously as most whom fortune has paired, living in habits of
intimacy with their old neighbors Welch and Stevens, who, with their
respective wives, are still spared by Providence.</p>

<p>After becoming the father of several children, lawyer Johns paid
nature's great debt, and the places that once knew him, now know him no
more. It is more than probable a similar fate has befallen the rest of
the legal corps, practising at Waynesville, at the time mentioned in our
story.</p>

<p>For many years after our acquaintance with him in the vicinity of
Waynesville, the hospitable mansion of Mr. Holland invited to its ever
open door the wayworn traveller, who always departed with his body
recruited, by a comfortable bed and wholesome viands, and his spirit
refreshed by the unpretending piety and moral excellence of the worthy
family, at the head of which the old man forcibly reminded him of one of
the ancient patriarchs</p>

<p>John Welch and Gideon Aymor, with their respective wives, and
Yenacona, whose life, passing like a stormy day, now promised to close in
brightness and peace, took an affecting leave of their friends on the
Homony. To Robert Aymor's family the latter during her short visit had
greatly endeared herself, and planted in the hearts of the younger
members seeds of piety, which, in due time, it is to be hoped, sprang up
into everlasting life.</p>

<p>John Welch determined to assume the rights his maternity conferred
upon him, and take his proper station in the great Cherokee family. On
his arrival in the &ldquo;Nation,&rdquo; he adopted the name of Oocomoo,
which had been given him in infancy by the natives. His birthright
divested Gideon of the chieftainship of Tesumtoe, as well as the
principality of the whole Cherokee tribe&mdash;Oocomoo being descended
from the oldest fruitful branch of the family of Moytoy. Besides this,
the venerable Santuchee, who, preceded by his faithful Wattuna, had long
been trembling on the very verge of existence, and was finally
precipitated into the grave, by the determination of the tribe to
alienate the lands in which Sugar Town was included, committed his people
with his last breath, to the guardianship of Oocomoo.</p>

<p>Tesumtoe was also within the territory recently transferred to the
white people, and consequently all such of its late proprietors as were
not willing to mingle with the whites, subject to all the disadvantages
of their tawny complexions, were compelled to seek for themselves another
place of residence. Nothing remained to the tribe of those possessions,
which once constituted the middle settlements; and a small corner on the
Hiwassee was all that was left of their formerly innumerable Valley
towns. On the Hiwassee Gideon, in right of his wife, was a large
proprietor, and there determined to fix his home, where, profiting by his
recent striking lessons of the heart, and the example of his amiable and
pious wife, he lived prosperously, and, by comparison, virtuously,
rearing a numerous and well-trained offspring. But arrangements, which
extinguished the Indian title on the eastern side of the father of
waters, forced him at length to seek a distant and untried home, teaching
him, by bitter experience, the natural tendency of those measures which,
opposed by Eoneguski, had been advocated by himself.</p>

<p>Oocomoo, with his wife and mother, as the head chief of his tribe,
transferred his residence, immediately after his marriage, to the
Overhill territory, where he remained until the event above mentioned,
against the occurrence of which he made every effort in his power.
Previous to his departure for the &ldquo;Far West,&rdquo; nature, as if
reluctant to remove Yenacona so distant from the remains of her beloved
De Lisle, peacefully terminated her earthly trials, and gave to all of
her that was mortal a resting place in her own land. She desired to be
buried after the Christian manner, and that a plain black cross might
mark the place of her sepulture at Tesumtoe. Her request was strictly
complied with, and Oocomoo and Atha dropped tears of affectionate regret
over the extraordinary being, to whom the former owed his birth, ere they
turned, with reluctant footsteps, to the untrodden wilds on the westward
of the great Mississippi.</p>

<p>Eoneguski foresaw with sagacious eye, that the red men, as a nation,
were to find no permanent resting place until driven, like the
predecessors of his fathers, beyond the ken of those who now coveted
their possessions. He felt that the people of Eonee were dissolved, as a
family, as soon as it was decided that their town must be sold, and that
they should remove from those objects around which their affections had
so long rallied in common. All the strong ties that bound him to his
tribe had thus been severed;&mdash;towards it he felt no longer drawn by
those affections of the heart which would have led him to exclaim, in the
beautiful and pathetic language of the Bible, &ldquo;Whither thou goest,
I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge&mdash;thy people shall be
my people, and thy God my God&mdash;where thou diest I will die, and
there also will I be buried.&rdquo; He preferred still to linger near the
scenes of his joys and his afflictions&mdash;of his hopes and
disappointments&mdash;where a tear of filial piety might occasionally
water the grave of Eonah, and the pleasing dreams of his youth revisit
his heart by the pale light of memory, while walking among the objects
with which they were associated.</p>

<p>Having made known his purpose to his tribe, he accordingly converted
all his property into moveables, and purchased of the State of North
Carolina a large body of land upon the waters of the Oconalufty, in the
County of Haywood.</p>

<p>Thither he was followed by a number of his people, amounting to
upwards of an hundred, who dwell on his lands, cultivating them for their
own benefit, yielding to him only a competent support, and looking up to
him as a father. Like the chieftain of a Highland clan in Scotland, he
possesses over them unlimited control, but exercises it only with
kindness and benevolence.</p>

<p>Wissa, no longer a slave, but, according to the promise of Eonah,
fulfilled by his dutiful son, a freeman, holds for this fragment of the
red family the post of linkister, and conducts in that capacity its
intercourse with the whites, with so much integrity and propriety as to
maintain for it that high respect which the noble and elevated character
of its head is so well calculated to inspire.</p>

<p>With this faithful attendant upon his steps, may Eoneguski
occasionally be seen, during the sessions of courts, both at Waynesville
and Franklin. The latter is the ancient site of Eonee, and the county
seat of Macon County, as Waynesville is of Haywood. At Franklin a deeper
shade of melancholy settles over the countenance of our hero than at
Waynesville, but at either place the beholder is struck with his
dignified and interesting appearance, and is irresistibly led to inquire,
&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; The answer is always given in that subdued
manner and tone of voice indicative of the deep respect, approaching to
reverence, with which the speaker is accustomed to look upon his
person&mdash;&ldquo;It is Eoneguski.&mdash;It is the old
Chief.&rdquo;</p>
