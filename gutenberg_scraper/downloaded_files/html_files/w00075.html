<h1>The Hunting of Harry Tracy</h1>

<h3>The Most Thrilling Man Hunt of Recent Western History</h3>

<h4>by</h4>

<h1>William MacLeod Raine</h1>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<p>NO HALO of romance hangs over the head of Harry Tracy. He does not
belong to the old West. He had no Bret Harte complex. There is no
chance that blended fact and fiction will make of his life a legend. He
was a criminal at heart, a cold-blooded killing machine. But it must be
admitted that in his own line he was pre-eminent.</p>

<p>The most thrilling man hunt America has ever known began on the
morning of June 9, 1902, at the gates of the Oregon Penitentiary, and
continued with unabated vigour until August 5th. Early on June 9th
Harry Tracy, murderer and convicted burglar, assisted by his partner,
David Merrill, escaped from prison after killing three guards, wounding
a fourth, and shattering the leg of another prisoner who attempted to
wrest from him the rifle with which he was armed. For nearly two months
this keen-eyed, resourceful, and desperate outlaw wrote in blood the
most thrilling melodrama ever enacted in real life. No "penny dreadful"
ever bristled with such fascinating impossibilities; no character in
fiction ever combined with such wonderful nerve and daring so much
shrewdness, dogged determination, deadly skill with weapons, and
knowledge of human nature as was displayed by the outlaw Tracy. To say
that not once, during the months in which he was hunted by hundreds of
armed men and by bloodhounds, did he show the white feather, or even
the slightest excitement, is to tell but a small part of the truth.
Many men on the Western frontier might have emulated his coolness and
nerve, but not one of them could have paralleled his smiling audacity,
his contempt for fearful odds, the skill with which he eluded his
pursuers, and the unfailing accuracy with which he executed his
carefully planned man&oelig;uvres. Whenever the arm of the law was
stretched forth to gather him in, Tracy like a tiger at bay, showed his
teeth and bit so suddenly and so fearfully that brave men stood aghast.
His fight for liberty was the most desperate in the criminal annals of
America. The exploits of the famous Jesse James gang are not to be
compared with the lurid escape and subsequent pursuit of Harry Tracy
across hundreds of miles of unfriendly country. For daring, fertility
of resource, and cold-blooded nerve his fight for liberty against
almost impossible numbers is without a parallel. Hunted by thousands of
armed men, with a reward of $8,000 on his head, dead or alive, Tracy
for months defied capture, leaving dead and wounded men behind him
whenever he was hard pressed.</p>

<p>On June 9, 1902, the foundry gang of prisoners at the Salem (Oregon)
Penitentiary was marched to its work as usual by Guards Girard and
Ferrell. The convicts were counted in and announced as all present by
Girard. While the words were still on his lips a rifle shot echoed
through the yard, and Ferrell fell forward with a cry of agony. He had
been killed by Harry Tracy, a convict, who had already murdered two men
in Colorado and was serving a twenty-years' sentence for burglary along
with an accomplice named David Merrill. Tracy, seconded by his partner
in crime, now turned upon the other guards and began shooting. A life
prisoner, Ingram by name, leaped upon Tracy with the intention of
disarming him, but was immediately shot down by Merrill. In the
confusion the two desperate men scaled the prison walls by means of a
ladder which they found near at hand. Once over they turned their
attention to the fence guards. S. R. Jones, patrolling the northwest
corner of the stockade, fell, pierced by two bullets. Another guard,
Duncan Ross, was wounded. Guard Tiffany emptied his rifle at the men
but failed to hit his mark. He was himself wounded and fell from the
wall to the ground, where he was picked up by the two escaping
prisoners, who calmly used him as a shield while they retreated to the
woods. At the edge of the forest they shot him, took his rifle, and
disappeared into the underbrush.</p>

<p>Tracy and Merrill were well armed with short Winchesters, which it
is thought must have been secretly supplied to them by sympathizers who
visited the prison in the guise of excursionists. They had already
killed three men in order to escape, and while at liberty were a menace
to the community. So an urgent call was sent for assistance. Sheriff
Durbin, with a heavily armed posse, immediately answered the telephone
message sent him, and appeared at the prison to assist Superintendent
Lee, of the penitentiary, in recapturing the escaped convicts.</p>

<p>The two criminals, however, managed to elude pursuit during the
whole day, and under cover of night passed through Salem. Here they
held up a man named J. W. Stewart, made him disrobe, and took his
clothing. Later an expressman named Welch discarded, at their orders,
an overcoat and a pair of overalls; and the stable of one Felix
Labaucher furnished them with two fast horses. One notable fact in the
escape of the desperado Tracy is the fear which he somehow managed to
instil into the minds of the hardy frontiersmen among whom he lived for
the next two months, and which stood him in good stead on many
occasions when he was hard pressed.</p>

<p>Heavily armed, in citizens' clothing, and mounted on good horses,
the convicts were now prepared to make a stubborn fight for liberty. No
more dangerous criminal than Tracy, in fact, was ever turned loose upon
a community. He was a dead shot and did not know what fear meant.</p>

<p>Bloodhounds sent down from the Washington State Penitentiary
followed the scent of the fugitives for some time, but finally lost it.
The pair were seen next morning at Brooks, a station on the Southern
Pacific Railway eight mlles north of Salem. During the night they had
found it necessary to get rid of their horses. On June 11th the two men
were surrounded by a posse of fifty men near Gervais. They were still
on the line of the Southern Pacific and were headed north for the State
of Washington via Portland. The couple were known to be exceedingly
well armed, for during the night they had had the audacity to hold up
two of the pursuing posse and relieve them of their weapons! Before
noon a hundred men surrounded the woods in which the men lurked. Every
man within a radius of ten miles who possessed a gun was summoned to
join the posse, and Company F of the Oregon State National Guards also
arrived upon the scene. A complete cordon surrounded the apparently
doomed men, but during the night the two desperadoes slipped silently
through the lines and escaped.</p>

<p>They were next seen at the house of Mrs. Akers, where they forced
the farmer's wife to prepare them a good breakfast. After they had gone
the farmer telephoned to Sheriff Durbin, who came on at once with his
posse and the bloodhounds.</p>

<p>The escaped prisoners pressed forward to Clackamas County, where
Sheriff Cook with a posse and three companies of militia took up the
chase. As they continued north the desperadoes lived on the country,
holding up farms for food and horses as they travelled. They always
boldly announced who they were. A dozen times they were shot at,
several times they were surrounded, and once Tracy fired and winged one
of his pursuers. The reward for the capture of the convicts was
doubled, and doubled again, and public excitement grew intense. For
five days the sheriff and his posse continued the chase, and then gave
up, weary and discouraged.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tracy had forced a farmer at the muzzle of his revolver
to row him and his companion across the Columbia River into Washington.
They dined at the house of a farmer named Peedy, whom they tied and
gagged before leaving. Sheriff Marsh, of Clarke County, with a very
large force, took up the chase with energy. A four-cornered duel took
place between the fugitives and two of the posse who came in touch with
them, but the convicts again escaped unhurt. For some days after this
episode their trail was completely lost.</p>

<p>It was on July 2d that Tracy reappeared to enact the most stirring
scenes of his melodramatic career. He had been heading for the Puget
Sound country, and after holding up a farmer or two for practice he
modestly decided to honour the city of Seattle with a visit. It was
early morning, and the sun was just breaking through the mist and fog
that hung over South Bay, near Olympia, the state capital, when a man
entered the tent of an oyster fishery company and ordered Mr. Horatio
Alling, the manager, and his two men to furnish him a meal.</p>

<p>"I'm Tracy, the convict," said the stranger. "I want something to
eat right away. Be quiet, raise no fuss, and I won't harm you."</p>

<p>A launch lay at anchor near the tent, and Tracy ordered one of the
men to call her captain to breakfast. The convict waited coolly till
Captain Clark and his son had finished breakfast and then ordered Clark
to get up steam at once, as he desired to go to Seattle. Before leaving
he tied Mr. Alling and the cook hand and foot and helped himself to any
clothes that took his fancy.</p>

<p>From 1894 till 1898 I had lived near Seattle and at this time I was
back there visiting my parents. Alling had been a very close friend of
mine, and his adventure with Tracy stimulated my already keen interest
in the chase. Later, in the capacity of a newspaper correspondent, I
saw a good deal of the men who had charge of the capture of the out-
law and was at one time with the posse (entirely as a pacifist) which
operated near Bothell.</p>

<p>During the launch ride to Seattle Tracy remained at one end of the
little cabin, his gun resting in his lap ready for use in case any of
the actions of his crew appeared to him suspicious. For twelve hours
the bandit was complete master of the situation. He was easy,
unconcerned, and debonair, ready to joke and to laugh with his
unwilling servants, but his steely eyes never relaxed their vigilance
for a moment. Someone asked him where his partner Merrill was.</p>

<p>Tracy's face set hard.</p>

<p>"I killed him," he answered quietly.</p>

<p>"Killed him?" reiterated his questioner, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, I killed him. He had no nerve and he was a traitor. I read in
the Portland papers after our escape that it was due to information
from Merrill that I was caught in the first place&mdash;that time I
stole the engine and was knocked senseless by a glancing shot. Merrill
had told them where they could find me. Then, too, he was a coward,
always ready to bolt. He was no good. The man was frightened to death
all the time. It made me angry when the papers gave him half the credit
for our escape. I told him he was a coward, and he got huffy. Then we
decided to fight a duel when we were near Chehalis. We were to start,
back to back, and walk ten paces each, then wheel round and begin
firing. He haggled so in arranging the terms that I knew he meant to
play false. I couldn't trust him, so when I had taken eight steps I
fired over my shoulder. I hit him in the back. The first shot did not
finish him, so I shot again. He only got what he deserved. The fellow
meant to kill me treacherously and steal out of the country through the
big timber, leaving my dead body among the leaves."</p>

<p>The finding of Merrill's body two weeks later proved the truth of
Tracy's treachery toward his companion. He had evidently found that the
other man was losing his nerve, and had got rid of him to save further
trouble.</p>

<p>All day Tracy displayed the greatest carelessness in regard to human
life. At one time he desired the captain of the launch to run in close
to McNeil's Island, where a government military prison is located, in
order that he might get a pot shot at one of the guards. During the day
he dozed slightly once or twice, but, as his rifle was across his lap
and the slightest movement awakened him, the crew dared not interfere
with him. At Meadow Point, near the city of Seattle, Tracy finished his
yachting trip, tied the captain and crew up, and went ashore, forcing
one of the terrified men to accompany him as a guide. The ascendancy
this man acquired over everybody he met is remarkable.</p>

<p>The outlaw headed toward the north end of Lake Washington and was
recognized more than once before he reached Bothell. Here he lay hidden
till morning in the dense brush and secured some much-needed sleep. It
was raining hard, but there is no doubt that the escaped convict found
shelter from the storm under some big logs Meanwhile, Seattle was full
of wild rumours about Tracy Every stray tramp was an object of
suspicion, and the greatest excitement prevailed among people. Before
night the excitement had increased tenfold. Harry Tracy, it was
reported, had come into touch with two posses, had engaged in battle
with them, killed three officers and wounded one, and had himself
escaped unhurt!</p>

<p>Persistent reports came to the city of Tracy's presence near
Bothell. It was said that he was surrounded in a brickyard; that he had
several times been definitely identified by men who saw him skulking in
the heavy timber. Sheriff Cudihee, of King County, a fearless and
efficient officer who had a good record for running down criminals, at
once ordered posses to the scene and hastened there himself. It may be
stated in passing that from that moment to the time of Tracy's death
Sheriff Cudihee hung doggedly to the trail of the flying bandit. Other
sheriffs took up the hunt and dropped it when the convict had passed
out of their bailiwicks, but Cudihee alone followed him like a
bloodhound wherever he went, until the question of Tracy's escape or
capture came to bc a personal issue between Edward Cudihee and Harry
Tracy, two of the most fearless and determined men that ever carried a
gun.</p>

<p>At Bothell the posse separated, and every road was guarded. Two
officials from Everett, several from Seattle, and Mr. Louie B. Sefrit,
a reporter for the Seattle Times, started down the road toward Pontiac,
part of them following the railway track and part the wagon road. About
a hundred yards southeast of where the railroad track and the wagon
road cross again there were two small cabins standing in a yard which
was much overgrown with grass, weeds, and old tree stumps. Three men,
named Williams, Brewer, and Nelson, jumped through a wire fence and
started toward the cabins, while the others went down the track to
examine the cabins from that side. Said one Raymond to Sefrit, the
reporter:</p>

<p>"I believe Tracy is in that yard."</p>

<p>Sefrit answered that he thought so, too, for the grass had been
freshly beaten down. He pointed to a black stump some five yards in
front of him. Like all tree stumps in the Puget Sound country, it had
been partly burned.</p>

<p>"That's exactly where I believe he is," said Raymond.
"Let's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He never finished the sentence. From behind the stump arose Tracy
himself, his rifle at his shoulder. There came a flash, and Anderson,
one of the deputies, fell. Still another spit of flame belched from the
rifle, and Raymond fell back with a stifled cry. He was quite dead
before help reached him. Sefrit took a shot at the desperado with a
Colt's revolver, whereupon Tracy wheeled and let drive at him. Sefrit,
realizing that he was in an exposed position, fell as if shot. The
outlaw fired again at him, then waited watchfully to make sure he had
killed his man. A bunch of grass lay between Sefrit's head and Tracy,
but the reporter could see the convict crouching behind the stump and
knew that the slightest movement meant death. So for some minutes the
Times reporter lay there in an agony of suspense, expecting every
moment to feel a bullet tearing through his breast. Then Tracy slowly
began to back away in the drenching rain. Two more shots rang out, and
Jack Williams, who had been coming forward from the rear, fell,
desperately wounded.</p>

<p>Tracy scudded away in the thick underbrush, and half a mile from the
scene of battle relieved a rancher of a horse he was riding. This he
presently discarded, impressing into his service a farmer named Louis
Johnson, with his wagon. He forced the farmer to drive him to Fremont,
which is a suburb of Seattle. By this time the escaped convict was very
hungry. He made Johnson hitch his team to the fence outside the home of
Mrs. R. H. Van Horn and then invited himself to dinner. Mrs. Van Horn
at once recognized Tracy from his published photograph.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Food, madam, and clothing," returned the urbane murderer. It
chanced that there was a man named Butterfield in the house, and from
him Tracy coolly took the dry clothing which he wore. Being in a good
humour, the bandit dropped into the kitchen and conversed with Mrs. Van
Horn while she prepared his meal for him.</p>

<p>"I have never 'held up' a lady before," he explained, while eating
the food. "I don't want to have to tie you when I leave. Will you
promise not to say anything about my having been here?"</p>

<p>"For to-night I will&mdash;but not to-morrow morning," answered the
plucky little woman.</p>

<p>"That will be all right," said Tracy; "I'll be far enough away by
then. I want to tell you, madam, that I haven t enjoyed a meal so much
in three years." He then mentioned his "yachting trip," as he called
it, from Olympia to Seattle.</p>

<p>At eight-thirty o'clock a knock came at the door. Mr. Butterfield
answered it and said that it was the grocery boy.</p>

<p>"If you tell him anything it will mean death to the men here," Tracy
told Mrs. Van Horn significantly, as she went to give her orders to the
boy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she took occasion to nod her head toward the door and
whisper the one word "Tracy" to the boy. He understood, and two minutes
later was lashing his horse along the road toward Fremont. When Tracy
rose to depart an hour later Sheriff Cudihee lay in ambush within six
feet of the Johnson wagon.</p>

<p>Tracy thanked Mrs. Van Horn for his meal in courteous fashion, then
stepped down the path to the road with Butterfield and Johnson on
either side of him. Meanwhile, the vigilant Sheriff Cudihee lay in wait
for his man near the wagon. As Tracy sauntered down the path the
sheriff of King County covered him every inch of the way with his
Winchester. There was just a shadow of doubt in his mind as to which of
the three was the man he wanted. He decided to wait until the outlaw
climbed into the wagon.</p>

<p>Suddenly out of the darkness rushed Police Officer Breece, Mr. J. I.
McKnight, and Game Warden Neil Rawley. Breece covered the convict with
his rifle from a distance of about ten yards and cried, "Throw down
that gun, Tracy!"</p>

<p>The desperado wheeled and fired point-blank. Breece fell over, a
dead man. Twice more the convict fired, this time at Rawley, and the
game warden went to the ground mortally wounded. Tracy dashed through
the fence and made for the woods. The sheriff levelled his rifle and
fired twice at the disappearing convict, but owing to the darkness
neither shot took effect. Harry Tracy, burglar, outlaw, and murderer,
had again broken through the death trap that had been prepared for him.
Had it not been for the recklessness of interfering officials Cudihee
would undoubtedly have caught or killed his man.</p>

<p>With the curious mania which he had for continually doubling on his
tracks Tracy again headed for Bothell, near which point he held up
Farmer Fisher for clothes and provisions. Cornered in a strip of
country not twenty miles square, in the midst of which was a city of
one hundred and twenty thousand population, though three bodies lay in
the county morgue to attest his unerring skill and others lay wounded
near to death in the hospitals, yet Harry Tracy still roamed the
country like an Apache, uninjured and untamable. Whenever men bearded
him he left a trail of blood behind him in his relentless flight. He
himself condoned his crimes because, as he said, he killed to satisfy
no lust for blood but simply to keep his cherished liberty.</p>

<p>In order to understand how one fearless man was able for so long a
time to defy the law, the nature of the country must be considered. The
Puget Sound country was at that time the most densely timbered on
earth. The underbrush is very heavy, and a rank growth of ferns some
four feet high covers the ground like a carpet. A man might slip into
the ferns and remain hidden for months within a dozen yards of the
roadside provided the food question were eliminated. The one thing that
Tracy feared was the bloodhounds which were set on his trail, and after
he had shot these, his mind was more at ease.</p>

<p>After holding up another household of Johnsons,
Tracy&mdash;accompanied by their hired man, Anderson, whom he forced to
attend him as a human pack-horse&mdash;doubled back to Seattle by way
of Port Madison. He skirted the city till he came to South Seattle, and
then cut around the end of Lake Washington to Renton. At this point he
made himself the uninvited guest of the Jerrolds family. Walking up
from Renton with his unwilling companion, Tracy met Miss May Baker,
Mrs. McKinney, and young Jerrolds picking salmonberries. Tracy stopped
them, smiling. "I guess you have heard of me; I am Tracy," he said;
then added, "You needn't be afraid of me. I never harmed a woman in my
life, and I don't intend to begin now."</p>

<p>Talking easily with the women, Tracy walked along to the house, in
the rear of which he tied Anderson to a clump of bushes. He called the
Jerrolds boy and handed him two watches, which he wished sold in order
to buy two 45-calibre single-action Colt revolvers and a box of
cartridges. He threatened to kill everybody in the house in case the
boy betrayed him, but the lad was no sooner gone than he told Mrs.
Jerrolds that this was mere bluff. This iron-nerved murderer and outlaw
actually shed tears at this point.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't hurt you, Mother, for anything. I have a mother of my
own somewhere back East. I haven't done just right by her, but I reckon
all the mothers are safe from me, no matter what happens."</p>

<p>Presently Tracy brightened again and was laughing and talking with
the three women just as if they had been old acquaintances. It was
nearly time to prepare dinner, and Tracy carried in wood and
volunteered to get the water from the spring. Rifle in hand, he
sauntered down to the railroad track and filled his bucket with water.
As he did so a special train, bearing the posse which hunted him, came
round the bend. He ducked into the bushes to let it pass.</p>

<p>"I reckon there are some gentlemen in that train looking for me," he
remarked carelessly when he had reached the house. "I saw a reporter
there. They are always in the lead. First you see a reporter, then a
cloud of dust, and alter a while the deputies. It's the interviewer I'm
afraid of!" And he laughed.</p>

<p>There was much gay talk and laughter during the meal which followed,
in which Tracy took the lead. His repartee was apt and spirited, and
his sallies were irresistible. The Jerrolds boy had informed the
sheriff's officer of Tracy's whereabouts long ago, and by this time the
deputies were beginning to surround the house. Everybody was alarmed
save the outlaw himself. He strolled to the window and looked out at an
enterprising photographer who was trying to take a picture of the
house</p>

<p>"My trousers are too short and they're not nicely ironed," he said.
"I like to be neatly dressed before ladies. I guess I'll go out and
hold up a deputy for a pair."</p>

<p>Miss Baker was worried in case she might not get home before dark.
Tracy reassured her saying it was a pleasant moonlit night, and that he
would be glad to accompany her if he might have the pleasure.</p>

<p>As the day wore on the deputies gathered thicker and thicker around
the house, cautiously drawing closer and closer, for they knew that the
outlaw was a dead shot. Finally Tracy concluded that he had better be
going. From his Chesterfieldian manner he might have been bidding his
hostess good-bye after some elaborate function. From the back doorstep
he waved them all a merry good day and wished them all manner of luck.
As it happened, just at that moment poor Anderson had been discovered
tied to a tree. One of the deputies gave a shout, and the others
crowded round to see what was the matter. In the excitement Tracy
quietly slipped down to the river and disappeared!</p>

<p>Day after day the chase after this extraordinary man continued.
Hundreds of men beat the woods and patrolled the roads in vain. Once
Tracy was wounded, but managed to keep under cover until he was again
able to travel. He played hide-and-seek with the officers of King
County for weeks, then suddenly broke away for the Cascades on
horseback. Weeks later he turned up in eastern Washington en route for
his old stamping ground, the "Hole-in-the-Wall" country. More than once
his fondness for loitering for days in the same spot showed itself. His
effrontery knew no bounds. At one place he made use of the telephone to
call up a sheriff in order to tease him about his ill-success in
capturing Tracy. Before he left, however, he gave the poor official one
grain of consolation. "You've done better than the other sheriffs," he
said. "You've talked with the man you want, anyway. Good-bye; I'm
afraid you won't see me again."</p>

<p>But he did. Eastern Washington does not afford any such hiding
ground as the big forests of the western part of the state. From point
to point the telephone handed on the message that Tracy had just
passed. He doubled here, there, and everywhere; but he could not shake
off his relentless pursuers, aided as they were by the telephone wires.
Sheriff Cudihee, now thoroughly aroused, swore never to leave the chase
till Tracy was taken. Sheriffs Gardner and Doust and Cudihee held the
passes and closed in on him.</p>

<p>Tracy had reached the rough country south of the Colville Indian
reservation. He had become gaunt as an ill-fed wolf. Hunger, cold, and
exposure have tamed more bad men than fear. They sap the physical
well-being which in some men is the spring of courage. But they did not
affect the iron nerve of his man. He was still as savage and as
dangerous as on the day when he broke out of the penitentiary. For two
days and nights the outlaw hung around the Eddy ranch, not far from
Creston, until a young man who saw him there raced with the news to
Sheriff Gardner, who hastened to the scene at once.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a party of five citizens of Creston, which is in Lincoln
County, stopped forever the evil career of the man who had travelled
four hundred miles and baffled thousands of pursuers. C. C. Straub,
deputy sheriff, Dr. E. C. Lanter, Maurice Smith, attorney, J. J.
Morrison, section foreman, and Frank Lillen Green, all armed to the
teeth, proceeded to the ranch of Mr. L. B. Eddy, where the outlaw was
known to be in hiding. The country thereabout is very rocky, and the
party took every care not to be caught in an ambush. They saw Farmer
Eddy mowing his hay, and while talking with him observed a strange man
emerge from the barn.</p>

<p>"Is that Tracy?" asked one of them.</p>

<p>"It surely is," answered Eddy.</p>

<p>Eddy followed orders and drove to the barn. Cautiously the members
of the posse followed him. Tracy came from the barn and began to help
his host unhitch the team. His rifle he had left in the barn, but his
revolvers he still carried. Suddenly he saw his pursuers.</p>

<p>"Who are those men?" he demanded, turning sharply to Eddy.</p>

<p>"Hold up your hands!" shouted the officers, without waiting for the
farmer's reply.</p>

<p>Like a flash Tracy jumped behind Eddy and the team and bade the
terrified farmer lead the horses to the barn. When near the door he
made a break to reach his rifle. A moment later he reappeared, rifle in
hand, and started headlong down the valley. Again his iron nerve had
brought him out of an apparently certain trap. Two shots he fired at
his pursuers, but neither of them had effect</p>

<p>The man hunters took up the chase at once. Tracy dodged behind a
rock and began firing rapidly. It was growing dark, however, and he
missed his men. Then he made a dash for a wheat field near at hand, the
officers firing at him as he, ran. Suddenly he stumbled and fell on his
face, but dragged himself on hands and knees into the field. He had
been hit.</p>

<p>Sheriff Gardner and his posse now arrived on the scene and
surrounded the field. Presently a single shot was heard by the
watchers. That shot sent the notorious bandit into eternity. In the
early morning the cordon cautiously worked its way into the field and
presently stumbled upon Harry Tracy's lifeless body. The most famous
man hunt in the history of the country had ended. Crippled and
bleeding, hopeless of escape, the bandit had shot himself sooner than
let himself be taken.</p>

<p>After escaping from a dozen sheriffs, slipping cleverly out of death
trap after death trap, and leaving behind him everywhere a trail of
blood that would not have discredited an Apache chief, Tracy fell at
last by his own hand rather than lose the liberty which he apparently
prized more than life itself.</p>
