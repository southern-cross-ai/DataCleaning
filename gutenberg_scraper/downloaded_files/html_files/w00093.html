  <p class="quote">When Jean's father, big Aleck Douglas of the Lazy A Ranch,
  is convicted of killing the man found shot to death in his kitchen, Jean,
  sure of his innocence, vows to prove it. But there seems no clue with which
  to start, except the sudden disappearance of one of her uncle's cowboys, and
  to find him requires more money than Jean possesses. Jean becomes a member of
  a moving-picture company and performs "stunts" and dare-devil feats until she
  is featured on the films as "Jean of the Lazy A," and her bank account
  steadily increases. Suddenly by chance she locates the much-wanted man, only
  to find that she has been following a blind trail. Then Fate takes a hand,
  and the sudden dénouement comes with no less surprise to Jean than it will to
  the reader.</p>

  <p class="quote">The author has achieved a feat of her own in this book, for
  a story lies within the story, and interwoven with the adventures of Jean and
  the crime at the Lazy A is a dramatic tale of the "movies." Of real people
  and real life, the author has never written a more fascinating, a more
  dramatic tale. "Jean of the Lazy A" has the "punch" that the movie director
  was so eternally demanding of his actors in the moving picture to which Jean
  gave the same title.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1">I. &mdash; HOW TROUBLE CAME TO THE LAZY A</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WITHOUT going into a deep, psychological discussion of the
  elements in men's souls that breed events, we may say with truth that the
  Lazy A ranch was as other ranches in the smooth tenor of its life until one
  day in June, when the finger of fate wrote bold and black across the face of
  it the word that blotted out prosperity, content, warm family ties,&mdash;all
  those things that go to make life worth while.</p>

  <p>Jean, sixteen and a range girl to the last fiber of her being, had gotten
  up early that morning and had washed the dishes and swept, and had shaken the
  rugs of the little living-room most vigorously. On her knees, with stiff
  brush and much soapy water, she had scrubbed the kitchen floor until the
  boards dried white as kitchen floors may be. She had baked a loaf of
  gingerbread, that came from the oven with a most delectable odor, and had
  wrapped it in a clean cloth to cool on the kitchen table. Her dad and Lite
  Avery would show cause for the baking of it when they sat down, fresh washed
  and ravenous, to their supper that evening. I mention Jean and her scrubbed
  kitchen and the gingerbread by way of proving how the Lazy A went unwarned
  and unsuspecting to the very brink of its disaster.</p>

  <p>Lite Avery, long and lean and silently content with life, had ridden away
  with a package of sandwiches, after a full breakfast and a smile from the
  slim girl who cooked it, upon the business of the day; which happened to be a
  long ride with one of the Bar Nothing riders, down in the breaks along the
  river. Jean's father, big Aleck Douglas, had saddled and ridden away alone
  upon business of his own. And presently, in mid- forenoon, Jean closed the
  kitchen door upon an immaculately clean house filled with the warm, fragrant
  odor of her baking, and in fresh shirt waist and her best riding-skirt and
  Stetson, went whistling away down the path to the stable, and saddled Pard,
  the brown colt that Lite had broken to the saddle for her that spring. In ten
  minutes or so she went galloping down the coulee and out upon the trail to
  town, which was fifteen miles away and held a chum of hers.</p>

  <p>So Lazy A coulee was left at peace, with scratching hens busy with the
  feeding of half-feathered chicks, and a rooster that crowed from the corral
  fence seven times without stopping to take breath. In the big corral a sorrel
  mare nosed her colt and nibbled abstractedly at the pile of hay in one
  corner, while the colt wabbled aimlessly up and sniffed curiously and then
  turned to inspect the rails that felt so queer and hard when he rubbed his
  nose against them. The sun was warm, and cloud-shadows drifted lazily across
  the coulee with the breeze that blew from the west. You never would dream
  that this was the last day,&mdash;the last few hours even,&mdash;when the
  Lazy A would be the untroubled home of three persons of whose lives it formed
  so great a part.</p>

  <p>At noon the hens were hovering their chickens in the shade of the mower
  which Lite was overhauling during his spare time, getting it ready for the
  hay that was growing apace out there in the broad mouth of the coulee. The
  rooster was wallowing luxuriously in a dusty spot in the corral. The young
  colt lay stretched out on the fat of its side in the sun, sound asleep. The
  sorrel mare lay beside it, asleep also, with her head thrown up against her
  shoulder. Somewhere in a shed a calf was bawling in bored lonesomeness away
  from its mother feeding down the pasture. And over all the coulee and the
  buildings nestled against the bluff at its upper end was spread that
  atmosphere of homey comfort and sheltered calm which surrounds always a home
  that is happy.</p>

  <p>Lite Avery, riding toward home just when the shadows were beginning to
  grow long behind him, wondered if Jean would be back by the time he reached
  the ranch. He hoped so, with a vague distaste at finding the place empty of
  her cheerful presence. Be looked at his watch; it was nearly four o'clock.
  She ought to be home by half-past four or five, anyway. He glanced sidelong
  at Jim and quietly slackened his pace a little. Jim was telling one of those
  long, rambling tales of the little happenings of a narrow life, and Lite was
  supposed to be listening instead of thinking about when Jean would return
  home. Jim believed he was listening, and drove home the point of his
  story.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, them's his very words. Art Osgood heard him. He'll do it, too,
  take it from me, Crofty is shore riled up this time."</p>

  <p>"Always is," Lite observed, without paying much attention. "I'll turn off
  here, Jim, and cut across. Got some work I want to get done yet to-night. So
  long."</p>

  <p>He swung away from his companion, whose trail to the Bar Nothing led him
  straight west, passing the Lazy A coulee well out from its mouth, toward the
  river. Lite could save a half mile by bearing off to the north and entering
  the coulee at the eastern side and riding up through the pasture. He wanted
  to see how the grass was coming on, anyway. The last rain should have given
  it a fresh start.</p>

  <p>He was in no great hurry, after all; he had merely been bored with Jim's
  company and wanted to go on alone. And then he could get the fire started for
  Jean. Lite's life was running very smoothly indeed; so smoothly that his
  thoughts occupied themselves largely with little things, save when they
  concerned themselves with Jean, who had been away to school for a year and
  had graduated from "high," as she called it, just a couple of weeks ago, and
  had come home to keep house for dad and Lite. The novelty of her presence on
  the ranch was still fresh enough to fill his thoughts with her slim
  attractiveness. Town hadn't spoiled her, he thought glowingly. She was the
  same good little pal,&mdash;only she was growing up pretty fast, now. She was
  a young lady already.</p>

  <p>So, thinking of her with the brightening of spirits which is the first
  symptom of the world-old emotion called love, Lite rounded the eastern arm of
  the bluff and came within sight of the coulee spread before him, shaped like
  the half of a huge platter with a high rim of bluff on three sides.</p>

  <p>His first involuntary glance was towards the house, and there was
  unacknowledged expectancy in his eyes. But he did not see Jean, nor any sign
  that she had returned. Instead, he saw her father just mounting in haste at
  the corral. He saw him swing his quirt down along the side of his horse and
  go tearing down the trail, leaving the wire gate flat upon the ground behind
  him,&mdash;which was against all precedent.</p>

  <p>Lite quickened his own pace. He did not know why big Aleck Douglas should
  be hitting that pace out of the coulee, but since Aleck's pace was habitually
  unhurried, the inference was plain enough that there was some urgent need for
  haste. Lite let down the rails of the barred gate from the meadow into the
  pasture, mounted, and went galloping across the uneven sod. His first anxious
  thought was for the girl. Had something happened to her?</p>

  <p>At the stable he looked and saw that Jean's saddle did not hang on its
  accustomed peg inside the door, and he breathed freer. She could not have
  returned, then. He turned his own horse inside without taking off the saddle,
  and looked around him puzzled. Nothing seemed wrong about the place. The
  sorrel mare stood placidly switching at the flies and suckling her gangling
  colt in the shady corner of the corral, and the chickens were pecking
  desultorily about their feeding-ground in expectation of the wheat that Jean
  or Lite would fling to them later on. Not a thing seemed unusual.</p>

  <p>Yet Lite stood just outside the stable, and the sensation that something
  was wrong grew keener. He was not a nervous person,&mdash;you would have
  laughed at the idea of nerves in connection with Lite Avery. He felt that
  something was wrong, just the same. It was not altogether the hurried
  departure of Aleck Douglas, either, that made him feel so. He looked at the
  house setting back there close to the bluff just where it began to curve
  rudely out from the narrowest part of the coulee. It was still and quiet,
  with closed windows and doors to tell there was no one at home. And yet, to
  Lite its very silence seemed sinister.</p>

  <p>Wolves were many, down in the breaks along the river that spring; and the
  coyotes were an ever-present evil among the calves, so that Lite never rode
  abroad without his six-shooter. He reached back and loosened it in the
  holster before he started up the sandy path to the house; and if you knew the
  Lazy A ranch as well as Lite knew it, from six years of calling it home, you
  would wonder at that action of his, which was instinctive and wholly
  unconscious.</p>

  <p>So he went up through the sunshine of late afternoon that sent his shadow
  a full rod before him, and he stepped upon the narrow platform before the
  kitchen door, and stood there a minute listening. He heard the mantel clock
  in the living-room ticking with the resonance given by a room empty of all
  other sound. Because his ears were keen, he heard also the little alarm clock
  in the kitchen tick-tick-tick on the shelf behind the stove where Jean kept
  it daytimes.</p>

  <p>Peaceful enough, for all the silence; yet Lite reached back and laid his
  fingers upon the smooth butt of his six-shooter and opened the door with his
  left hand, which was more or less awkward. He pushed the door open and
  stepped inside. Then for a full minute he did not move.</p>

  <p>On the floor that Jean had scrubbed till it was so white, a man lay dead,
  stretched upon his back. His eyes stared vacantly straight up at the ceiling,
  where a single cobweb which Jean had not noticed swayed in the air-current
  Lite set in motion with the opening of the door. On the floor, where it had
  dropped from his hand perhaps when he fell, a small square piece of
  gingerbread lay, crumbled around the edges. Tragic halo around his head, a
  pool of blood was turning brown and clotted. Lite shivered a little while he
  stared down at him.</p>

  <p>In a minute he lifted his eyes from the figure and looked around the small
  room. The stove shone black in the sunlight which the open door let in. On
  the table, covered with white oilcloth, the loaf of gingerbread lay
  uncovered, and beside it lay a knife used to cut off the piece which the man
  on the floor had not eaten before he died. Nothing else was disturbed.
  Nothing else seemed in the least to bear any evidence of what had taken
  place.</p>

  <p>Lite's thoughts turned in spite of him to the man who had ridden from the
  coulee as though fiends had pursued. The conclusion was obvious, yet Lite
  loyally rejected it in the face of reason. Reason told him that there went
  the slayer. For this dead man was what was left of Johnny Croft, the Crofty
  of whom Jim had gossiped not more than half an hour before. And the gossip
  had been of threats which Johnny Croft had made against the two Douglas
  brothers,&mdash;big Aleck, of the Lazy A, and Carl, of the Bar Nothing ranch
  adjoining.</p>

  <p>Suicide it could scarcely be, for Crofty was the type of man who would
  cling to life; besides, his gun was in its holster, and a man would hardly
  have the strength or the desire to put away his gun after he has shot himself
  under one eye. Death had undoubtedly been immediate. Lite thought of these
  things while he stood there just inside the door. Then he turned slowly and
  went outside, and stood hesitating upon the porch. He did not quite know what
  he ought to do about it, and so he did not mean to be in too great a hurry to
  do anything; that was Lite's habit, and he had always found that it served
  him well.</p>

  <p>If the rider had been fleeing from his crime, as was likely, Lite had no
  mind to raise at once the hue and cry. An hour or two could make no
  difference to the dead man,&mdash;and you must remember that Lite had for six
  years called this place his home, and big Aleck Douglas his friend as well as
  the man who paid him wages for the work he did. He was half tempted to ride
  away and say nothing for a while. He could let it appear that he had not been
  at the house at all and so had not discovered the crime when he did. That
  would give Aleck Douglas more time to get away. But there was Jean, due at
  any moment now. He could not go away and let Jean discover that gruesome
  thing on the kitchen floor. He could not take it up and hide it away
  somewhere; he could not do anything, it seemed to him, but just wait.</p>

  <p>He went slowly down the path to the stable, his chin on his chest, his
  mind grappling with the tragedy and with the problem of how best he might
  lighten the blow that had fallen upon the ranch. It was unreal,&mdash;it was
  unthinkable,&mdash;that Aleck Douglas, the man who met but friendly glances,
  ride where he might, had done this thing. And yet there was nothing else to
  believe. Johnny Croft had worked here on the ranch for a couple of months,
  off and on. He had not been steadily employed, and he had been paid by the
  day instead of by the month as was the custom. He had worked also for Carl
  Douglas at the Bar Nothing; back and forth, for one or the other as work
  pressed. He was too erratic to be depended upon except from day to day; too
  prone to saddle his horse and ride to town and forget to return for a day or
  two days or a week, as the mood seized him or his money held out.</p>

  <p>Lite knew that there had been some dispute when he had left; he had
  claimed payment for more days than he had worked. Aleck was a just man who
  paid honestly what he owed; he was also known to be "close- fisted." He would
  pay what he owed and not a nickel more,&mdash;hence the dispute. Johnny had
  gone away seeming satisfied that his own figures were wrong, but later on he
  had quarreled with Carl over wages and other things. Carl had a bad temper
  that sometimes got beyond his control, and he had ordered Johnny off the
  ranch. This was part of the long, full-detailed story Jim had been telling.
  Johnny had left, and he had talked about the Douglas brothers to any one who
  would listen. He had said they were crooked, both of them, and would cheat a
  working-man out of his pay. He had come back, evidently, to renew the
  argument with Aleck. With the easy ways of ranch people, he had gone inside
  when he found no one at home,&mdash; hungry, probably, and not at all
  backward about helping himself to whatever appealed to his appetite. That was
  Johnny's way,&mdash;a way that went unquestioned, since he had lived there
  long enough to feel at home. Lite remembered with an odd feeling of pity how
  Johnny had praised the first gingerbread which Jean had baked, the day after
  her arrival; and how he had eaten three pieces and had made Jean's cheeks
  burn with confusion at his bold flattery.</p>

  <p>He had come back, and he had helped himself to the gingerbread. And then
  he had been shot down. He was lying in there now, just as he had fallen, and
  his blood was staining deep the fresh-scrubbed floor. And Jean would be
  coming home soon. Lite thought it would be better if he rode out to meet her,
  and told her what had happened, so that she need not come upon it unprepared.
  There was nothing else that he could bring himself to do, and his mood
  demanded action of some sort; one could not sit down at peace with a fresh
  tragedy like that hanging over the place.</p>

  <p>He had reached the stable when a horse walked out from behind the hay
  corral and stopped, eyeing him curiously. It was Johnny's horse. Even as
  improvident a cowpuncher as Johnny Croft had been likes to own a "private"
  horse,&mdash;one that is his own and can be ridden when and where the owner
  chooses. Lite turned and went over to it, caught it by the dragging
  bridle-reins, and led it into an empty stall. He did not know whether he
  ought to unsaddle it or leave it as it was; but on second thought, he
  loosened the cinch in kindness to the animal, and took off its bridle, so
  that it could eat without being hampered by the bit. Lite was too thorough a
  horseman not to be thoughtful of an animal's comfort.</p>

  <p>He led his own horse out, and then he stopped abruptly. For Pard stood in
  front of the kitchen door, and Jean was untying a package or two from the
  saddle. He opened his mouth to call to her; he started forward; but he was
  too late to prevent what happened. Before his throat had made a sound, Jean
  turned with the packages in the hollow of her arm and stepped upon the
  platform with that springy haste of movement which belongs to health and
  youth and happiness; and before he had taken more than the first step away
  from his horse, she had opened the kitchen door.</p>

  <p>Lite ran, then. He did not call to her. What was the use? She had seen.
  She had dropped her packages, and turned and ran to meet him, and caught him
  by the arm in a panic of horror. Lite patted her hand awkwardly, not knowing
  what he ought to say.</p>

  <p>"What made you go in there?" came of its own accord from his lips. "That's
  no place for a girl."</p>

  <p>"It's Johnny Croft!" she gasped just above her breath. "How&mdash;did it
  happen, Lite?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Lite slowly, looking down and still patting her hand.
  "Your father and I have both been gone all day. I just got back a few minutes
  ago and found out about it." His tone, his manner and his words impressed
  upon Jean the point he wanted her to get,&mdash;that her father had not yet
  returned, and so knew nothing of the crime.</p>

  <p>He led her back to where Pard stood, and told her to get on. Without
  asking him why, Jean obeyed him, with a shudder when her wide eyes strayed
  fascinated to the open door and to what lay just within. Lite went up and
  pulled the door shut, and then, walking beside her with an arm over Pard's
  neck, he led the way down to the stable, and mounted Ranger.</p>

  <p>"You can't stay here," he explained, when she looked at him inquiringly.
  "Do you want to go over and stay at Carl's, or would you rather go back to
  town?" He rode down toward the gate, and Jean kept beside him.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to stay with dad," she told him shakily. "If he stays,
  I'll&mdash;I'll stay."</p>

  <p>"You'll not stay," he contradicted her bluntly. "You can't. It wouldn't be
  right." And he added self-reproachfully: "I never thought of your cutting
  across the bench and riding down the trail back of the house. I meant to head
  you off&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's shorter," said Jean briefly. "I&mdash;if I can't stay, I'd rather go
  to town, Lite. I don't like to stay over at Uncle Carl's."</p>

  <p>Therefore, when they reached the mouth of the coulee, Lite turned into the
  trail that led to town. All down the coulee the trail had been dug deep with
  the hoofprints of a galloping horse; and now, on the town trail, they were as
  plain as a primer to one schooled in the open. But Jean was too upset to
  notice them, and for that Lite was thankful. They did not talk much, beyond
  the commonplace speculations which tragedy always brings to the lips of the
  bystanders. Comments that were perfectly obvious they made, it is true. Jean
  said it was perfectly awful, and Lite agreed with her. Jean wondered how it
  could have happened, and Lite said he didn't know. Neither of them said
  anything about the effect it would have upon their future; I don't suppose
  that Jean, at least, could remotely guess at the effect. It is certain that
  Lite preferred not to do so.</p>

  <p>They were no more than half way to town when they met a group of galloping
  horsemen, their coming heralded for a mile by the dust they kicked out of the
  trail.</p>

  <p>In the midst rode Jean's father. Alongside him rode the coroner, and
  behind him rode the sheriff. The rest of the company was made up of men who
  had heard the news and were coming to look upon the tragedy. Lite drew a long
  breath of relief. Aleck Douglas, then, had not been running away.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2">II. &mdash; CONCERNING LITE AND A FEW FOOTPRINTS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"LUCKY you was with me all day, up to four o'clock, Lite,"
  Jim said. "That lets you out slick and clean, seeing the doctor claims he'd
  been dead six hours when he seen him last night. Crofty&mdash;why, Crofty was
  laying in there dead when I was talking about him to you! Kinda gives a man
  the creeps to think of it. Who do you reckon done it, Lite?"</p>

  <p>"How'n hell do <i>I</i> know?" Lite retorted irritably. "I didn't see it
  done."</p>

  <p>Jim studied awhile, an ear cocked for the signal that the coroner was
  ready to begin the inquest. "Say," he leaned over and whispered in Lite's
  ear, "where was Aleck at, all day yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"Riding over in the bend, looking for black-leg signs," said Lite
  promptly. "Packed a lunch, same as I did."</p>

  <p>The answer seemed to satisfy Jim and to eliminate from his mind any slight
  suspicion he may have held, but Lite had a sudden impulse to improve upon his
  statement.</p>

  <p>"I saw Aleck ride into the ranch as I was coming home," he said. As he
  spoke, his face lightened as with a weight lifted from his mind.</p>

  <p>Later, when the coroner questioned him about his movements and the
  movements of Aleck, Lite repeated the lie as casually as possible. It might
  have carried more weight with the jury if Aleck Douglas himself had not
  testified, just before then, that he had returned about three o'clock to the
  ranch and pottered around the corral with the mare and colt, and unsaddled
  his horse before going into the house at all. It was only when he had
  discovered Johnny Croft's horse at the haystack, he said, that he began to
  wonder where the rider could be. He had gone to the house&mdash;and found him
  on the kitchen floor.</p>

  <p>Lite had not heard this statement, for the simple reason that, being a
  closely interested person, he had been invited to remain outside while Aleck
  Douglas testified. He wondered why the jury,&mdash;men whom he knew and had
  known for years, most of them,&mdash; looked at one another so queerly when
  he declared that he had seen Aleck ride home. The coroner also had given him
  a queer look, but he had not made any comment. Aleck, too, had turned his
  head and stared at Lite in a way which Lite preferred to think he had not
  understood.</p>

  <p>Beyond that one statement which had produced such a curious effect, Lite
  did not have anything to say that shed the faintest light upon the matter. He
  told where he had been, and that he had discovered the body just before Jean
  arrived, and that he had immediately started with her to town. The coroner
  did not cross- question him. Counting from four o'clock, which Jim had
  already named as the time of their separation, Lite would have had just about
  time to do the things he testified to doing. The only thing he claimed to
  have done and could not possibly have done, was to see Aleck Douglas riding
  into the coulee. Aleck himself had branded that a lie before Lite had ever
  uttered it.</p>

  <p>The result was just what was to be expected. Aleck Douglas was placed
  under arrest, and as a prisoner he rode back to town alongside the
  sheriff,&mdash;an old friend of his, by the way,&mdash;to where Jean waited
  impatiently for news.</p>

  <p>It was Lite who told her. "It'll come out all right," he said, in his calm
  way that might hide a good deal of emotion beneath it. "It's just to have
  something to work from,&mdash;don't mean anything in particular. It's a funny
  way the law has got," he explained, "of arresting the last man that saw a
  fellow alive, or the first one that sees him dead."</p>

  <p>Jean studied this explanation dolefully. "They ought to find out the last
  one that saw him alive," she said resentfully, "and arrest him,
  then,&mdash;and leave dad out of it. There's no sense in the law, if that's
  the way it works."</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't make the law," Lite observed, in a tone that made Jean
  look up curiously into his face.</p>

  <p>"Why don't they find out who saw him last?" she repeated. "Somebody did.
  Somebody must have gone there with him. Lite, do you know that Art Osgood
  came into town with his horse all in a lather of sweat, and took the
  afternoon train yesterday? I saw him. I met him square in the middle of the
  street, and he didn't even look at me. He was in a frightful hurry, and he
  looked all upset. If I was the law, I'd leave dad alone and get after Art
  Osgood. He acted to me," she added viciously, "exactly as if he were running
  away!"</p>

  <p>"He wasn't, though. Jim told me Art was going to leave yesterday; that was
  in the forenoon. He's going to Alaska,&mdash;been planning it all spring. And
  Carl said he was with Art till Art left to catch the train. Somebody else
  from town here had seen him take the train, and asked about him. No, it
  wasn't Art."</p>

  <p>"Well, who was it, then?"</p>

  <p>Never before had Lite failed to tell Jean just what she wanted to know. He
  failed now, and he went away as though he was glad to put distance between
  them. He did not know what to think. He did not want to think. Certainly he
  did not want to talk, to Jean especially. For lies never came easily to the
  tongue of Lite Avery. It was all very well to tell Jean that he didn't know
  who it was; he did tell her so, and made his escape before she could read in
  his face the fear that he did know. It was not so easy to guard his fear from
  the keen eyes of his fellows, with whom he must mingle and discuss the
  murder, or else pay the penalty of having them suspect that he knew a great
  deal more about it than he admitted.</p>

  <p>Several men tried to stop him and talk about it, but he put them off. He
  was due at the ranch, he said, to look after the stock. He didn't know a
  thing about it, anyway.</p>

  <p>Lazy A coulee, when he rode into it, seemed to wear already an air of
  depression, foretaste of what was to come. The trail was filled with
  hoofprints, and cut deep with the wagon that had borne the dead man to town
  and to an unwept burial. At the gate he met Carl Douglas, riding with his
  head sunk deep on his chest. Lite would have avoided that meeting if he could
  have done so unobtrusively, but as it was, he pulled up and waited while Carl
  opened the wire gate and dragged it to one side. From the look of his face,
  Carl also would have avoided the meeting, if he could have done so. He
  glanced up as Lite passed through.</p>

  <p>"Hell of a verdict," Lite made brief comment when he met Carl's eyes.</p>

  <p>Carl stopped, leaning against his horse with one hand thrown up to the
  saddle-horn. He was a small man, not at all like Aleck in size or in
  features. He looked haggard now and white.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it?" he asked Lite. "Do you believe&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I don't! Great question for a brother to ask," Lite retorted
  sharply. "It's not in Aleck to do a thing like that."</p>

  <p>"What made you say you saw him ride home? You didn't, did you?"</p>

  <p>"You heard what I said; take it or leave it." Lite scowled down at Carl.
  "What was there queer about it? Why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you'd been inside ten minutes before then," Carl told him bluntly,
  "you'd have heard Aleck say he came home a full hour or more before you say
  you saw him ride in. That's what's queer. What made you do that? It won't
  help Aleck none."</p>

  <p>"Well, what are you going to do about it?" Lite slouched miserably in the
  saddle, and eyed the other without really seeing him at all. "They can't
  prove anything on Aleck," he added with faint hope.</p>

  <p>"I don't see myself how they can." Carl brightened perceptibly. "His being
  alone all day is bad; he can't furnish the alibi you can furnish. But they
  can't prove anything. They'll turn him loose, the grand jury will; they'll
  have to. They can't indict him on the evidence. They haven't got any
  evidence,&mdash;not any more than just the fact that he rode in with the
  news. No need to worry; he'll be turned loose in a few days." He picked up
  the gate, dragged it after him as he went through, and fumbled the wire loop
  into place over the post. "I wish," he said when he had mounted with the gate
  between them, "you hadn't been so particular to say you saw him ride home
  about the same time you did. That looks bad, Lite."</p>

  <p>"Bad for who?" Lite turned in the saddle aggressively.</p>

  <p>"Looks bad all around. I don't see what made you do that;&mdash;not when
  you knew Jim and Aleck had both testified before you did."</p>

  <p>Lite rode slowly down the road to the stable, and cursed the impulse that
  had made him blunder so. He had no compunctions for the lie, if only it had
  done any good. It had done harm; he could see now that it had. But he could
  not believe that it would make any material difference in Aleck's case. As
  the story had been repeated to Lite by half a dozen men, who had heard him
  tell it, Aleck's own testimony had been responsible for the verdict.</p>

  <p>Men had told Lite plainly that Aleck was a fool not to plead self-defense,
  even in face of the fact that Johnny Croft had not drawn any weapon. Jim had
  declared that Aleck could have sworn that Johnny reached for his gun. Others
  admitted voluntarily that while it would be a pretty weak defense, it would
  beat the story Aleck had told.</p>

  <p>Lite turned the mare and colt into a shed for the night. He milked the two
  cows without giving any thought to what he was doing, and carried the milk to
  the kitchen door before he realized that it would be wasted, sitting in pans
  when the house would be empty. Still, it occurred to him that he might as
  well go on with the routine of the place until they knew to a certainty what
  the grand jury would do. So he went in and put away the milk.</p>

  <p>After that, Lite let other work wait while he cleaned the kitchen and
  tried to wash out that brown stain on the floor. His face was moody, his eyes
  dull with trouble. Like a treadmill, his mind went over and over the meager
  knowledge he had of the tragedy. He could not bring himself to believe Aleck
  Douglas guilty of the murder; yet he could not believe anything else.</p>

  <p>Johnny Croft, it had been proven at the inquest, rode out from town alone,
  bent on mischief, if vague, half-drunken threats meant anything. He had told
  more than one that he was going to the Lazy A, but it was certain that no one
  had followed him from town. His threats had been for the most part directed
  against Carl, it is true; but if he had meant to quarrel with Carl, he would
  have gone to the Bar Nothing instead of the Lazy A. Probably he had meant to
  see both Carl and Aleck, and had come here first, since it was the nearest to
  town.</p>

  <p>As to enemies, no one had particularly liked Johnny. He was not a likeable
  sort; he was too "mouthy" according to his associates. He had quarreled with
  a good many for slight cause, but since he was so notoriously blatant and
  argumentative, no one had taken him seriously enough to nurse any grudge that
  would be likely to breed assassination. It was inconceivable to Lite that any
  man had trailed Johnny Croft to the Lazy A and shot him down in the kitchen
  while he was calmly helping himself to Jean's gingerbread. Still, he must
  take that for granted or else believe what he steadfastly refused to confess
  even to himself that he believed.</p>

  <p>It was nearly dark when he threw out the last pail of water and stood
  looking down dissatisfied at the result of his labor, while he dried his
  hands. The stain was still there, in spite of him, just as the memory of the
  murder would cling always to the place. He went out and watered Jean's
  poppies and sweet peas and pansies, still going over and over the evidence
  and trying to fill in the gaps.</p>

  <p>He had blundered with his lie that had meant to help. The lie had proven
  to every man who heard him utter it that his faith in Aleck's innocence was
  not strong; it had proven that he did not trust the facts. That hurt Lite,
  and made it seem more than ever his task to clear up the matter, if he could.
  If he could not, then he would make amends in whatever way he might.</p>

  <p>Almost as if he were guarding that gruesome room which was empty now and
  silent,&mdash;since the clock had not been wound and had run down,&mdash;he
  sat long upon the narrow platform before the kitchen door and smoked and
  stared straight before him. Once he thought he saw a man move cautiously from
  the corner of the shed where the youngest calf slept beside its mother, He
  had been thinking so deeply of other things that he was not sure, but he went
  down there, his cigarette glowing in the gloom, and stood looking and
  listening.</p>

  <p>He neither saw nor heard anything, and presently he went back to the
  house; but his abstraction was broken by the fancy, so that he did not sit
  down again to smoke and think. He had thought until his brain felt heavy and
  stupid; and the last cigarette he lighted; he threw away, for he had smoked
  until his tongue was sore. He went in and went to bed.</p>

  <p>For a long time he lay awake. Finally he dropped into a sleep so heavy
  that it was nearer to a torpor, and it was the sunlight that awoke him;
  sunlight that was warm in the room and proved how late the morning was. He
  swore in his astonishment and got up hastily, a great deal more optimistic
  than when he had lain down, and hurried out to feed the stock before he
  boiled coffee and fried eggs for himself.</p>

  <p>It was when he went in to cook his belated breakfast that Lite noticed
  something which had no logical explanation. There were footprints on the
  kitchen floor that he had scrubbed so diligently. He stood looking at them,
  much as he had looked at the stain that would not come out, no matter how
  hard he scrubbed. He had not gone in the room after he had pulled the door
  shut and gone off to water Jean's dowers. He was positive upon that point;
  and even if he had gone in, his tracks would scarcely have led straight
  across the room to the cupboard where the table dishes were kept.</p>

  <p>The tracks led to the cupboard, and were muddled confusedly there, as
  though the maker had stood there for some minutes. Lite could not see any
  sense in that. They were very distinct, just as footprints always show
  plainly on clean boards. The floor had evidently been moist still,&mdash;Lite
  had scrubbed man-fashion, with a broom, and had not been very particular
  about drying the floor afterwards. Also he had thrown the water straight out
  from the door, and the fellow must have stepped on the moist sand that clung
  to his boots. In the dark he could not notice that, or see that he had left
  tracks on the floor.</p>

  <p>Lite went to the cupboard and looked inside it, wondering what the man
  could have wanted there. It was one of those old-fashioned "safes" such as
  our grandmothers considered indispensable in the furnishing of a kitchen. It
  held the table dishes neatly piled: dinner plates at the end of the middle
  shelf, smaller plates next, then a stack of saucers,&mdash;the arrangement
  stereotyped, unvarying since first Lite Avery had taken dishtowel in hand to
  dry the dishes for Jean when she was ten and stood upon a footstool so that
  her elbows would be higher than the rim of the dishpan. The cherry- blossom
  dinner set that had come from the mail-order house long ago was chipped now
  and incomplete, but the familiar rows gave Lite an odd sense of the unreality
  of the tragedy that had so lately taken place in that room.</p>

  <p>Clearly there was nothing there to tempt a thief, and there was nothing
  disturbed. Lite straightened up and looked down thoughtfully upon the top of
  the cupboard, where Jean had stacked out-of-date newspapers and magazines,
  and where Aleck had laid a pair of extra gloves. He pulled out the two small
  drawers just under the cupboard top and looked within them. The first held
  pipes and sacks of tobacco and books of cigarette papers; Lite knew well
  enough the contents of that drawer. He appraised the supply of tobacco,
  remembered how much had been there on the morning of the murder, and decided
  that none had been taken. He helped himself to a fresh ten-cent sack of
  tobacco and inspected the other drawer.</p>

  <p>Here were merchants' bills, a few letters of no consequence, a couple of
  writing tablets, two lead pencils, and a steel pen and a squat bottle of ink.
  This was called the writing-drawer, and had been since Lite first came to the
  ranch. Here Lite believed the confusion was recent. Jean had been very
  domestic since her return from school, and all disorder had been frowned
  upon. Lately the letters had been stacked in a corner, whereas now they were
  scattered. But they were of no consequence, once they had been read, and
  there was nothing else to merit attention from any one.</p>

  <p>Lite looked down at the tracks and saw that they led into another room,
  which was Aleck's bedroom. He went in there, but he could not find any reason
  for a night-prowler's visit. Aleck's desk was always open. There was never
  anything there which he wanted to hide away. His account books and his
  business correspondence, such as it was, lay accessible to the curious. There
  was nothing intricate or secret about the running of the Lazy A ranch;
  nothing that should interest any one save the owner.</p>

  <p>It occurred to Lite that incriminating evidence is sometimes placed
  surreptitiously in a suspected man's desk. He had heard of such things being
  done. He could not imagine what evidence might be placed here by any one, but
  he made a thorough search. He did not find anything that remotely concerned
  the murder.</p>

  <p>He looked through the living-room, and even opened the door which led from
  the kitchen into Jean's room, which had been built on to the rest of the
  house a few years before. He could not find any excuse for those
  footprints.</p>

  <p>He cooked and ate his breakfast absent-mindedly, glancing often down at
  the footprints on the floor, and occasionally at the brown stain in the
  center. He decided that he would not say anything about those tracks. He
  would keep his eyes open and his mouth shut, and see what came of it.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3">III. &mdash; WHAT A MAN'S GOOD NAME IS WORTH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">YOU would think that the bare word of a man who has lived
  uprightly in a community for fifteen years or so would be believed under
  oath, even if his whole future did depend upon it. You would think that Aleck
  Douglas could not be convicted of murder just because he had reported that a
  man was shot down in Aleck's house.</p>

  <p>The report of Aleck Douglas' trial is not the main feature of this story;
  it is merely the commencement, one might say. Therefore, I am going to be
  brief as I can and still give you a clear idea of the situation, and then I
  am going to skip the next three years and begin where the real story
  begins.</p>

  <p>Aleck's position was dishearteningly simple, and there was nothing much
  that one could do to soften the facts or throw a new light on the murder.
  Lite watched, wide awake and eager, many a night for the return of that
  prowler, but he never saw or heard a thing that gave him any clue whatever.
  So the footprints seemed likely to remain the mystery they had seemed on the
  morning when he discovered them. He laid traps, pretending to ride away from
  the ranch to town before dark, and returning cautiously by way of the trail
  down the bluff behind the house. But nothing came of it. Lazy A ranch was
  keeping its secret well, and by the time the trial was begun, Lite had given
  up hope. Once he believed the house had been visited in the daytime, during
  his absence in town, but he could not be sure of that.</p>

  <p>Jean went to Chinook and stayed there, so that Lite saw her seldom. Carl
  also was away much of the time, trying by every means he could think of to
  swing public opinion and the evidence in Aleck's favor. He prevailed upon
  Rossman, who was Montana's best-known lawyer, to defend the case, for one
  thing. He seemed to pin his faith almost wholly upon Rossman, and declared to
  every one that Aleck would never be convicted. It would be, he maintained,
  impossible to convict him, with Rossman handling the case; and he always
  added the statement that you can't send an innocent man to jail, if things
  are handled right.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he did not, after all, handle things right. For in spite of
  Rossman, and Aleck's splendid reputation, and the meager evidence against
  him, he was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to eight years in Deer
  Lodge penitentiary.</p>

  <p>Rossman had made a great speech, and had made men in the jury blink back
  unshed tears. But he could not shake from them the belief that Aleck Douglas
  had ridden home and met Johnny Croft, calmly making himself at home in the
  Lazy A kitchen. He could not convince them that there had not been a quarrel,
  and that Aleck had not fired the shot in the grip of a sudden, overwhelming
  rage against Croft. By Aleck's own statement he had been at the ranch some
  time before he had started for town to report the murder. By the word of
  several witnesses, it had been proven that Croft had left town meaning to
  collect wages which he claimed were due him or else he would "get even." His
  last words to a group out by the hitching pole in front of the saloon which
  was Johnny's hangout, were: "I'm going to get what's coming to me, or
  there'll be one fine, large bunch of trouble!" He had not mentioned Aleck
  Douglas by name, it is true; but the fact that he had been found at the Lazy
  A was proof enough that he had referred to Aleck when he spoke.</p>

  <p>There is no means of knowing just how far-reaching was the effect of that
  impulsive lie which Lite had told at the inquest. He did not repeat the
  blunder at the trial. When the district attorney reminded Lite of the
  statement he had made, Lite had calmly explained that he had made a mistake;
  he should have said that he had seen Aleck ride away from the ranch instead
  of to it. Beyond that he would not go, question him as they might.</p>

  <p>The judge sentenced Aleck to eight years, and publicly regretted the fact
  that Aleck had persisted in asserting his innocence; had he pleaded guilty
  instead, the judge more than hinted, the sentence would have been made as
  light as the law would permit. It was the stubborn denial of the deed in the
  face of all reason, he said, that went far toward weaning from the prisoner
  what sympathy he would otherwise have commanded from the public and the court
  of justice.</p>

  <p>You know how those things go. There was nothing particularly out of the
  ordinary in the case; we read of such things in the paper, and a paragraph or
  two is considered sufficient space to give so commonplace a happening.</p>

  <p>But there was Lite, loyal to his last breath in the face of his secret
  belief that Aleck was probably guilty; loyal and blaming himself bitterly for
  hurting Aleck's cause when he had meant only to help. There was Jean, dazed
  by the magnitude of the catastrophe that had overtaken them all; clinging to
  Lite as to the only part of her home that was left to her, steadfastly
  refusing to believe that they would actually take her dad away to prison,
  until the very last minute when she stood on the crowded depot platform and
  watched in dry-eyed misery while the train slid away and bore him out of her
  life. These things are not put in the papers.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Jean." Lite took her by the arm and swung her away from the
  curious crowd which she did not see. "You're my girl now, and I'm going to
  start right in using my authority. I've got Pard here in the stable. You go
  climb into your riding-clothes, and we'll hit it outa this darned burg where
  every man and his dog has all gone to eyes and tongues. They make me sick.
  Come on."</p>

  <p>"Where?" Jean held back a little with vague stubbornness against the
  thought of taking up life again without her dad. "This&mdash;this is the
  jumping-off place, Lite. There's nothing beyond."</p>

  <p>Lite gripped her arm a little tighter if anything, and led her across the
  street and down the high sidewalk that bridged a swampy tract at the edge of
  town beyond the depot.</p>

  <p>"We're taking the long way round," he observed "because I'm going to talk
  to you like a Dutch uncle for saying things like that. I&mdash;had a talk
  with your dad last night, Jean. He's turned you over to me to look after till
  he gets back. I wish he coulda turned the ranch over, along with you, but he
  couldn't. That's been signed over to Carl, somehow; I didn't go into that
  with your dad; we didn't have much time. Seems Carl put up the money to pay
  Rossman,&mdash;and other things,&mdash;and took over the ranch to square it.
  Anyway, I haven't got anything to say about the business end of the deal.
  I've got permission to boss you, though, and I'm sure going to do it to a
  fare-you-well." He cast a sidelong glance down at her. He could not see
  anything of her face except the droop of her mouth, a bit of her cheek, and
  her chin that promised firmness. Her mouth did not change expression in the
  slightest degree until she moved her lips in speech.</p>

  <p>"I don't care. What is there to boss me about? The world has stopped." Her
  voice was steady, and it was also sullen.</p>

  <p>"Right there is where the need of bossing begins. You can't stay in town
  any longer. There's nothing here to keep you from going crazy; and the Allens
  are altogether too sympathetic; nice folks, and they mean well,&mdash;but you
  don't want a bunch like that slopping around, crying all over you and keeping
  you in mind of things. I'm going to work for Carl, from now on. You're going
  out there to the Bar Nothing&mdash;" He felt a stiffening of the muscles
  under his fingers, and answered calmly the signal of rebellion.</p>

  <p>"Sure, that's the place for you. Your dad and Carl fixed that up between
  them, anyway. That's to be your home; so my saying so is just an extra rope
  to bring you along peaceable. You're going to stay at the Bar Nothing. And
  I'm going to make a top hand outa you, Jean. I'm going to teach you to shoot
  and rope and punch cows and ride, till there won't be a girl in the United
  States to equal you."</p>

  <p>"What for?" Jean still had an air of sullen apathy. "That won't help dad
  any."</p>

  <p>"It'll start the world moving again." Lite forced himself to cheerfulness
  in the face of his own despondency. "You say it's stopped. It's us that have
  stopped. We've come to a blind pocket, you might say, in the trail we've been
  taking through life. We've got to start in a new place, that's all. Now, I
  know you're dead game, Jean; at least I know you used to be, and I'm gambling
  on school not taking that outa you. You're maybe thinking about going away
  off somewhere among strangers; but that wouldn't do at all. Your dad always
  counted on keeping you away from town life. I'm just going to ride herd on
  you, Jean, and see to it that you go on the way your dad wanted you to go. He
  can't be on the job, and so I'm what you might call his foreman. I know how
  he wants you to grow up; I'm going to make it my business to grow you
  according to directions."</p>

  <p>He saw a little quirk of her lips, at that, and was vastly encouraged
  thereby.</p>

  <p>"Has it struck you that you're liable to have your hands full?" she asked
  him with a certain drawl that Jean had possessed since she first learned to
  express herself in words.</p>

  <p>"Sure! I'll likely have both hand and my hat full of trouble. But she's
  going to be done according to contract. I reckon I'll wish you was a bronk
  before I'm through&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What maddens me so that I could run amuck down this street, shooting
  everybody I saw," Jean flared out suddenly, "is the sickening injustice of
  it. Dad never did that; you know he never did it." She turned upon him
  fiercely. "Do you think he did?" she demanded, her eyes boring into his.</p>

  <p>"Now, that's a bright question to be asking me, ain't it?" Lite rebuked.
  "That's a real bright, sensible question, I must say! I reckon you ought to
  be stood in the corner for that,&mdash;but I'll let it go this time. Only
  don't never spring anything like that again."</p>

  <p>Jean looked ashamed. "I could doubt God Himself, right now," she gritted
  through her teeth.</p>

  <p>"Well, don't doubt me, unless you want a scrap on your hands," Lite
  warned. "I'm sure ashamed of you. We'll stop here at the stable and get the
  horses. You can ride sideways as far as the Allens', and get your
  riding-skirt and come on. The sooner you are on top of a horse, the quicker
  you're going to come outa that state of mind."</p>

  <p>It was pitifully amusing to see Lite Avery attempt to bully any
  one,&mdash;especially Jean,&mdash;who might almost be called Lite's religion.
  The idea of that long, lank cowpuncher whose shyness was so ingrained that it
  had every outward appearance of being a phlegmatic coldness, assuming the
  duties of Jean's dad and undertaking to see that she grew up according to
  directions, would have been funny, if he had not been so absolutely in
  earnest.</p>

  <p>His method of comforting her and easing her through the first stage of
  black despair was unorthodox, but it was effective. Because she was too
  absorbed in her own misery to combat him openly, he got her started toward
  the Bar Nothing and away from the friends whose enervating pity was at that
  time the worst influence possible. He set the pace, and he set it for speed.
  The first mile they went at a sharp gallop that was not far from a run, and
  the horses were breathing heavily when he pulled up, well out of sight of the
  town, and turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>There was color in her cheeks, and the dullness was gone from her eyes
  when she returned his glance inquiringly. The droop of her lips was no longer
  the droop of a weak yielding to sorrow, but rather the beginning of a brave
  facing of the future. Lite managed a grin that did not look forced.</p>

  <p>"I'll make a real range hand outa you yet," he announced confidently. "You
  remember the roping and shooting science I taught you before you went off to
  school? You're going to start right in where you left off and learn all I
  know and some besides. I'll make a lady of you yet,&mdash;darned if I
  don't."</p>

  <p>At that Jean laughed unexpectedly. Lite drew a long breath of relief.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4">IV. &mdash; JEAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE still loneliness of desertion held fast the clutter of
  sheds and old stables roofed with dirt and rotting hay. The melancholy of
  emptiness hung like an invisible curtain before the sprawling house with
  warped, weather-blackened shingles, and sagging window-frames. You felt the
  silence when first you sighted the ranch buildings from the broad mouth of
  the Lazy A coulee,&mdash;the broad mouth that yawned always at the narrow
  valley and the undulations of the open range, and the purple line of
  mountains beyond. You felt it more strongly when you rode up to the gate of
  barbed-wire, spliced here and there, and having an unexpected stubbornness to
  harry the patience of men who would pass through it in haste. You grew
  unaccountably depressed if you rode on past the stables and corrals to the
  house, where the door was closed but never locked, and opened with a squeal
  of rusty hinges, if you turned the brown earthenware knob and at the same
  instant pressed sharply with your knee against the paintless panel.</p>

  <p>You might notice the brown spot on the kitchen door where a man had died;
  you might notice the brown spot, but unless you had been told the grim story
  of the Lazy A, you would never guess the spot was a bloodstain. Even though
  you guessed and shuddered, you would forget it presently in the amazement
  with which you opened the door beyond and looked in upon a room where the
  chill atmosphere of the whole place could find no lodgment.</p>

  <p>This was Jean's room, held sacred to her own needs and uses, in defiance
  of the dreariness that compassed it close. A square of old rag carpet covered
  the center of the floor, and beyond its border the warped boards were painted
  a dull, pale green. The walls were ugly with a cheap, flowered paper that had
  done its best to fade into inoffensive neutral tints. Jean had helped, where
  she could, by covering the intricate rose pattern with old prints cut from
  magazines and with cheap, pretty souvenirs gleaned here and there and hoarded
  jealously. And there were books, which caught the eyes and held them even to
  forgetfulness of the paper.</p>

  <p>You would laugh at Jean's room. Just at first you would laugh; after that
  you would want to cry, or pat Jean on her hard-muscled, capable shoulder; but
  if you knew Jean at all, you would not do either. First you would notice an
  old wooden cradle, painted blue, that stood in a corner. A button-eyed,
  blank-faced rag doll, the size of a baby at the fist-sucking age, was tucked
  neatly under the red-and-white patchwork quilt made to fit the cradle.
  Hanging directly over the cradle by a stirrup was Jean's first
  saddle,&mdash;a cheap pigskin affair with harsh straps and buckles, that her
  father had sent East for. Jean never had liked that saddle, even when it was
  new. She used to stand perfectly still while her father buckled it on the
  little buckskin pony she rode; and she would laugh when he picked her up and
  tossed her into the seat. She would throw her dad a kiss and go galloping off
  down the trail,&mdash;but when she was quite out of sight around the bend of
  the bench-land, she would stop and take the saddle off, and hide it in a
  certain clump of wild currant bushes, and continue her journey bareback. A
  kit-fox found it one day; that is how the edge of the cantle came to have
  that queer, chewed look.</p>

  <p>There was an old, black wooden rocker with an oval picture of a ship under
  full sail, just where Jean's brown head rested when she leaned back and
  stared big-eyed down the coulee to the hills beyond. There was an
  old-fashioned work-basket always full of stockings that never were mended,
  and a crumpled dresser scarf which Jean had begun to hemstitch more than a
  year ago in a brief spasm of domesticity. There were magazines everywhere;
  and you may be sure that Jean had read them all, even to the soap
  advertisements and the sanitary kitchens and the vacuum cleaners. There was
  an old couch with a coarse, Navajo rug thrown over it, and three or four
  bright cushions that looked much used. And there were hair macartas and
  hackamores, and two pairs of her father's old spurs, and her father's stock
  saddle and chaps and slicker and hat; and a jelly glass half full of
  rattlesnake rattles, and her mother's old checked sunbonnet,&mdash;the kind
  with pasteboard "slats." Half the "slats" were broken. There was a guitar and
  an old, old sewing machine with a reloading shotgun outfit spread out upon
  it. There was a desk made of boxes, and on the desk lay a shot-loaded quirt
  that more than one rebellious cow-horse knew to its sorrow. There was a
  rawhide lariat that had parted its strands in a tussle with a stubborn cow.
  Jean meant to fix the broken end of the longest piece and use it for a
  tie-rope, some day when she had time, and thought of it.</p>

  <p>Somewhere in the desk were verses which Jean had written,&mdash;dozens of
  them, and not nearly as bad as you might think. Jean laughed at them after
  they were written; but she never burned them, and she never spoke of them to
  any one but Lite, who listened with fixed attention and a solemn appreciation
  when she read them to him.</p>

  <p>On the whole, the room was contradictory. But Jean herself was somewhat
  contradictory, and the place fitted her. Here was where she spent those hours
  when her absence from the Bar Nothing was left unexplained to any one save
  Lite. Here was where she drew into her shell, when her Uncle Carl made her
  feel more than usually an interloper; or when her Aunt Ella's burden of
  complaints and worry and headaches grew just a little too much for Jean.</p>

  <p>She never opened the door into the kitchen. There was another just beyond
  the sewing-machine, that gave an intimate look into the face of the bluff
  which formed that side of the coulee wall. There were hollyhocks along the
  path that led to this door, and stunted rosebushes which were kept alive with
  much mysterious assistance in the way of water and cultivation. There was a
  little spring just under the foot of the bluff, where the trail began to
  climb; and some young alders made a shady nook there which Jean found
  pleasant on a hot day.</p>

  <p>The rest of the house might be rat-ridden and desolate. The coulee might
  wear always the look of emptiness; but here, under the bluff by the spring,
  and in the room Jean called hers, one felt the air of occupancy that gave the
  lie to all around it.</p>

  <p>When she rode around the bold, out-thrust shoulder of the hill which
  formed the western rim of the coulee, and went loping up the trail to where
  the barbed-wire gate stopped her, you would have said that Jean had not a
  trouble to call her own. She wore her old gray Stetson pretty well over one
  eye because of the sun- glare, and she was riding on one stirrup and letting
  the other foot swing free, and she was whirling her quirt round and round,
  cartwheel fashion, and whistling an air that every one knows,&mdash;and
  putting in certain complicated variations of her own.</p>

  <p>At the gate she dismounted without ever missing a note, gave the warped
  stake a certain twist and jerk which loosened the wire loop so that she could
  slip it easily over the post, passed through and dragged the gate with her,
  dropping it flat upon the ground beside the trail. There was no stock
  anywhere in the coulee, and she would save a little trouble by leaving the
  gate open until she came out on her way home. She stepped aside to inspect
  the meadow lark's nest cunningly hidden under a wild rosebush, and then
  mounted and went on to the stable, still whistling carelessly.</p>

  <p>She turned Pard into the shed where she invariably left him when she came
  to the Lazy A, and went on up the grass-grown path to the house. She had the
  preoccupied air of one who meditates deeply upon things apart; as a matter of
  fact, she had glanced down the coulee to its wide-open mouth, and had
  thrilled briefly at the wordless beauty of the green spread of the plain and
  the hazy blue sweep of the mountains, and had come suddenly into the poetic
  mood. She had even caught a phrase,&mdash;"The lazy line of the watchful
  hills," it was,&mdash;and she was trying to fit it into a verse, and to find
  something beside "rills" that would rhyme with "hills."</p>

  <p>She followed the path absent-mindedly to where she would have to turn at
  the corner of the kitchen and go around to the door of her own room; and
  until she came to the turn she did not realize what was jarring vaguely and
  yet insistently upon her mood. Then she knew; and she stopped full and stared
  down at the loose sand just before the warped kitchen steps. There were
  footprints in the path,&mdash;alien footprints; and they pointed toward that
  forbidden door into the kitchen of gruesome memory. Jean looked up frowning,
  and saw that the door had been opened and closed again carelessly. And upon
  the top step, strange feet had pressed a little caked earth carried from the
  trail where she stood. There were the small-heeled, pointed prints of a
  woman's foot, and there were the larger tracks of a man,&mdash;a man of the
  town.</p>

  <p>Jean stood with her quirt dangling loosely from her wrist and glanced back
  toward the stables and down the coulee. She completely forgot that she wanted
  a rhyme for "hills." What were towns people doing here? And how did they get
  here? They had not ridden up the coulee; there were no tracks through the
  gate; and besides, these were not the prints of riding-boots.</p>

  <p>She twitched her shoulders and went around to the door leading into her
  own room. The door stood wide open when it should have been closed. Inside
  there were evidences of curious inspection. She went hot with an unreasoning
  anger when she saw the wide-open door into the kitchen; first of all she went
  over and closed that door, her lips pressed tightly together. To her it was
  as though some wanton hand had forced up the lid of a coffin where slept her
  dead. She stood with her back against the door and looked around the room,
  breathing quickly. She felt the woman's foolish amusement at the old cradle
  with the rag doll tucked under the patchwork quilt, and at her pitiful
  attempts at adorning the tawdry walls. Without having seen more than the
  prints of her shoes in the path, Jean hated the woman who had blundered in
  here and had looked and laughed. She hated the man who had come with the
  woman.</p>

  <p>She went over to her desk and stood staring at the litter. A couple of
  sheets of cheap tablet paper, whereon Jean had scribbled some verses of the
  range, lay across the quirt she had forgotten on her last trip. They had
  prowled among the papers, even! They had respected nothing of hers, had
  considered nothing sacred from their inquisitiveness. Jean picked up the
  paper and read the verses through, and her cheeks reddened slowly.</p>

  <p>Then she discovered something else that turned them white with fresh
  anger. Jean had an old ledger wherein she kept a sporadic kind of a diary
  which she had entitled "More or Less the Record of my Sins." She did not
  write anything in it unless she felt like doing so; when she did, she wrote
  just exactly what she happened to think and feel at the time, and she had
  never gone back and read what was written there. Some one else had read,
  however; at least the book had been pulled out of its place and inspected,
  along with her other personal belongings. Jean had pressed the first
  wind-flowers of the season between the pages where she had done her last
  scribbling, and these were crumpled and two petals broken, so she knew that
  the book had been opened carelessly and perhaps read with that same brainless
  laughter.</p>

  <p>She did not say anything. She straightened the wind-flowers as best she
  could, put the book back where it belonged, and went outside, and down to a
  lop-sided shack which might pass anywhere as a junk-shop. She found some
  nails and a hammer, and after a good deal of rummaging and some sneezing
  because of the dust she raised whenever she moved a pile of rubbish, she
  found a padlock with a key in it. More dusty search produced a hasp and some
  staples, and then she went back and nailed two planks across the door which
  opened into the kitchen. After that she fastened the windows shut with nails
  driven into the casing just above the lower sashes, and cracked the outer
  door with twelve- penny nails which she clinched on the inside with vicious
  blows of the hammer, so that the hasp could not be taken off without a good
  deal of trouble. She had pulled a great staple off the door of a useless
  box-stall, and when she had driven it in so deep that she could scarcely
  force the padlock into place over the hasp, and had put the key in her
  pocket, she felt in a measure protected from future prowlers. As a final
  hint, however, she went back to the shop and mixed some paint with lampblack
  and oil, and lettered a thin board which she afterwards carried up and nailed
  firmly across the outside kitchen door. Hammer in hand she backed away and
  read the words judicially, her head tilted sidewise:</p>
  <pre>
<font face="arial">
    ONLY SNEAKS GO WHERE THEY ARE NOT WANTED.

              ARE YOU A SNEAK?</font>
</pre>

  <p>The hint was plain enough. She took the hammer back to the shop and led
  Pard out of the stable and down to the gate, her eyes watching suspiciously
  the trail for tracks of trespassers. She closed the gate so thoroughly with
  baling wire twisted about a stake that the next comer would have troubles of
  his own in getting it open again. She mounted and went away down the trail,
  sitting straight in the saddle, both feet in the stirrups, head up, and hat
  pulled firmly down to her very eyebrows, glances going here and there, alert,
  antagonistic. No whistling this time of rag-time tunes with queer little
  variations of her own; no twirling of the quirt; instead Pard got the feel of
  it in a tender part of the flank, and went clean over a narrow washout that
  could have been avoided quite easily. No groping for rhythmic phrasings to
  fit the beauty of the land she lived in; Jean was in the mood to combat
  anything that came in her way.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5">V. &mdash; JEAN RIDES INTO A SMALL ADVENTURE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AT the mouth of the coulee, she turned to the left instead
  of to the right, and so galloped directly away from the Bar Nothing ranch,
  down the narrow valley known locally as the Flat, and on to the hills that
  invited her with their untroubled lights and shadows and the deep scars she
  knew for canyons.</p>

  <p>There were no ranches out this way. The land was too broken and too barren
  for anything but grazing, so that she felt fairly sure of having her solitude
  unspoiled by anything human. Solitude was what she wanted. Solitude was what
  she had counted upon having in that little room at the Lazy A; robbed of it
  there, she rode straight to the hills, where she was most certain of finding
  it.</p>

  <p>And then she came up out of a hollow upon a little ridge and saw three
  horsemen down in the next coulee. They were not close enough so that she
  could distinguish their features, but by the horses they rode, by the swing
  of their bodies in the saddles, by all those little, indefinable marks by
  which we recognize acquaintances at a distance, Jean knew them for strangers.
  She pulled up and watched them, puzzled for a minute at their presence and
  behavior.</p>

  <p>When first she discovered them, they were driving a small bunch of cattle,
  mostly cows and calves, down out of a little "draw" to the level bottom of
  the narrow coulee. While she watched, herself screened effectually by a clump
  of bushes, she saw one rider leave the cattle and gallop out into the open,
  stand there looking toward the mouth of the coulee, and wave his hand in a
  signal for the others to advance. This looked queer to Jean, accustomed all
  her life to seeing men go calmly about their business upon the range,
  careless of observation because they had nothing to conceal. She urged Pard a
  little nearer, keeping well behind the bushes still, and leaned forward over
  the saddle horn, watching the men closely.</p>

  <p>Their next performance was enlightening, but incredibly bold for the
  business they were engaged in. One of the three got off his horse and started
  a little fire of dry sticks under a convenient ledge. Another untied the rope
  from his saddle, widened the loop, swung it twice over his head and flipped
  it neatly over the head of a calf.</p>

  <p>Jean did not wait to see any more than that; she did not need to see any
  more to know them for "rustlers." Brazen rustlers, indeed, to go about their
  work in broad daylight like that. She was not sure as to the ownership of the
  calf, but down here was where the Bar Nothing cattle, and what few were left
  of the Lazy A, ranged while the feed was good in the spring, so that the
  probabilities were that this theft would strike rather close home. Whether it
  did or not, Jean was not one to ride away and leave range thieves calmly at
  work.</p>

  <p>She turned back behind the bushy screen, rode hastily along the ridge to
  the head of the little coulee and dismounted, leading Pard down a steep bank
  that was treacherous with loose shale. The coulee was more or less open, but
  it had convenient twists and windings; and if you think that Jean failed to
  go down it quietly and unseen, that merely proves how little you know
  Jean.</p>

  <p>She hurried as much as she dared. She knew that the rustlers would be in
  something of a hurry themselves, and she very much desired to ride on them
  unawares and catch them at that branding, so that there would be no shadow of
  a doubt of their guilt. What she would do after she had ridden upon them, she
  did not quite know.</p>

  <p>So she came presently around the turn that revealed them to her. They were
  still fussing with the calf,&mdash; or it may have been another
  one,&mdash;and did not see her until she was close upon them. When they did
  see her, she had them covered with her 38-caliber six-shooter, that she
  usually carried with her on the chance of getting a shot at a coyote or a fox
  or something like that.</p>

  <p>The three stood up and stared at her, their jaws sagging a little at the
  suddenness of her appearance, and their eyes upon the gun. Jean held it
  steady, and she had all the look of a person who knew exactly what she meant,
  and who meant business. She eyed them curiously, noting the fact that they
  were strangers, and cowboys,&mdash;though of a type that she had never seen
  on the range. She glanced sharply at the beaded, buckskin jacket of one of
  them, and the high, wide-brimmed sombrero of another.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said at length, "turn your backs, you've had a good look at
  me. Turn&mdash;your&mdash;backs, I said. Now, drop those guns on the ground.
  Walk straight ahead of you till you come to that bank. You needn't look
  around; I'm still here."</p>

  <p>She leaned a little, sending Pard slowly forward until he was close to the
  six-shooters lying on the ground. She glanced down at them quickly, and again
  at the men who stood, an uneasy trio, with their faces toward the wall,
  except when they ventured a glance sidewise or back at her over one shoulder.
  She glanced at the cattle huddled in the narrow mouth of the "draw" behind
  them, and saw that they were indeed Bar Nothing and Lazy A stock. The horses
  the three had been riding she did not remember to have seen before.</p>

  <p>Jean hesitated, not quite knowing what she ought to do next. So far she
  had acted merely upon instincts born of her range life and training; the rest
  would not be so easy. She knew she ought to have those guns, at any rate, so
  she dismounted, still keeping the three in line with her own weapon, and went
  to where the revolvers lay on the ground. With her boot toe she kicked them
  close together, and stooped and picked one up. The last man in the line
  turned toward her protestingly, and Jean fired so close to his head that he
  ducked.</p>

  <p>"Believe me, I could kill the three of you if I wanted to, before you
  could turn around," she informed them calmly, "so you had better stand still
  till I tell you to move." She frowned down at the rustler's gun in her hand.
  There was something queer about that gun.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Burns," called the man in the middle, without venturing to turn his
  head, "come out of there and explain to the lady. This ain't in the
  scene!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, it is!" a voice retorted chucklingly. "You bet your life this is
  in the scene! Lowry's been pamming it all in; don't you worry about that!"
  Jean was startled, but she did not lower her gun from its steady aiming at
  the three of them. It was just some trick, very likely, meant to throw her
  off her guard. There were more than the three, and the fourth man probably
  had her covered with a gun. But she would not turn her head toward his voice,
  for all that.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman called Burns may walk out into the open and explain, if he
  can," she announced sharply, her eyes upon the three whom she had captured so
  easily.</p>

  <p>She heard the throaty chuckle again, from somewhere to the left of her.
  She saw the three men in front of her look at each other with sickly grins.
  She felt that the whole situation was swinging against her,&mdash;that she
  had somehow blundered and made herself ridiculous. It never occurred to her
  that she was in any particular danger; men did not shoot down women in that
  country, unless they were drunk or crazy, and the man called Burns had
  sounded extremely sane, humorous even. She heard a rattle of bushes and the
  soft crunching of footsteps coming toward her. Still she would not turn her
  head, nor would she lower the gun; if it was a trick, they should not say
  that it had been successful.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, sister," said the chuckling voice presently, almost at
  her elbow. "This isn't any real, honest-to-John bandit party. We're just
  movie people, and we're making pictures. That's all." He stopped, but Jean
  did not move or make any reply whatever, so he went on. "I must say I
  appreciate the compliment you paid us in taking it for the real dope,
  sister&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't call me sister again." Jean flashed him a sidelong glance of
  resentment. "You've already done it twice too often. Come around in front
  where I can see you, if you're what you claim to be."</p>

  <p>"Well, don't shoot, and I will," soothed the chuckling voice. "My, my, it
  certainly is a treat to see a real, live Prairie Queen once. Beats making
  them to order&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We'll omit the superfluous chatter, please." Jean looked him over and
  tagged him mentally with one glance. He did not look like a
  rustler,&mdash;with his fat good-nature and his town-bred personality, and
  his gray tweed suit and pigskin puttees, and the big cameo ring on his
  manicured little finger, and his fresh-shaven face as round as the sun above
  his head and almost as cheerful. Perfectly harmless, but Jean would not yield
  to the extent of softening her glance or her manner one hundredth of a
  degree. The more harmless these people, the more ridiculous she had made
  herself appear.</p>

  <p>The chuckly one grinned and removed his soft gray hat, held it against his
  generous equator, and bowed so low as to set him puffing a little afterward.
  His eyes, however, appraised her shrewdly.</p>

  <p>"Omitting all superfluous chatter, as you suggest, I am Robert Grant
  Burns, of the Great Western Film Company. These men are also members of that
  company. We are here for the purpose of making Western pictures, and this
  little bit of unlawful branding of stock which you were flattering enough to
  mistake for the real thing, is merely a scene which we were making." He was
  about to indulge in what he would have termed a little "kidding" of the girl,
  but wisely refrained after another shrewd reading of her face.</p>

  <p>Jean looked at the three men, who had taken it for granted that they might
  leave their intimate study of the clay bank and were coming toward her. She
  looked at the gun she had picked up from the ground,&mdash;being loaded with
  blank cartridges was what had made it look so queer!&mdash;and at Robert
  Grant Burns of the Great Western Film Company, who had put on his hat again
  and was studying her the way he was wont to study applicants for a position
  in his company.</p>

  <p>"Did you get permission to haze our cattle around like this?" she asked
  abruptly, to hide how humiliated she really felt.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;no. Just for a few scenes, I did not consider it necessary."
  Plainly, the chuckly Mr. Burns was taken at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>"But it is necessary. Don't make the mistake, Mr. Burns, of thinking this
  country and all it contains is at the disposal of any chance stranger, just
  because we do not keep it under lock and key. You are making rather free with
  another man's personal property, when you use my uncle's cattle for your
  rustling scenes."</p>

  <p>"Your uncle? Well, I shall be very glad to make some arrangement with your
  uncle, if that is customary."</p>

  <p>"Why the doubt? Are you in the habit of walking into a man's house, for
  instance, and using his kitchen to make pictures without permission? Has it
  been your custom to lead a man's horses out of his stable whenever you chose,
  and use them for race pictures?"</p>

  <p>"No, no&mdash;nothing like that. Sorry to have infringed upon your
  property-rights, I am sure." Mr. Burns did not sound so chuckly now; but that
  may have been because the three picture-rustlers were quite openly pleased at
  the predicament of their director. "It never occurred to me that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That the cattle were not as free as the hills?" The quiet voice of Jean
  searched out the tenderest places in the self-esteem of Robert Grant Burns.
  She tossed the blank-loaded gun back upon the ground and turned to her horse.
  "It does seem hard to impress it upon city people that we savages do have a
  few rights in this country. We should have policemen stationed on every
  hilltop, I suppose, and `No Trespassing' signs planted along every cow-trail.
  Even then I doubt whether we could convince some people that we are perfectly
  human and that we actually do own property here."</p>

  <p>While she drawled the last biting sentences, she stuck her toe in the
  stirrup and went up into the saddle as easily as any cowpuncher in the
  country could have done. Robert Grant Burns stood with his hands at his hips
  and watched her with the critical eye of the expert who sees in every gesture
  a picture, effective or ineffective, good, bad, or merely so&mdash;so. Robert
  Grant Burns had never, in all his experience in directing Western pictures,
  seen a girl mount a horse with such unconscious ease of every movement.</p>

  <p>Jean twitched the reins and turned towards him, looking down at the little
  group with unfriendly eyes. "I don't want to seem inhospitable or
  unaccommodating, Mr. Burns," she told him, "but I fear that I must take these
  cattle back home with me. You probably will not want to use them any
  longer."</p>

  <p>Mr. Burns did not say whether she was right or wrong in her conjecture. As
  a matter of fact, he did want to use them for several more scenes; but he
  stood silent while Jean, with a chilly bow to the four of them, sent Pard up
  the rough bank of the little gulley. Rather, he made no reply to Jean, but he
  waved his three rustlers back, retreating himself to where the bank stopped
  them. And he turned toward the bushes that had at first hidden him from Jean,
  waved his hand in an imperative gesture, and called guardedly through cupped
  palms. "Take that! All you can get of it!" Which goes far to show why he was
  considered one of the best directors the Great Western Film Company had in
  its employ.</p>

  <p>So Jean unconsciously made a picture which caused the eyes of Robert Grant
  Burns to glisten while he watched. She ignored the men who had so fooled her,
  and took down her rope that she might swing the loop of it toward the cattle
  and drive them back across the gulley and up the coulee toward home. Cattle
  are stubborn things at best, and this little bunch seemed determined to seek
  the higher slopes. Put upon her mettle because of that little audience down
  below,&mdash; a mildly jeering audience at that, she imagined,&mdash;Jean had
  need of her skill and her fifteen years or so of experience in handling
  stock.</p>

  <p>She swung her rope and shouted, weaving back and forth across the gulley,
  with little lunging rushes now and then to head off an animal that tried to
  bolt past her up the hill. She would not have glanced toward Robert Grant
  Burns to save her life, and she did not hear him saying:</p>

  <p>"Great! Great stuff! Get it all, Pete. By George, you can't beat the real
  thing, can you? 'J get that up-hill dash? Good! Now panoram the drive up the
  gulley&mdash;get it ALL, Pete&mdash;turn as long as you can see the top of
  her hat. My Lord! You wouldn't get stuff like that in ten years. I wish Gay
  could handle herself like that in the saddle, but there ain't a leading woman
  in the business to-day that could put that over the way she's doing it. By
  George! Say, Gil, you get on your horse and ride after her, and find out
  where she lives. We can't work any more now, anyway; she's gone off with the
  cattle. And, say! You don't want to let her get a sight of you, or she might
  take a shot at you. And if she can shoot the way she rides&mdash;good
  night!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6">VI. &mdash; AND THE VILLAIN PURSUED HER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE young man called Gil,&mdash;to avoid wasting time in
  saying Gilbert James Huntley,&mdash; mounted in haste and rode warily up the
  coulee some distance behind Jean. At that time and in that locality he was
  quite anxious that she should not discover him. Gil was not such a bad
  fellow, even though he did play "heavies" in all the pictures which Robert
  Grant Burns directed. A villain he was on the screen, and a bad one. Many's
  the man he had killed as cold- bloodedly as the Board of Censorship would
  permit. Many's the girlish, Western heart he had broken, and many's the time
  he had paid the penalty to brother, father, or sweetheart as the scenario of
  the play might decree. Many's the time he had followed girls and men warily
  through brush-fringed gullies and over picturesque ridges, for the
  entertainment of shop girls and their escorts sitting in darkened theaters
  and watching breathlessly the wicked deeds of Gilbert James Huntley.</p>

  <p>But in his everyday life, Gil Huntley was very good- looking, very
  good-natured, and very harmless. His position and his salary as "heavy" in
  the Great Western Company he owed chiefly to his good acting and his thick
  eyebrows and his facility for making himself look treacherous and mean. He
  followed Jean because the boss told him to do so, in the first place. In the
  second place, he followed her because he was even more interested in her than
  his director had been, and he hoped to have a chance to talk with her. In his
  work- aday life, Gil Huntley was quite accustomed to being discovered in some
  villainy, and to having some man or woman point a gun at him with more or
  less antagonism in voice and manner. But he had never in his life had a girl
  ride up and "throw down on him" with a gun, actually believing him to be a
  thief and a scoundrel whom she would shoot if she thought it necessary. There
  was a difference. Gil did not take the time or trouble to analyze the
  difference, but he knew that he was glad the boss had not sent Johnny or Bill
  in his place. He did not believe that either of them would have enough sense
  to see the difference, and they might offend her in some way,&mdash;though
  Gil Huntley need not have worried in the least over any man's treatment of
  Jean, who was eminently qualified to attend to that for herself.</p>

  <p>He grinned when he saw her turn the cattle loose down the very next coulee
  and with a final flip of her rope loop toward the hindermost cow, ride on
  without them. He should have ridden in haste then to tell Robert Grant Burns
  that the cattle could be brought back in twenty minutes or so and the
  picture-making go on as planned. It was not likely that the girl would come
  back; they could go on with their work and get permission from the girl's
  uncle afterward. But he did not turn and hurry back. Instead, he waited
  behind a rock-huddle until Jean was well out of sight,&mdash; and while he
  waited, he took his handkerchief and rubbed hard at the make-up on his face,
  which had made him look sinister and boldly bad. Without mirror or cold
  cream, he was not very successful, so that he rode on somewhat spotted in
  appearance and looking even more sinister than before. But he was much more
  comfortable in his mind, which meant a good deal in the interview which he
  hoped by some means to bring about.</p>

  <p>With Jean a couple of hundred yards in advance, they crossed a little flat
  so bare of concealment that Gil Huntley was worried for fear she might look
  back and discover him. But she did not turn her head, and he rode on more
  confidently. At the mouth of Lazy A coulee, just where stood the cluster of
  huge rocks that had at one time come hurtling down from the higher slopes,
  and the clump of currant bushes beneath which Jean used to hide her
  much-despised saddle when she was a child, she disappeared from view. Gil,
  knowing very little of the ways of the range folk, and less of the country,
  kicked his horse into a swifter pace and galloped after her.</p>

  <p>Fifty yards beyond the currant bushes he heard a sound and looked back;
  and there was Jean, riding out from her hiding-place, and coming after him
  almost at a run. While he was trying to decide what to do about it, she
  overtook him; rather, the wide loop of her rope overtook him. He ducked, but
  the loop settled over his head and shoulders and pulled tight about the
  chest. Jean took two turns of the rope around the saddle horn and then looked
  him over critically. In spite of herself, she smiled a little at his face,
  streaked still with grease paint, and at his eyes staring at her from between
  heavily penciled lids.</p>

  <p>"That's what you get for following," she said, after a minute of staring
  at each other. "Did you think I didn't know you were trailing along behind
  me? I saw you before I turned the cattle loose, but I just let you think you
  were being real sly and cunning about it. You did it in real moving-picture
  style; did your fat Mr. Robert Grant Burns teach you how? What is the idea,
  anyway? Were you going to abduct me and lead me to the swarthy chief of your
  gang, or band, or whatever you call it?"</p>

  <p>Having scored a point against him and so put herself into a good humor
  again, Jean laughed at him and twitched the rope, just to remind him that he
  was at her mercy. To be haughtily indignant with this honest- eyed,
  embarrassed young fellow with the streaky face and heavily-penciled eyelids
  was out of the question. The wind caught his high, peaked-crowned sombrero
  and sent it sailing like a great, flapping bird to the ground, and he could
  not catch it because Jean had his arms pinioned with the loop.</p>

  <p>She laughed again and rode over to where the hat had lodged. Gil Huntley,
  to save himself from being dragged ignominiously from the saddle, kicked his
  horse and kept pace with her. Jean leaned far over and picked up the hat, and
  examined it with amusement.</p>

  <p>"If you could just live up to your hat, my, wouldn't you be a villain,
  though!" she commented, in a soft, drawling voice. "You don't look so
  terribly blood- thirsty without it; I just guess I'd better keep it for a
  while. It would make a dandy waste-basket. Do you know, if your face were
  clean, I think you'd look almost human,&mdash;for an outlaw."</p>

  <p>She started on up the trail, nonchalantly leading her captive by the rope.
  Gil Huntley could have wriggled an arm loose and freed himself, but he did
  not. He wanted to see what she was going to do with him. He grinned when she
  had her back turned toward him, but he did not say anything for fear of
  spoiling the joke or offending her in some way. So presently Jean began to
  feel silly, and the joke lost its point and seemed inane and weak.</p>

  <p>She turned back, threw off the loop that bound his arms to his sides, and
  coiled the rope. "I wish you play-acting people would keep out of the
  country," she said impatiently. "Twice you've made me act ridiculous. I don't
  know what in the world you wanted to follow me for,&mdash;and I don't care.
  Whatever it was, it isn't going to do you one particle of good, so you
  needn't go on doing it."</p>

  <p>She looked at him full, refused to meet half-way the friendliness of his
  eyes, tossed the hat toward him, and wheeled her horse away. "Good-by," she
  said shortly, and touched Pard with the spurs. She was out of hearing before
  Gil Huntley could think of the right thing to say, and she increased the
  distance between them so rapidly that before he had quite recovered from his
  surprise at her sudden change of mood, she was so far away that he could not
  have overtaken her if he had tried.</p>

  <p>He watched her out of sight and rode back to where Burns mouthed a big,
  black cigar, and paced up and down the level space where he had set the
  interrupted scene, and waited his coming.</p>

  <p>"Rode away from you, did she? Where'd she take the cattle to? Left 'em in
  the next gulch? Well, why didn't you say so? You boys can bring 'em back, and
  we'll get to work again. Where'd you say that spring was, Gil? We'll eat
  before we do anything else. One thing about this blamed country is we don't
  have to be afraid of the light. Got to hand it to 'em for having plenty of
  good, clear sunlight, anyway?"</p>

  <p>He followed Gil to the feeble spring that seeped from under a huge
  boulder, and stooped uncomfortably to fill a tin cup. While he waited for the
  trickle to yield him a drink, he cocked his head sidewise and looked up
  quizzically at his "heavy."</p>

  <p>"You must have come within speaking distance, Gil," he guessed shrewdly.
  "Got any make-up along? You look like a mild case of the measles, right now.
  What did she have to say, anyhow?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Gil shortly. "I didn't talk to her at all. I didn't want
  to run my horse to death trying to say hello when she didn't want it that
  way."</p>

  <p>"Huh!" grunted Robert Grant Burns unbelievingly, and fished a bit of grass
  out of the cup with his little finger. He drank and said no more.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7">VII. &mdash; ROBERT GRANT BURNS GETS HELP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"YOU know the brand, don't you?" the proprietor of the hotel
  which housed the Great Western Company asked, with the tolerant air which the
  sophisticated wear when confronted by ignorance. "Easy enough to locate the
  outfit, by the cattle brand. What was it?"</p>

  <p>Whereupon Robert Grant Burns rolled his eyes helplessly toward Gil
  Huntley. "I noticed it at the time, but&mdash;what was that brand, Gil?"</p>

  <p>And Gil, if you would believe me, did not remember, either. He had driven
  the cattle half a mile or more, had helped to "steal" two calves out of the
  little herd, and yet he could not recall the mark of their owner.</p>

  <p>So the proprietor of the hotel, an old cowman who had sold out and gone
  into the hotel business when the barbed-wire came by carloads into the
  country, pulled a newspaper towards him, borrowed a pencil from Burns, and
  sketched all the cattle brands in that part of the country. While he drew one
  after the other, he did a little thinking.</p>

  <p>"Must have been the Bar Nothing, or else the Lazy A cattle you got hold
  of," he concluded, pointing to the pencil marks on the margin of the paper.
  "They range down in there, and Jean Douglas answers your description of the
  girl,&mdash;as far as looks go. She ain't all that wild and dangerous,
  though. Swing a loop with any man in the country and ride and all
  that,&mdash; been raised right out there on the Lazy A. Say! Why don't you go
  out and see Carl Douglas, and see if you can't get the use of the Lazy A for
  your pictures? Seems to me that's just the kinda place you want. Don't
  anybody live there now. It's been left alone ever since&mdash;the trouble out
  there. House and barns and corrals,&mdash;everything you want." He leaned
  closer with a confidential tone creeping into his voice, for Robert Grant
  Burns and his company were profitable guests and should be given every
  inducement to remain in the country.</p>

  <p>"It ain't but fifteen miles out there; you could go back and forth in your
  machine, easy. You go out and see Carl Douglas, anyway; won't do no harm. You
  offer him a little something for the use of the Lazy A; he'll take anything
  that looks like money. Take it from me, that's the place you want to take
  your pictures in. And, say! You want a written agreement with Carl. Have the
  use of his stock included, or he'll tax you extra. Have everything included,"
  advised the old cowman, with a sweep of his palm and his voice lowered
  discreetly. "Won't need to cost you much,&mdash; not if you don't give him
  any encouragement to expect much. Carl's that kind,&mdash;good fellow
  enough,&mdash;but he wants&mdash;the&mdash;big&mdash;end. I know him, you
  bet! And, say! Don't let on to Carl that I steered you out there. Just claim
  like you was scouting around, and seen the Lazy A ranch, and took a notion to
  it; not too much of a notion, though, or it's liable to come kinda high.</p>

  <p>"And, say!" Real enthusiasm for the idea began to lighten his eyes. "If
  you want good range dope, right out there's where you can sure find it. You
  play up to them Bar Nothing boys&mdash;Lite Avery and Joe Morris and Red. You
  ought to get some great pictures out there, man. Them boys can sure ride and
  rope and handle stock, if that's what you want; and I reckon it is, or you
  wouldn't be out here with your bunch of actors looking for the real
  stuff."</p>

  <p>They talked a long while after that. Gradually it dawned upon Burns that
  he had heard of the Lazy A ranch before, though not by that euphonious title.
  It seemed worth investigating, for he was going to need a good location for
  some exterior ranch scenes very soon, and the place he had half decided upon
  did not alto- gether please him. He inquired about roads and distances, and
  waddled off to the hotel parlor to ask Muriel Gay, his blond leading woman,
  if she would like to go out among the natives next morning. Also he wanted
  her to tell him more about that picturesque place she and Lee Milligan had
  stumbled upon the day before&mdash;the place which he suspected was none
  other than the Lazy A.</p>

  <p>That is how it came to pass that Jean, riding out with big Lite Avery the
  next morning on a little private scouting-trip of their own, to see if that
  fat moving- picture man was making free with the stock again, met the man
  unexpectedly half a mile from the Bar Nothing ranch-house.</p>

  <p>Along every trail which owns certain obstacles to swift, easy passing,
  there are places commonly spoken of as "that" place. In his journey to the
  Bar Nothing, Robert Grant Burns had come unwarned upon that sandy hollow
  which experienced drivers approached with a mental bracing for the struggle
  ahead, and with tightened lines and whip held ready. Even then they stuck
  fast, as often as not, if the load were heavy, though Bar Nothing drivers
  gaged their loads with that hollow in mind. If they could pull through there
  without mishap, they might feel sure of having no trouble elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns had come into the hollow unsuspectingly. He had been
  careening along the prairie road at a twenty-mile pace, his mind fixed upon
  hurrying through his interview with Carl Douglas, so that he would have time
  to stop at the Lazy A on the way back to town. He wanted to take a few
  exterior ranch- house scenes that day, for Robert Grant Burns was far more
  energetic than his bulk would lead one to suppose. He had Pete Lowry, his
  camera man, in the seat beside him. Back in the tonneau Muriel Gay and her
  mother, who played the character parts, clung to Lee Mulligan and a colorless
  individual who was Lowry's assistant, and gave little squeals whenever the
  machine struck a bigger bump than usual.</p>

  <p>At the top of the hill which guarded the deceptive hollow, Robert Grant
  Burns grinned over his shoulder at his character-woman. "Wait till we start
  back; I'll know the road then, and we'll do some traveling!" he promised
  darkly, and laid his toe lightly on the brake. It pleased him to be
  considered a dare-devil driver; that is why he always drove whatever machine
  carried him. They went lurching down the curving grade into the hollow, and
  struck the patch of sand that had worn out the vocabularies of more eloquent
  men than he. Robert Grant Burns fed more gas, and the engine kicked and
  groaned, and sent the wheels bur- rowing like moles to where the sand was
  deepest. Axles under, they stuck fast.</p>

  <p>When Jean and Lite came loping leisurely down the hill, the two women were
  fraying perfectly good gloves trying to pull "rabbit" brush up by the roots
  to make firmer foothold for the wheels. Robert Grant Burns was
  head-and-shoulders under the car, digging badger-like with his paws to clear
  the front axle, and coming up now and then to wipe the perspiration from his
  eyes and puff the purple out of his complexion. Pete Lowry always ducked his
  head lower over the jack when he saw the heaving of flesh which heralded
  these resting times, so that the boss could not catch him laughing. Lee
  Milligan was scooping sand upon the other side and mumbling to himself, with
  a glance now and then at the trail, in the hope of sighting a good samaritan
  with six or eight mules, perhaps. Lee thought that it would take about that
  many mules to pull them out.</p>

  <p>The two riders pulled up, smiling pityingly, just as well-mounted riders
  invariably smile upon stalled automobilists. This was not the first machine
  that had come to grief in that hollow, though they could not remember ever to
  have seen one sunk deeper in the sand.</p>

  <p>"I guess you wouldn't refuse a little help, about now," Lite observed
  casually to Lee, who was most in evidence.</p>

  <p>"We wouldn't refuse a little, but a lot is what we need," Lee amended
  glumly. "Any ranch within forty miles of here? We need about twelve good
  horses, I should say." Lee's experience with sand had been unhappy, and his
  knowledge of what one good horse could do was slight.</p>

  <p>"Shall we snake 'em out, Jean?" Lite asked her, as if he himself were
  absolutely indifferent to their plight.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I suppose we might as well. We can't leave them blocking the trail;
  somebody might want to drive past," Jean told him in much the same tone, just
  to tease Lee Milligan, who was looking them over disparagingly.</p>

  <p>"We'll be blocking the trail a good long while if we stay here till you
  move us," snapped Lee, who was rather sensitive to tones.</p>

  <p>Then Robert Grant Burns gave a heave and a wriggle, and came up for air
  and a look around. He had been composing a monologue upon the subject of
  sand, and he had not noticed that strange voices were speaking on the other
  side of the machine.</p>

  <p>"Hello, sis&mdash; How-de-do, Miss," he greeted Jean guardedly, with a
  hasty revision of the terms when he saw how her eyebrows pinched together. "I
  wonder if you could tell us where we can find teams to pull us out of this
  mess. I don't believe this old junk-wagon is ever going to do it
  herself."</p>

  <p>"How do you do, Mr. Burns? Lite and I offered to take you out on solid
  ground, but your man seemed to think we couldn't do it."</p>

  <p>"What man was that? Wasn't me, anyway. I think you can do just about
  anything you start out to do, if you ask me."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," chilled Jean, and permitted Pard to back away from his
  approach.</p>

  <p>"Say, you're some rider," he praised tactlessly, and got no reply
  whatever. Jean merely turned and rode around to where Lite eased his long
  legs in the stirrups and waited her pleasure.</p>

  <p>"Shall we help them out, Lite?" she asked distinctly. "I think perhaps we
  ought to; it's a long walk to town."</p>

  <p>"I guess we better; won't take but a minute to tie on," Lite agreed, his
  fingers dropping to his coiled rope. "Seems queer to me that folks should
  want to ride in them things when there's plenty of good horses in the
  country."</p>

  <p>"No accounting for tastes, Lite," Jean replied cheerfully. "Listen. If
  that thin man will start the engine,&mdash;he doesn't weigh more than half as
  much as you do, Mr. Burns,&mdash;we'll pull you out on solid ground. And if
  you have occasion to cross this hollow again, I advise you to keep out there
  to the right. There's a little sod to give your tires a better grip. It's
  rough, but you could make it all right if you drive carefully, and the bunch
  of you get out and walk. Don't try to keep around on the ridge; there's a
  deep washout on each side, so you couldn't possibly make it. We can't with
  the horses, even." Jean did not know that there was a note of superiority in
  her voice when she spoke the last sentence, but her listeners winced at it.
  Only Pete Lowry grinned while he climbed obediently into the machine to
  advance his spark and see that the gears were in neutral.</p>

  <p>"Don't crank up till we're ready!" Lite expostulated. "These cayuses of
  ours are pretty sensible, and they'll stand for a whole lot; but there's a
  limit. Wait till I get the ropes fixed, before you start the engine. And the
  rest of you all be ready to give the wheels a lift. You're in pretty
  deep."</p>

  <p>When Jean dismounted and hooked the stirrup over the horn so that she
  could tighten the cinch, the eyes of Robert Grant Burns glistened at the
  "picture-stuff" she made. He glanced eloquently at Pete, and Pete gave a
  twisted smile and a pantomime of turning the camera-crank; whereat Robert
  Grant Burns shook his head regretfully and groaned again.</p>

  <p>"Say, if I had a leading woman&mdash;" he began discontentedly, and
  stopped short; for Muriel Gay was standing quite close, and even through her
  grease-paint make-up she betrayed the fact that she knew exactly what her
  director was thinking, had seen and understood the gesture of the camera man,
  and was close to tears because of it all.</p>

  <p>Muriel Gay was a conscientious worker who tried hard to please her
  director. Sometimes it seemed to her that her director demanded
  impossibilities of her; that he was absolutely soulless where picture-effects
  were concerned. Her riding had all along been a subject of discord between
  them. She had learned to ride very well along the bridle-paths of Golden Gate
  Park, but Robert Grant Burns seemed to expect her to ride&mdash; well, like
  this girl, for instance, which was unjust.</p>

  <p>One could not blame her for glaring jealously while Jean tightened the
  cinch and remounted, tying her rope to the saddle horn, all ready to pull;
  with her muscles tensed for the coming struggle with the sand,&mdash;and
  perhaps with her horse as well,&mdash;and with every line of her figure
  showing how absolutely at home she was in the saddle, and how sure of
  herself.</p>

  <p>"I've tied my rope, Lite," Jean drawled, with a little laugh at what might
  happen.</p>

  <p>Lite turned his face toward her. "You better not," be warned. "Things are
  liable to start a-popping when that engine wakes up."</p>

  <p>"Well, then I'll want both hands for Pard. I've taken a couple of
  half-hitches, anyway."</p>

  <p>"You folks want to be ready at the wheels," Lite directed, waiving the
  argument. "When we start, you all want to heave-ho together. Good team-work
  will do it.</p>

  <p>"All set?" he called to Jean, when Pete Lowry bent his back to start the
  engine. "Business'll be pickin' up, directly!"</p>

  <p>"All set," replied Jean cheerfully.</p>

  <p>It seemed then that everything began to start at once, and to start in
  different directions. The engine snorted and pounded so that the whole
  machine shook with ague. When Pete jumped in and threw in the clutch, there
  was a backfire that sounded like the crack of doom. The two horses went wild,
  as their riders had half expected them to do. They lunged away from the
  horror behind them, and the slack ropes tightened with a jerk. Both were good
  rope horses, and the strain of the ropes almost recalled them to sanity and
  their training; at least they held the ropes tight for a few seconds, so that
  the machine jumped ahead and veered toward the firmer soil beside the trail,
  in response to Pete's turn of the wheel.</p>

  <p>Then Pard looked back and saw the thing coming after him, and tried to
  bolt. When he found that he could not, because of the rope, he bucked as he
  had not done since he was a half-broken broncho. That started Lite Avery's
  horse to pitching; and Pete, absorbed in watching what would have made a
  great picture, forgot to shut off the gas.</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns picked himself out of the sand where he had sprawled at
  the first wild lunge of the machine, and saw Pete Lowry, humped over the
  wheel like any speed demon, go lurching off across the hollow in the wake of
  two fear-crazed animals, that threatened at any instant to bolt off at an
  angle that would overturn the car.</p>

  <p>Then Lite let his rope slip from the saddle-horn and spurred his horse to
  one side, out of the danger zone of the other, while he felt frantically in
  his pockets for his knife.</p>

  <p>"Don't you cut my rope," Jean warned, when she saw him come plunging
  toward her, knife in hand. "This is&mdash;fine training&mdash;for Pard!"</p>

  <p>Pete came to himself, then, and killed the engine before he landed in the
  bottom of a yawning, water- washed hole, and Lite rode close and slashed
  Jean's rope, in spite of her protest; whereupon Pard went off up the, slope
  as though witches were riding him hard.</p>

  <p>At long rifle range, he circled and faced the thing that had scared him
  so, and after a little Jean persuaded him to go back as far as the trail.
  Nearer he would not stir, so she waited there for Lite.</p>

  <p>"Never even thanked us," Lite grumbled when he came up, his mouth
  stretched in a wide smile. "That girl with the kalsomine on her face made
  remarks about folks butting in. And the fat man talked into his double chin;
  dunno what all he was saying. Here's what's left of your rope. I'll get you
  another one, Jean. I was afraid that gazabo was going to run over you, is why
  I cut it."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter over there? Aren't they glad they're out of the sand?"
  Jean held her horse quiet while she studied the buzzing group.</p>

  <p>"Something busted. I guess we done some damage." Lite grinned and watched
  them over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You needn't go any further with me, Lite. That fat man's the one that had
  the cattle. I am going over to the ranch for awhile, but don't tell Aunt
  Ella." She turned to ride on up the hill toward the Lazy A, but stopped for
  another look at the perturbed motorists. "Well anyway, we snaked them out of
  the sand, didn't we, Lite?"</p>

  <p>"We sure did," Lite chuckled. "They don't seem thankful, but I guess they
  ain't any worse off than they was before. Anyway, it serves them right.
  They've no business here acting fresh."</p>

  <p>Lite said that because he was not given the power to peer into the future,
  and so could not know that Fate herself had sent Robert Grant Burns into
  their lives; and that, by a somewhat roundabout method, she was going to use
  the Great Western Film Company and Jean and himself for her servants in doing
  a work which Fate had set herself to do.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8">VIII. &mdash; JEAN SPOILS SOMETHING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JEAN found the padlock key where she had hidden it under a
  rock ten feet from the door, and let herself into her room. The peaceful
  familiarity of its four walls, and the cheerful patch of sunlight lying warm
  upon the faded rag carpet, gave her the feeling of security and of comfort
  which she seldom felt elsewhere.</p>

  <p>She wandered aimlessly around the room, brushing the dust from her books
  and straightening a tiny fold in the cradle quilt. She ran an investigative
  forefinger along the seat of her father's saddle, brought the finger away
  dusty, pulled one of the stockings from the overflowing basket and used it
  for a dust cloth. She wiped and polished the stamped leather with a
  painstaking tenderness that had in it a good deal of yearning, and finally
  left it with a gesture of hopelessness.</p>

  <p>She went next to her desk and fumbled the quirt that lay there still. Then
  she pulled out the old ledger, picked up a pencil, and began to write,
  sitting on the arm of an old, cane-seated chair while she did so. As I told
  you before, Jean never wrote anything in that book except when her moods
  demanded expression of some sort; when she did write, she said exactly what
  she thought and felt at the time. So if you are permitted to know what she
  wrote at this time, you will have had a peep into Jean's hidden, inner life
  that none of her world save Lite knew anything about. She wrote rapidly, and
  she did not always take the trouble to finish her sentences
  properly,&mdash;as if she never could quite keep pace with her thoughts. So
  this is what that page held when finally she slammed the book shut and slid
  it back into the desk:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">I don't know what's the matter with me lately. I feel as if
  I wanted to shoot somebody, or rob a bank or run away&mdash;I guess it's the
  old trouble nagging at me. I KNOW dad never did it. I don't know why, but I
  know it just the same&mdash;and I know Uncle Carl knows it too. I'd like to
  take out his brain and put it into some scientific machine that would squeeze
  out his thoughts&mdash;hope it wouldn't hurt him&mdash;I'd give him ether,
  maybe. What I want is money&mdash;enough to buy back this place and the
  stock. I don't believe Uncle Carl spent as much defending dad as he claims he
  did&mdash;not enough to take the whole ranch anyway. If I had money I'd find
  Art Osgood if I had to hunt from Alaska to Africa&mdash;don't believe he went
  to Alaska at all. Uncle Carl thinks so. . . . I'd like the price of that
  machine I helped drag out of the sand&mdash;some people can have anything
  they want but all I want is dad back, and this place the way it was before. .
  . .</p>

  <p class="letter">If I had any brains I could write something wonderful and
  be rich and famous and do the things I want to do&mdash; but there's no
  profit in just feeling wonderful things; if I could make the world see and
  feel what I see and feel&mdash; when I'm here, or riding alone. . . .</p>

  <p class="letter">If I could find Art Osgood I believe I could make him
  tell&mdash;I know he knows something, even if he didn't do it himself. I
  believe he did&mdash;But what can you do when you're a woman and haven't any
  money and must stay where you're put and can't even get out and do the little
  you might do, because somebody must have you around to lean on and tell their
  troubles to. . . . I don't blame Aunt Ella so much&mdash;but thank goodness,
  I can do without a shoulder to weep on, anyway. What's life for if you've got
  to spend your days hopping round and round in a cage. It wouldn't be a cage
  if I could have dad back&mdash;I'd be doing things for him all the time and
  that would make life worth while. Poor dad&mdash;four more years is&mdash;I
  can't think about it. I'll go crazy if I do&mdash;</p><br>

  <p>It was there that she stopped and slammed the book shut, and pushed it
  back out of sight in the desk. She picked up her hat and gloves, and went out
  with blurred eyes, and began to climb the bluff above the little spring,
  where a faint, little-used trail led to the benchland above. By following a
  rock ledge to where it was broken, and climbing through the crevice to where
  the trail marked faintly the way to the top, one could in a few minutes leave
  the Lazy A coulee out of sight below, and stand on a high level where the
  winds blew free from the mountains in the west to the mountains in the
  east.</p>

  <p>Some day, it was predicted, the benchland would be cut into squares and
  farmed,&mdash;some day when the government brought to reality a
  long-talked-of irrigation project. But in the meantime, the land lay unfenced
  and free. One could look far away to the north, and at certain times see the
  smoke of passing trains through the valley off there. One could look south to
  the distant river bluffs, and east and west to the mountains. Jean often
  climbed the bluff just for the wide outlook she gained. The cage did not seem
  so small when she could stand up there and tire her eyes with looking. Life
  did not seem quite so purposeless, and she could nearly always find little
  whispers of hope in the winds that blew there.</p>

  <p>She walked aimlessly and yet with a subconscious purpose for ten minutes
  or so, and her face was turned directly toward the eastern hills. She stopped
  on the edge of the bluff that broke abruptly there, and sat down and stared
  at the soft purple of the hills and the soft green of the nearer slopes, and
  at the peaceful blue of the sky arched over it all. Her eyes cleared of their
  troubled look and grew dreamy. Her mouth lost its tenseness and softened to a
  half smile. She was not looking now into the past that was so full of
  heartbreak, but into the future as hope pictured it for her.</p>

  <p>She was seeing the Lazy A alive again and all astir with the business of
  life; and her father saddling Sioux and riding out to look after the stock.
  She was seeing herself riding with him,&mdash;or else cooking the things he
  liked best for his dinner when he came back hungry. She sat there for a long,
  long while and never moved.</p>

  <p>A sparrow hawk swooped down quite close to Jean and then shot upward with
  a little brown bird in its claws, and startled her out of her castle
  building. She felt a hot anger against the hawk, which was like the sudden
  grasp of misfortune; and a quick sympathy with the bird, which was like
  herself and dad, caught unawares and held helpless. But she did not move, and
  the hawk circled and came back on his way to the nesting-place in the trees
  along the creek below. He came quite close, and Jean shot him as he lifted
  his wings for a higher flight. The hawk dropped head foremost to the grass
  and lay there crumpled and quiet.</p>

  <p>Jean put back her gun in its holster and went over to where the hawk lay.
  The little brown bird fluttered terrifiedly and gave a piteous, small chirp
  when her hand closed over it, and then lay quite still in her cupped palms
  and blinked up at her.</p>

  <p>Jean cuddled it up against her cheek, and talked to it and pitied it and
  promised it much in the way of fat little bugs and a warm nest and her tender
  regard. For the hawk she had no pity, nor a thought beyond the one
  investigative glance she gave its body to make sure that she had hit it where
  she meant to hit it. Lite had taught her to shoot like that,&mdash;straight
  and quick. Lite was a man who trimmed life down to the essentials, and he had
  long ago impressed it upon her that if she could not shoot quickly, and hit
  where she aimed, there was not much use in her attempting to shoot at all.
  Jean proved by her scant interest in the hawk how well she had learned the
  lesson, and how sure she was of hitting where she aimed.</p>

  <p>The little brown bird had been gashed in the breast by a sharp talon. Jean
  was much concerned over the wound, even though it did not reach any vital
  organ. She was afraid of septic poisoning, she told the bird; but added
  comfortingly: "There&mdash;you needn't worry one minute over that. I'm almost
  sure there's a bottle of peroxide down at the house, that isn't spoiled.
  We'll go and put some on it right away; and then we'll go bug-hunting. I
  believe I know where there's the fattest, juiciest bugs!" She cuddled the
  bird against her cheek, and started back across the wide point of the
  benchland to where the trail led down the bluff to the house.</p>

  <p>She was wholly absorbed in the trouble of the little brown bird; and the
  trail, following a crevice through the rocks and later winding along behind
  some scant bushes, partially concealed the buildings and the house yard from
  view until one was well down into the coulee. So it was not until she was at
  the spring, looking at the moist earth there for fat bugs for the bird, that
  she had any inkling of visitors. Then she heard voices and went quickly
  around the corner of the house toward the sound.</p>

  <p>It seemed to her that she was lately fated to come plump into the middle
  of that fat Mr. Burns' unauthorized picture-making. The first thing she saw
  when she rounded the corner was the camera perched high upon its tripod and
  staring at her with its one round eye; and the humorous-eyed Pete Lowry
  turning a crank at the side and counting in a whisper. Close beside her the
  two women were standing in animated argument which they carried on in
  undertones with many gestures to point their meaning.</p>

  <p>"Hey, you're in the scene!" called Pete Lowry, and abruptly stopped
  counting and turning the crank.</p>

  <p>"You're in the scene, sister. Step over here to one side, will you?" The
  fat director waved his pink- cameoed hand impatiently.</p>

  <p>An old bench had been placed beside the house, under a window. Jean backed
  a step and sat down upon the bench, and looked from one to the other. The two
  women glanced at her wide-eyed and moved away with mutual embracings. Jean
  lifted her hands and looked at the soft little crest and beady eyes of the
  bird, to make sure that it was not disturbed by these strangers, before she
  gave her attention to the expostulating Mr. Burns.</p>

  <p>"Did I spoil something?" she inquired casually, and watched curiously the
  pulling of many feet of narrow film from the camera.</p>

  <p>"About fifteen feet of good scene," Pete Lowry told her dryly, but with
  that queer, half smile twisting his lips.</p>

  <p>Jean looked at him and decided that, save for the company he kept, which
  made of him a latent enemy, she might like that lean man in the red sweater
  who wore a pencil over one ear and was always smiling to himself about
  something. But what she did was to cross her feet and murmur a sympathetic
  sentence to the little brown bird. Inwardly she resented deeply this bold
  trespass of Robert Grant Burns; but she meant to guard against making herself
  ridiculous again. She meant to be sure of her ground before she ordered them
  off. The memory of her humiliation before the supposed rustlers was too vivid
  to risk a repetition of the experience.</p>

  <p>"When you're thoroughly rested," said Robert Grant Burns, in the tone that
  would have shriveled the soul of one of his actors, "we'd like to make that
  scene over."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. I am pretty tired," she said in that soft, drawly voice that
  could hide so effectually her meaning. She leaned her head against the wall
  and gave a luxurious sigh, and crossed her feet the other way. She believed
  that she knew why Robert Grant Burns was growing so red in the face and
  stepping about so uneasily, and why the women were looking at her like that.
  Very likely they expected her to prove herself crude and uncivilized, but she
  meant to disappoint them even while she made them all the trouble she
  could.</p>

  <p>She pushed back her hat until its crown rested against the rough boards,
  and cuddled the little brown bird against her cheek again, and talked to it
  caressingly. Though she seemed unconscious of his presence, she heard every
  word that Robert Grant Burns was muttering to himself. Some of the words were
  plain, man-sized swearing, if she were any judge of language. It occurred to
  her that she really ought to go and find that peroxide, but she could not
  forego the pleasure of irritating this man.</p>

  <p>"I always supposed that fat men were essentially; sweet-tempered," she
  observed to the world in general, when the mutterings ceased for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"Gee! I'd like to make that," Pete Lowry said in an undertone to his
  assistant.</p>

  <p>Jean did not know that he referred to herself and the unstudied picture
  she made, sitting there with her hat pushed back, and the little bird
  blinking at her from between her cupped palms. But she looked at him
  curiously, with an impulse to ask questions about what he was doing with that
  queer-looking camera, and how he could inject motion into photography. While
  she watched, he drew out a narrow, gray strip of film and made mysterious
  markings upon it with the pencil, which he afterwards thrust absent-mindedly
  behind his ear. He closed a small door in the side of the camera, placed his
  palm over the lens and turned the little crank several times around. Then he
  looked at Jean, and from her to the director.</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns gave a sweeping, downward gesture with both
  hands,&mdash;a gesture which his company knew well,&mdash;and came toward
  Jean.</p>

  <p>"You may not know it," he began in a repressed tone, "but we're in a
  hurry. We've got work to do. We ain't here on any pleasure excursion, and
  you'll be doing me a favor by getting out of the scene so we can go on with
  our work."</p>

  <p>Jean sat still upon the bench and looked at him. "I suppose so; but why
  should I be doing you favors? You haven't seemed to appreciate them, so far.
  Of course, I dislike to seem disobliging, or anything like that, but your
  tone and manner would not make any one very enthusiastic about pleasing you,
  Mr. Burns. In fact, I don't see why you aren't apologizing for being here,
  instead of ordering me about as if I worked for you. This bench&mdash;is my
  bench. This ranch&mdash;is where I have lived nearly all my life. I hate to
  seem vain, Mr. Burns, but at the same time I think it is perfectly lovely of
  me to explain that I have a right here; and I consider myself an angel of
  patience and graciousness and many other rare virtues, because I have not
  even hinted that you are once more taking liberties with other people's
  property." She looked at him with a smile at the corners of her eyes and just
  easing the firmness of her lips, as if the humor of the situation was
  beginning to appeal to her.</p>

  <p>"If you would stop dancing about, and let your naturally sweet disposition
  have a chance, and would explain just why you are here and what you want to
  do, and would ask me nicely,&mdash;it might help you more than to get
  apoplexy over it."</p>

  <p>The two women exclaimed under their breaths to each other and moved
  farther away, as if from an impending explosion. The assistant camera man
  gurgled and turned his back abruptly. Lee Milligan, wandering up from the
  stables, stopped and stared. No one, within the knowledge of those present,
  had ever spoken so to Robert Grant Burns; no one had ever dreamed of speaking
  thus to him. They had seen him when rage had mastered him and for slighter
  cause; it was not an experience that one would care to repeat.</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns walked up to Jean as if he meant to lift her from the
  bench and hurl her by sheer brute force out of his way. He stopped so close
  to her that his shadow covered her.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to get out of the way so we can go on?" he asked, in the
  tone of one who gives a last merciful chance of escape from impending
  doom.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to explain why you're here, and apologize for your tone and
  manner, which are extremely rude?" Jean did not pay his rage the compliment
  of a glance at him. She was looking at the dainty beak of the little brown
  bird, and was telling herself that she could not be bullied into losing
  control of herself. These two women should not have the satisfaction of
  calling her a crude, ignorant, country girl; and Robert Grant Burns should
  not have the triumph of browbeating her into yielding one inch of ground. She
  forced herself to observe the wonderfully delicate feathers on the bird's
  head. It seemed more content now in the little nest her two palms had made
  for it. Its heart did not flutter so much, and she fancied that the tiny,
  bead-like eyes were softer in their bright regard of her.</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns came to a pause. Jean sensed that he was waiting for
  some reply, and she looked up at him. His hand was just reaching out to her
  shoulder, but it dropped instead to his coat pocket and fumbled for his
  handkerchief. Her eyes strayed to Pete Lowry. He was looking upward with that
  measuring glance which belongs to his profession, estimating the length of
  time the light would be suitable for the scene he had focussed. She followed
  his glance to where the shadow of the kitchen had crept closer to the bench.
  Jean was not stupid, and she had passed through the various stages of the
  kodak fever; she guessed what was in the mind of the operator, and when she
  met his eyes full, she smiled at him sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"I should dearly love to watch you work," she said to him frankly. "But
  you see how it is; Mr. Burns hasn't got hold of himself yet. If he comes to
  his senses before he has a stroke of apoplexy, will you show me how you run
  that thing?"</p>

  <p>"You bet I will," the red-sweatered one promised her cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"How much longer will it be before this bench is in the shade?" she asked
  him next.</p>

  <p>"Half an hour,&mdash;maybe a little longer." Pete glanced again anxiously
  upward.</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;how long do these spasms usually last?" Jean's head tilted
  toward Robert Grant Burns as impersonally as if she were indicating a horse
  with colic.</p>

  <p>But the camera man had gone as far as was wise, if he cared to continue
  working for Burns, and he made no reply whatever. So Jean turned her
  attention to the man whose bulk shaded her from the sun, and whose remarks
  would have been wholly unforgivable had she not chosen to ignore them.</p>

  <p>"If you really are anxious to go on making pictures, why don't you stop
  all that ranting and be sensible about it?" she asked him. "You can't bully
  me into being afraid of you, you know. And really, you are making an awful
  spectacle of yourself, going on like that."</p>

  <p>"Listen here! Are you going to get off that bench and out of the scene?"
  By a tremendous effort Robert Grant Burns spoke that sentence with a husky
  kind of calm.</p>

  <p>"That all depends upon yourself, Mr. Burns. First, I want to know by what
  right you come here with your picture-making. You haven't explained that yet,
  you know."</p>

  <p>The highest paid director of the Great Western Film Company looked at her
  long. With her head tilted back, Jean returned the look.</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right&mdash;all right," he surrendered finally. "Read that paper.
  That ought to satisfy you that we ain't trespassing here or anywhere else.
  And if you'd kindly,"&mdash;and Mr. Burns emphasized the word
  "kindly,"&mdash;"remove yourself to some other spot that is just as
  comfortable&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jean did not even hear him, once she had the paper in her hands and had
  begun to read it. So Robert Grant Burns folded his arms across his heaving
  chest and watched her and studied her and measured her with his mind while
  she read. He saw the pulling together of her eyebrows, and the pinching of
  her under- lip between her teeth. He saw how she unconsciously sheltered the
  little brown bird under her left hand in her lap because she must hold the
  paper with the other, and he quite forgot his anger against her.</p>

  <p>Sitting so, she made a picture that appealed to him. Had you asked him
  why, he would have said that she was the type that would photograph well, and
  that she had a screen personality; which would have been high praise indeed,
  coming from him.</p>

  <p>Jean read the brief statement that in consideration of a certain sum paid
  to him that day by Robert G. Burns, her uncle, Carl Douglas, thereby gave the
  said Robert G. Burns permission to use the Lazy A ranch and anything upon it
  or in any manner pertaining to it, for the purpose of making motion pictures.
  It was plainly set forth that Robert G. Burns should be held responsible for
  any destruction of or damage to the property, and that he might, for the sum
  named, use any cattle bearing the Lazy A or Bar O brands for the making of
  pictures, so long as he did them no injury and returned them in good
  condition to the range from which he had gathered them.</p>

  <p>Jean recognized her uncle's ostentatious attempt at legal phraseology and
  knew, even without the evidence of his angular writing, that the document was
  genuine. She knew also that Robert Grant Burns was justified in ordering her
  off that bench; she had no right there, where he was making his pictures. She
  forced back the bitterness that filled her because of her own helplessness,
  and folded the paper carefully. The little brown bird chirped shrilly and
  fluttered a feeble protest when she took away her sheltering hand. Jean
  returned the paper hastily to its owner and took up the bird.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon for delaying your work," she said coldly, and rose from
  the bench. "But you might have explained your presence in the first place."
  She wrapped the bird carefully in her handkerchief so that only its beak and
  its bright eyes were uncovered, pulled her hat forward upon her head, and
  walked away from them down the path to the stables.</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns turned slowly on his heels and watched her go, and
  until she had led out her horse, mounted and ridden away, he said never a
  word. Pete Lowry leaned an elbow upon the camera and watched her also, until
  she passed out of sight around the corner of the dilapidated calf shed, and
  he was as silent as the director.</p>

  <p>"Some rider," Lee Milligan commented to the assistant camera man, and
  without any tangible reason regretted that he had spoken.</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns turned harshly to the two women. "Now then, you two go
  through that scene again. And when you put out your hand to stop Muriel,
  don't grab at her, Mrs. Gay. Hesitate! You want your son to get the warning,
  but you've got your doubts about letting her take the risk of going. And,
  Gay, when you read the letter, try and show a little emotion in your face.
  You saw how that girl looked&mdash;see if you can't get that hurt, bitter
  look GRADUALLY, as you read. The way she got it. Put in more feeling and not
  so much motion. You know what I mean; you saw the girl. That's the stuff that
  gets over. Ready? Camera!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9">IX. &mdash; A MAN-SIZED JOB FOR JEAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JEAN was just returning wet-lashed from burying the little
  brown bird under a wild-rose bush near the creek. She had known all along
  that it would die; everything that she took any interest in turned out badly,
  it seemed to her. The wonder was that the bird had lived so long after she
  had taken it under her protection.</p>

  <p>All that day her Aunt Ella had worn a wet towel turban-wise upon her head,
  and the look of a martyr about to enter a den of lions. Add that to the
  habitual atmosphere of injury which she wore, and Aunt Ella was not what one
  might call a cheerful companion. Besides, the appearance of the wet towel was
  a danger signal to Jean's conscience, and forbade any thought of saddling
  Pard and riding away from the Bar Nothing into her own dream world and the
  great outdoors. Jean's conscience commanded her instead to hang her
  riding-clothes in the closet and wear striped percale and a gingham apron,
  which she hated; and to sweep and dust and remember not to whistle, and to
  look sympathetic,&mdash;which she was not, particularly; and to ask her Aunt
  Ella frequently if she felt any better, and if there was anything Jean could
  do for her. There never was anything she could do, but conscience and custom
  required her to observe the ceremony of asking. Aunt Ella found some languid
  satisfaction in replying dolorously that there was nothing that anybody could
  do, and that her part in life seemed to be to suffer.</p>

  <p>You may judge what Jean's mood was that day, when you are told that she
  came to the point, not an hour before the bird died, of looking at her aunt
  with that little smile at the corners of her eyes and just easing her lips.
  "Well, you certainly play your part in life with a heap of enthusiasm," she
  had replied, and had gone out into the kitchen and whistled when she did not
  feel in the least like whistling. Her conscience knew Jean pretty well, and
  did not attempt to reprove her for what she had done.</p>

  <p>Then she found the bird dead in the little nest she had made for it, and
  things went all wrong.</p>

  <p>She was returning from the burial of the bird, and was trying to force
  herself back to her normal attitude of philosophic calm, when she saw her
  Uncle Carl sitting on the edge of the front porch, with his elbows resting
  loosely upon his knees, his head bowed, and his boot-heel digging a rude
  trench in the hard-packed earth.</p>

  <p>The sight of him incensed her suddenly. Once more she wished that she
  might get at his brain and squeeze out his thoughts; and it never occurred to
  her that she would probably have found them extremely commonplace thoughts
  that strayed no farther than his own little personal business of life, and
  that they would easily be translated to the dollar sign. His attitude was one
  of gloomy meditation, and her own mood supplied the subject. She watched him
  for a minute or two, and his abstraction was so deep that he did not feel her
  presence.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Carl, just how much did the Lazy A cost you?" she asked so abruptly
  that she herself was surprised at the question. "Or putting it another way,
  just how many dollars and cents did you spend in defending dad?"</p>

  <p>Carl started, which was perfectly natural, and glared at her, which was
  natural also, when one considers that Jean had without warning opened a
  subject tacitly forbidden upon that ranch. His eyes hardened a little while
  he looked at her, for between these two there was scant affection.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to know for?" he countered, when she persisted in
  looking at him as though she was waiting for an answer.</p>

  <p>"Because I've a right to know. Some time,&mdash; within four
  years,&mdash;I mean to buy back the Lazy A. I want to know how much it will
  take." Until that moment Jean had merely dreamed of some day buying it back.
  Until she spoke she would have named the idea a beautiful, impossible
  desire.</p>

  <p>"Where you going to get the money?" Carl looked at her curiously, as if he
  almost doubted her sanity.</p>

  <p>"Rob a bank, perhaps. How much will it take to square things with you? Of
  course, being a relative, I expect to be cheated a little. So I am going to
  adopt sly, sleuth-like methods and find out just how much dad owed you
  before&mdash;it happened, and just how much the lawyers charged, and what was
  the real market value of the outfit, and all that. Dad told me&mdash; dad
  told me that there was something left over for me. He didn't
  explain&mdash;there wasn't time, and I&mdash; couldn't listen to dollar-talk
  then. I've gone along all this time, just drifting and getting used to facts,
  and taking it for granted that everything is all right&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, what's wrong? Everything is all right, far as I know. I can see
  what you're driving at&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And I'm a pretty fair driver, too," Jean cut in calmly. "I'll reach my
  destination, I think,&mdash;give me time enough."</p>

  <p>"Whatever fool notion you've got in your head, you'd better drop it," Carl
  told her harshly. "There ain't anything you can do to better matters. I came
  out with the worst of it, when you come right down to facts, and all the
  nagging-"</p>

  <p>Jean went toward him as if she would strike him with her uplifted hand.
  "Don't dare say that! How can you say that,&mdash;and think of dad? He got
  the worst of it. He's the one that suffers most&mdash;and&mdash; he's as
  innocent as you or I. You know it."</p>

  <p>Carl rose from the porch and faced her like an enemy. "What do you mean by
  that? I know it? If I knew anything like that, do you think I'd leave a stone
  unturned to prove it? Do you think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think we both know dad. And some things were not proved,&mdash;to my
  satisfaction, at least. And you know how long the jury was out, and what a
  time they had agreeing. Some points were weak. It was simply that they
  couldn't point to any one else. You know that was it. If I could find Art
  Osgood&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What's he got to do with it?" Her uncle leaned a little and peered into
  her face, which the dusk was veiling.</p>

  <p>"That is what I want to find out." Jean's voice was quiet, but it had a
  quality which he had never before noticed.</p>

  <p>"You'd better," he advised her tritely, "let sleeping dogs lie."</p>

  <p>"That's the trouble with sleeping dogs; they do lie, more often than not.
  These particular dogs have lied for nearly three years. I'm going to stir
  them up and see if I can't get a yelp of the truth out of them."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are!" Carl laughed ironically. "You'll stir up a lot of
  unpleasantness for yourself and the rest of us, is what you'll do. The
  thing's over and done with. Folks are beginning to forget it. You've got a
  home&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jean laughed, and her laugh was extremely unpleasant.</p>

  <p>"You get as good as the rest of us get," her uncle reminded her sharply.
  "I came near going broke myself over the affair, if you want to know; and you
  stand there and accuse me of cheating you out of something! I don't know what
  in heaven's name you expect. The Lazy A didn't make me rich, I can tell you
  that. It just barely helped to tide things over. You've got a home here, and
  you can come and go as you please. What you ain't got," he added bitterly,
  "is common gratitude."</p>

  <p>He turned away from her and went into the house, and Jean sat down upon
  the edge of the porch and stared away at the dimming outline of the hills,
  and wondered what had come over her.</p>

  <p>Three years on this ranch, seeing her uncle every day almost, living under
  the same roof with him, talking with him upon the everyday business of
  life,&mdash;and to- night, for the first time, the forbidden subject had been
  opened. She had said things that until lately she had not realized were in
  her mind. She had never liked her uncle, who was so different from her
  father, but she had never accused him in her mind of unfairness until she had
  written something of the sort in her ledger. She had never thought of
  quarrelling,&mdash;and yet one could scarcely call this encounter less than a
  quarrel. And the strange part of it was that she still believed what she had
  said; she still intended to do the things she declared she would do. Just how
  she would do them she did not know, but her purpose was hardening and coming
  clean-cut out of the vague background of her mind.</p>

  <p>After awhile the dim outline of the high-shouldered hills glowed under a
  yellowing patch of light. Jean sat with her chin in her palms and watched the
  glow brighten swiftly. Then some unseen force seemed to be pushing a bright
  yellow disk up through a gap in the hills, and the gap was almost too narrow,
  so that the disk touched either side as it slid slowly upward. At last it was
  up, launched fairly upon its leisurely, drifting journey across to the
  farther hills behind her. It was not quite round. That was because one edge
  had scraped too hard against the side of the hill, perhaps. But warped though
  it was, its light fell softly upon Jean's face, and showed it set and still
  and stern-eyed and somber.</p>

  <p>She sat there awhile longer, until the slopes lay softly revealed to her,
  their hollows filled with inky shadows. She drew a long breath then, and
  looked around her at the familiar details of the Bar Nothing dwelling-place,
  softened a little by the moonlight, but harsh with her memories of unhappy
  days spent there. She rose and went into the house and to her room, and
  changed the hated striped percale for her riding-clothes.</p>

  <p>A tall, lank form detached itself from the black shade of the bunk-house
  as she went by, hesitated perceptibly, and then followed her down to the
  corral. When she had gone in with a rope and later led out Pard, the form
  stood forth in the white light of the moon.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going, Jean?" Lite asked her in a tone that was soothing in
  its friendliness.</p>

  <p>"That you, Lite? I'm going&mdash;well, just going. I've got to ride." She
  pulled Pard's bridle off the peg where she always hung it, and laid an arm
  over his neck while she held the bit against his clinched teeth. Pard never
  did take kindly to the feel of the cold steel in his mouth, and she spoke to
  him sharply before his jaws slackened.</p>

  <p>"Want me to go along with you?" Lite asked, and reached for his saddle and
  blanket.</p>

  <p>"No, I want you to go to bed." Jean's tone was softer than it had been for
  that whole day. "You've had all the riding you need. I've been shut up with
  Aunt Ella and her favorite form of torture."</p>

  <p>"Got your gun?" Lite gave the latigo a final pull which made Pard
  grunt.</p>

  <p>"Of course. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing,&mdash;only it's a good night for coyotes, and you might get a
  shot at one. Another thing, a gun's no good on earth when you haven't got it
  with you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and you've told me so about once a week ever since I was big enough
  to pull a trigger," Jean retorted, with something approaching her natural
  tone. "Maybe I won't come back, Lite. Maybe I'll camp over home till
  morning."</p>

  <p>Lite did not say anything in reply to that. He leaned his long person
  against a corral post and watched her out of sight on the trail up the hill.
  Then he caught his own horse, saddled it leisurely, and rode away.</p>

  <p>Jean rode slowly, leaving the trail and striking out across the open
  country straight for the Lazy A. She had no direct purpose in riding this
  way; she had not intended to ride to the Lazy A until she named the place to
  Lite as her destination, but since she had told him so, she knew that was
  where she was going. The picture-people would not be there at night, and she
  felt the need of coming as close as possible to her father; at the Lazy A,
  where his thoughts would cling, she felt near to him,&mdash;much nearer than
  when she was at the Bar Nothing. And that the gruesome memory of what had
  happened there did not make the place seem utterly horrible merely proves how
  unshakable was her faith in him.</p>

  <p>A coyote trotted up out of a hollow facing her, stiffened with
  astonishment, dropped nose and tail, and slid away in the shadow of the hill.
  A couple of minutes later Jean saw him sitting alert upon his haunches on a
  moon-bathed slope, watching to see what she would do. She did nothing; and
  the coyote pointed his nose to the moon, yap-yap-yapped a quavering defiance,
  and slunk out of sight over the hill crest.</p>

  <p>Her mind now was more at ease than it had been since the day of horror
  when she had first stared black tragedy in the face. She was passing through
  that phase of calm elation which follows close upon the heels of a great
  resolve. She had not yet come to the actual surmounting of the obstacles that
  would squeeze hope from the heart of her; she had not yet looked upon the
  possibility of absolute failure.</p>

  <p>She was going to buy back the Lazy A from her Uncle Carl, and she was
  going to tear away that atmosphere of emptiness and desolation which it had
  worn so long. She was going to prove to all men that her father never had
  killed Johnny Croft. She was going to do it! Then life would begin where it
  had left off three years ago. And when this deadening load of trouble was
  lifted, then perhaps she could do some of the glorious, great things she had
  all of her life dreamed of doing. Or, if she never did the glorious, great
  things, she would at least have done something to justify her existence. She
  would be content in her cage if she could go round and round doing things for
  dad.</p>

  <p>A level stretch of country lay at the foot of the long bluff, which
  farther along held the Lazy A coulee close against its rocky side. The high
  ridges stood out boldly in the moonlight, so that she could see every rock
  and the shadow that it cast upon the ground. Little, soothing night noises
  fitted themselves into her thoughts and changed them to waking dreams.
  Crickets that hushed while she passed them by; the faint hissing of a half-
  wakened breeze that straightway slept upon the grasses it had stirred; the
  sleepy protest of some bird which Pard's footsteps had startled.</p>

  <p>She came into Lazy A coulee, half fancying that it was a real home-coming.
  But when she reached the gate and found it lying flat upon the ground away
  from the broad tread of the picture-people's machine, her mind jarred from
  dreams back to reality. From sheer habit she dismounted, picked up the
  spineless thing of stakes and barbed wire, dragged it into place across the
  trail, and fastened it securely to the post. She remounted and went on, and a
  little of the hopefulness was gone from her face.</p>

  <p>"I'll just about have to rob a bank, I guess," she told herself with a
  grim humor at the tremendous undertaking to which she had so calmly committed
  herself. "This is what dad would call a man-sized job, I reckon." She pulled
  up in the white-lighted trail and stared along the empty, sagging-roofed
  sheds and stables, and at the corral with its open gate and warped rails and
  leaning posts. "I'll just about have to rob a bank,&mdash;or write a book
  that will make me famous."</p>

  <p>She touched Pard with a rein end and went on slowly. "Robbing a bank would
  be the quickest and easiest," she decided whimsically, as she neared the
  place where she always sheltered Pard. "But not so ladylike. I guess I'll
  write a book. It should be something real thrilly, so the people will rush
  madly to all the bookstores to buy it. It should have a beautiful girl, and
  at least two handsome men,&mdash;one with all the human virtues, and the
  other with all the arts of the devil and the cruel strength of the savage.
  And&mdash;I think some Indians and outlaws would add several dollars' worth
  of thrills; or else a ghost and a haunted house. I wonder which would sell
  the best? Indians could steal the girl and give her two handsome men a chance
  to do chapters of stunts, and the wicked one could find her first and carry
  her away in front of him on a horse (they do those things in books!) and the
  hero could follow in a mad chase for miles and miles&mdash;</p>

  <p>"But then, ghosts can be made very creepy, with tantalizing glimpses of
  them now and then in about every other chapter, and mysterious hints here and
  there, and characters coming down to breakfast with white, drawn faces and
  haggard eyes. And the wicked one would look over his shoulder and then utter
  a sardonic laugh. Sardonic is such an effective word; I don't believe Indians
  would give him any excuse for sardonic laughter."</p>

  <p>She swung down from the saddle and led Pard into his stall, that was very
  black next the manger and very light where the moon shone in at the door. "I
  must have lots of moonlight and several stormy sunsets, and the wind soughing
  in the branches. I shall have to buy a new dictionary,&mdash;a big, fat,
  heavy one with the flags of all nations and how to measure the contents of an
  empty hogshead, and the deaf and dumb alphabet, and everything but the word
  you want to know the meaning of and whether it begins with ph or an f."</p>

  <p>She took the saddle off Pard and hung it up by a stirrup on the rusty
  spike where she kept it, with the bridle hung over the stirrup, and the
  saddle blanket folded over the horn. She groped in the manger and decided
  that there was hay enough to last him till morning, and went out and closed
  the door. Her shadow fell clean cut upon the rough planks, and she stood for
  a minute looking at it as if it were a person. Her Stetson hat tilted a
  little to one side, her hair fluffed loosely at the sides, leaving her neck
  daintily slender where it showed above the turned-back collar of her gray
  sweater; her shoulders square and capable and yet not too heavy, and the slim
  contour of her figure reaching down to the ground. She studied it
  abstractedly, as she would study herself in her mirror, conscious of the
  individuality, its likeness to herself.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what kind of a mess you'll make of it," she said to her
  shadow, "but you're going to tackle it, just the same. You can't do a thing
  till you get some money."</p>

  <p>She turned then and went thoughtfully up to the house and into her room,
  which had as yet been left undisturbed behind the bars she had placed against
  idle invasion.</p>

  <p>The moon shone full into the window that faced the coulee, and she sat
  down in the old, black wooden rocker and gazed out upon the familiar, open
  stretch of sand and scant grass-growth that lay between the house and the
  corrals. She turned her eyes to the familiar bold outline of the bluff that
  swung round in a crude oval to the point where the trail turned into the
  coulee from the southwest. Half-way between the base and the ragged skyline,
  the boulder that looked like an elephant's head stood out, white of profile,
  hooded with black shade. Beyond was the fat shelf of ledge that had a small
  cave beneath, where she had once found a nest full of little, hungry birds
  and upon the slope beneath the telltale, scattered wing-feathers, to show
  what fate had fallen upon the mother. Those birds had died also, and she had
  wept and given them Christian burial, and had afterwards spent hours every
  day with her little rifle hunting the destroyer of that small home. She
  remembered the incident now as a small thread in the memory-pattern she was
  weaving.</p>

  <p>While the shadows shortened as the moon swung high, she sat and looked out
  upon the coulee and the bluff that sheltered it, and she saw the things that
  were blended cunningly with the things that were not. After a long while her
  hands unclasped themselves from behind her head and dropped numbly to her
  lap. She sighed and moved stiffly, and knew that she was tired and that she
  must get some sleep, because she could not sit down in one spot and think her
  way through the problems she had taken it upon herself to solve. So she got
  up and crept under the Navajo blanket upon the couch, tucked it close about
  her shoulders, and shut her eyes deliberately. Presently she fell asleep.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">X. &mdash; JEAN LEARNS WHAT FEAR IS LIKE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SOMETIME in the still part of the night which comes after
  midnight, Jean woke slowly from dreaming of the old days that had been so
  vivid in her mind when she went to sleep. Just at first she did not know what
  it was that awakened her, though her eyes were open and fixed upon the
  lighted square of the window. She knew that she was in her room at the Lazy
  A, but just at first it seemed to her that she was there because she had
  always been sleeping in that room. She sighed and turned her face away from
  the moonlight, and closed her eyes again contentedly.</p>

  <p>Half dreaming she opened them again and stared up at the low ceiling.
  Somewhere in the house she heard footsteps. Very slowly she wakened enough to
  listen. They were footsteps,&mdash;the heavy, measured tread of some man.
  They were in the room that had been her father's bedroom, and at first they
  seemed perfectly natural and right; they seemed to be her dad's footsteps,
  and she wondered mildly what he was doing, up at that time of night.</p>

  <p>The footsteps passed from there into the kitchen and stopped in the corner
  where stood the old-fashioned cupboard with perforated tin panels in the
  doors and at the sides, and the little drawers at the top,&mdash;the kind
  that old people call a "safe." She heard a drawer pulled out. Without giving
  any conscious thought to it, she knew which drawer it was; it was the one
  next the wall&mdash;the one that did not pull out straight, and so had to be
  jerked out. What was her dad . . . ?</p>

  <p>Jean thrilled then with a tremor of fear. She had wakened fully enough to
  remember. That was not her dad, out there in the kitchen. She did not know
  who it was; it was some strange man prowling through the house, hunting for
  something. She felt again the tremor of fear that is the heritage of
  womanhood alone in the dark. She pulled the Navajo blanket up to her ears
  with the instinct of the woman to hide, because she is not strong enough to
  face and fight the danger that comes in the dark. She listened to the sound
  of that drawer being pushed back, and the other drawer being pulled out, and
  she shivered under the blanket.</p>

  <p>Then she reached out her hand and got hold of her six-shooter which she
  had laid down unthinkingly upon a chair near the couch. She wondered if she
  had locked the outside door when she came in. She could not remember having
  done so; probably she had not, since it is not the habit of honest
  ranch-dwellers to lock their doors at night. She wanted to get up and see,
  and fasten it somehow; but she was afraid the man out there might hear her.
  As it was, she reasoned nervously with herself, he probably did not suspect
  that there was any one in the house. It was an empty house. And unless he had
  seen Pard in the closed stall. . . . She wondered if he had heard Pard there,
  and had investigated and found him. She wondered if he would come into this
  room. She remembered how securely she had nailed up the door from the
  kitchen, and she breathed freer. She remembered also that she had her gun,
  there under her hand. She closed her trembling fingers on the familiar grip
  of it, and the feel of it comforted her and steadied her.</p>

  <p>Yet she had no desire, no slightest impulse to get up and see who was
  there. She was careful not to move, except to cover the doorway to the
  kitchen with her gun.</p>

  <p>After a few minutes the man came and tried the door, and Jean lifted
  herself cautiously upon her elbow and waited in grim desperation. If he
  forced that door open, if he came in, she certainly would shoot; and if she
  shot,&mdash;well, you remember the fate of that hawk on the wing.</p>

  <p>The man did not force the door open, which was perhaps the luckiest thing
  that ever happened to him. He fussed there until he must have made sure that
  it was fastened firmly upon the inside, and then he left it and went into
  what had been the living-room. Jean did not move from her half-sitting
  position, nor did she change the aim of her gun. He might come back and try
  again.</p>

  <p>She heard him moving about in the living-room. Surely he did not expect to
  find money in an empty house, or anything else of any commercial value. What
  was he after? Finally he came back to the kitchen, crossed it, and stood
  before the barred door. He pushed against it tentatively, then stood still
  for a minute and finally went out. Jean heard him step upon the porch and
  pull the kitchen door shut behind him. She knew that squeal of the bottom
  hinge, and she knew the final gasp and click that proved the latch was
  fastened. She heard him step off the porch to the path, she heard the soft
  crunch of his feet in the sandy gravel as he went away toward the stable.
  Very cautiously she got off the couch and crept to the window; and with her
  gun gripped tight in her hand, she looked out. But he had moved into a deep
  shadow of the bluff, and she could see nothing of him save the deeper shadow
  of his swift-moving body as he went down to the corral. Jean gave a long sigh
  of nervous relaxation, and crept shivering under the Navajo blanket. The gun
  she slid under the pillow, and her fingers rested still upon the cool comfort
  of the butt.</p>

  <p>Soon she heard a horse galloping, and she went to the window again and
  looked out. The moon hung low over the bluff, so that the trail lay mostly in
  the shadow. But down by the gate it swung out in a wide curve to the rocky
  knoll, and there it lay moon-lighted and empty. She fixed her eyes upon that
  curve and waited. In a moment the horseman galloped out upon the curve,
  rounded it, and disappeared in the shadows beyond. At that distance and in
  that deceptive light, she could not tell who it was; but it was a horseman, a
  man riding at night in haste, and with some purpose in mind.</p>

  <p>Jean had thought that the prowler might be some tramp who had wandered far
  off the beaten path of migratory humans, and who, stumbling upon the coulee
  and its empty dwellings, was searching at random for whatever might be worth
  carrying off. A horseman did not fit that theory anywhere. That particular
  horseman had come there deliberately, had given the house a deliberate
  search, and had left in haste when he had finished. Whether he had failed or
  succeeded in finding what he wanted, he had left. He had not searched the
  stables, unless he had done that before coming into the house. He had not
  forced his way into her room, probably because he did not want to leave
  behind him the evidence of his visit which the door would have given, or
  because he feared to disturb the contents of Jean's room.</p>

  <p>Jean stared up in the dark and puzzled long over the identity of that man,
  and his errand. And the longer she thought about it, the more completely she
  was at sea. All the men that she knew were aware that she kept this room
  habitable, and visited the ranch often. That was no secret; it never had been
  a secret. No one save Lite Avery had ever been in it, so far as she
  knew,&mdash;unless she counted those chance trespassers who had prowled
  boldly through her most sacred belongings. So that almost any one in the
  country, had he any object in searching the house, would know that this room
  was hers, and would act in that knowledge.</p>

  <p>As to his errand. There could be no errand, so far as she knew. There were
  no missing papers such as plays and novels are accustomed to have cunningly
  hidden in empty houses. There was no stolen will, no hidden treasure, no
  money, no Rajah's ruby, no ransom of a king; these things Jean named over
  mentally, and chuckled at the idea of treasure-hunting at the Lazy A. It vas
  very romantic, very mysterious, she told herself. And she analyzed the
  sensation of little wet alligators creeping up her spine (that was her own
  simile), and decided that her book should certainly have a ghost in it; she
  was sure that she could describe with extreme vividness the effect of a ghost
  upon her various characters.</p>

  <p>In this wise she recovered her composure and laughed at her fear, and
  planned new and thrilly incidents for her novel.</p>

  <p>She would not tell Lite anything about it, she decided. He would try to
  keep her from coming over here by herself, and that would precipitate one of
  those arguments between them that never seemed to get them anywhere, because
  Lite never would yield gracefully, and Jean never would yield at
  all,&mdash;which does not make for peace.</p>

  <p>She wished, just the same, that Lite was there. It would be much more
  comfortable if he were near instead of away over to the Bar Nothing, sound
  asleep in the bunk-house. As a self-appointed guardian, Jean considered Lite
  something of a nuisance, when he wasn't funny. But as a big, steady-nerved
  friend and comrade, he certainly was a comfort.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">XI. &mdash; LITE'S PUPIL DEMONSTRATES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JEAN awoke to hear the businesslike buzzing of an automobile
  coming up from the gate. Evidently they were going to make pictures there at
  the house, which did not suit her plans at all. She intended to spend the
  early morning writing the first few chapters of that book which to her
  inexperience seemed a simple task, and to leave before these people arrived.
  As it was, she was fairly caught. There was no chance of escaping unnoticed,
  unless she slipped out and up the bluff afoot, and that would not have helped
  her in the least, since Pard was in the stable.</p>

  <p>From behind the curtains she watched them for a few minutes. Robert Grant
  Burns wore a light overcoat, which made him look pudgier than ever, and he
  scowled a good deal over some untidy-looking papers in his hands, and
  conferred with Pete Lowry in a dissatisfied tone, though his words were
  indistinguishable. Muriel Gay watched the two covertly, it seemed to Jean,
  and she also looked dissatisfied over something.</p>

  <p>Burns and the camera man walked down toward the stables, studying the
  bluff and the immediate surroundings, and still talking together. Lee
  Milligan, with his paint-shaded eyes and his rouged lips and heavily
  pencilled eyebrows, came up and stood close to Muriel, who was sitting now
  upon the bench near Jean's window.</p>

  <p>"Burns ought to cut out those scenes, Gay," he began sympathetically. "You
  can't do any more than you did yesterday. And believe me, you put it over in
  good style. I don't see what he wants more than you did."</p>

  <p>"What he wants," said Muriel Gay dispiritedly, "is for me to pull off
  stunts like that girl. I never saddled a horse in my life till he ordered me
  to do it in the scene yesterday. Why didn't he tell me far enough ahead so I
  could rehearse the business? Latigo! It sounds like some Spanish dish with
  grated cheese on top. I don't believe he knows himself what he meant."</p>

  <p>"He's getting nutty on Western dope," sympathized Lee Milligan. "I don't
  see where this country's got anything on Griffith Park for atmosphere,
  anyway. What did he want to come away up here in this God- forsaken country
  for? What is there TO it, more than he could get within an hour's ride of Los
  Angeles?"</p>

  <p>"I should worry about the country," said Muriel despondently, "if somebody
  would kindly tell me what looping up your latigo means. Burns says that he's
  got to retake that saddling scene just as soon as the horses get here. It
  looks just as simple," she added spitefully, "as climbing to the top of the
  Berry Building tower and doing a leap to a passing airship. In fact, I'd
  choose the leap."</p>

  <p>A warm impulse of helpfulness stirred Jean. She caught up her hat, buckled
  her gun belt around her from pure habit, tucked a few loose strands of hair
  into place, and went out where they were.</p>

  <p>"If you'll come down to the stable with me," she drawled, while they were
  staring their astonishment at her unexpected appearance before them, "I'll
  show you how to saddle up. Pard's awfully patient about being fussed with;
  you can practice on him. He's mean about taking the bit, though, unless you
  know just how to take hold of him. Come on."</p>

  <p>The three of them,&mdash;Muriel Gay and her mother and Lee
  Milligan,&mdash;stared at Jean without speaking. To her it seemed perfectly
  natural that she should walk up and offer to help the girl; to them it seemed
  not so natural. For a minute the product of the cities and the product of the
  open country studied each other curiously.</p>

  <p>"Come on," urged Jean in her lazily friendly drawl. "It's simple enough,
  once you get the hang of it." And she smiled before she added, "A latigo is
  just the strap that fastens the cinch. I'll show you."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet Bobby Burns doesn't know that," said Muriel Gay, and got up from
  the bench. "It's awfully good of you; Mr. Burns is so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I noticed that," said Jean, while Muriel was waiting for a word that
  would relieve her feelings without being too blunt.</p>

  <p>Burns and Pete Lowry and the assistant had gone down the coulee, still
  studying the bluff closely. "I've got to ride down that bluff," Muriel
  informed Jean, her eyes following her director gloomily. "He asked me last
  night if I could throw a rope. I don't know what for; it's an extra punch he
  wants to put in this picture somewhere. I wish to goodness they wouldn't let
  him write his own scenarios; he just lies awake nights, lately, thinking up
  impossible scenes so he can bully us afterwards. He's simply gone nutty on
  the subject of punches."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's easy enough to learn how to saddle a horse," Jean told Muriel
  cheerfully. "First you want to put on the bridle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Burns told me to put on the saddle first; and then he cuts the scene just
  as I pick up the bridle. The trouble is to get the saddle on right, and
  then&mdash;that latigo dope!"</p>

  <p>"But you ought to bridle him first," Jean insisted. "Supposing you just
  got the saddle on, and your horse got startled and ran off? If you have the
  bridle on, even if you haven't the reins, you can grab them when he
  jumps."</p>

  <p>"Well, that isn't the way Burns directed the scene yesterday," Muriel Gay
  contended. "The scene ends where I pick up the bridle."</p>

  <p>"Then Robert Grant Burns doesn't know. I've seen men put on the bridle
  last; but it's wrong. Lite Avery, and everybody who knows&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Muriel Gay looked at Jean with a weary impatience. "What I have to do,"
  she stated, "is what Burns tells me to do. I should worry about it's being
  right or wrong; I'm not the producer."</p>

  <p>Jean faced her, frowning a little. Then she laughed, hung the bridle back
  on the rusty spike, and took down the saddle blanket. "We'll play I'm Robert
  Grant Burns," she said. "I'll tell you what to do: Lay the blanket on
  straight,&mdash;it's shaped to Pard's back, so that ought to be
  easy,&mdash;with the front edge coming forward to his withers; that's not
  right. Maybe I had better do it first, and show you. Then you'll get the
  idea."</p>

  <p>So Jean, with the best intention in the world, saddled Pard, and wondered
  what there was about so simple a process that need puzzle any one. When she
  had tightened the cinch and looped up the latigo, and explained to Muriel
  just what she was doing, she immediately unsaddled him and laid the saddle
  down upon its side, with the blanket folded once on top, and stepped close to
  the manger.</p>

  <p>"If your saddle isn't hanging up, that's the way it should be put on the
  ground," she said. "Now you do it. It's easy."</p>

  <p>It was easy for Jean, but Muriel did not find it so simple. Jean went
  through the whole performance a second time, though she was beginning to feel
  that nature had never fitted her for a teacher of young ladies. Muriel, she
  began to suspect, rather resented the process of being taught. In another
  minute Muriel confirmed the suspicion.</p>

  <p>"I think I've got it now," she said coolly. "Thank you ever so much."</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns returned then, and close behind him rode Gil Huntley
  and those other desperados who had helped to brand the calf that other day.
  Gil was leading a little sorrel with a saddle on,&mdash;Muriel's horse
  evidently. Jean had started back to the house and her own affairs, but she
  lingered with a very human curiosity to see what they were all going to
  do.</p>

  <p>She did not know that Robert Grant Burns was perfectly conscious of her
  presence even when he seemed busiest, and was studying her covertly even when
  he seemed not to notice her at all. Of his company, Pete Lowry was the only
  one who did know it, but that was because Pete himself was trained in the art
  of observation. Pete also knew why Burns was watching Jean and studying her
  slightest movement and expression; and that was why Pete kept smiling that
  little, hidden smile of his, while he made ready for the day's work and
  explained to Jean the mechanical part of making moving-pictures.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather work with live things," said Jean after a while. "But I can
  see where this must be rather fascinating, too."</p>

  <p>"This is working with live things, if anybody wants to know," Pete
  declared. "Wait till you see Burns in action; handling bronks is easy
  compared to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"About where does the side line come, Pete?" Burns interrupted. "If Gil
  stands here and holds the horse for that close-up saddling&mdash;" He whirled
  upon Gil Huntley. "Lead that sorrel up here," he commanded. "We'll have to
  cut off his head so the halter won't show. Now, how's that?"</p>

  <p>This was growing interesting. Jean backed to a convenient pile of old
  corral posts and sat down to watch, with her chin in her palms, and her mind
  weaving shuttle-wise back and forth from one person to another, fitting them
  all into the pattern which made the whole. She watched Robert Grant Burns
  walking back and forth, growling and chuckling by turns as things pleased him
  or did not please him. She watched Muriel Gay walk to a certain spot which
  Burns had previously indicated, show sudden and uncalled-for fear and haste,
  and go through a pantomime of throwing the saddle on the sorrel.</p>

  <p>She watched Lee Milligan carry the saddle up and throw it down upon the
  ground, with skirts curled under and stirrups sprawling.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't leave it that way," she remonstrated. "Lay it on its side!
  You'll have the skirts kinked so it never will set right."</p>

  <p>Muriel Gay gasped and looked from her to Robert Grant Burns. For betraying
  your country and your flag is no crime at all compared with telling your
  director what he must do.</p>

  <p>"Bring that saddle over here," commanded Burns, indicating another spot
  eighteen inches from the first. "And don't slop it down like it was a bundle
  of old clothes. Lay it on its side. How many times have I got to tell you a
  thing before it soaks into your mind?" Not by tone or look or manner did he
  betray any knowledge that Jean had spoken, and Muriel decided that he could
  not have heard.</p>

  <p>Lee Milligan moved the saddle and placed it upon its side, and Burns went
  to the camera and eyed the scene critically for its photographic value. He
  fumbled the script in his hands, cocked an eye upward at the sun, stepped
  back, and gave a last glance to make sure that nothing could be bettered by
  altering the detail.</p>

  <p>"How's Gil; outside the line, Pete? All right. Now, Miss Gay, remember,
  you're in a hurry, and you're worried half to death. You've just time enough
  to get there if you use every second. You were crying when the letter-scene
  closed, and this is about five minutes afterwards; you just had time enough
  to catch your horse and lead him out here to saddle him. Register a sob when
  you turn to pick up the saddle. You ought to do this all right without
  rehearsing. Get into the scene and start your action at the same time. Pete,
  you pick it up just as she gets to the horse's shoulder and starts to turn.
  Don't forget that sob, Gay. Ready? Camera!"</p>

  <p>Jean was absorbed, fascinated by this glimpse into a new and very busy
  little world,&mdash;the world of moving- picture makers. She leaned forward
  and watched every moment, every little detail. "Grab the horn with your right
  hand, Miss Gay!" she cried involuntarily, when Muriel stooped and started to
  pick up the saddle.</p>

  <p>"Don't&mdash;oh, it looks as if you were picking up a wash-boiler! I told
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Register that sob!" bawled Robert Grant Burns, shooting a glance at Jean
  and stepping from one foot to the other like a fat gobbler in fresh-fallen
  snow.</p>

  <p>Muriel registered that sob and a couple more before she succeeded in
  heaving the saddle upon the back of the flinching sorrel. Because she took up
  the saddle by horn and cantle instead of doing it as Jean had taught her, she
  bungled its adjustment upon the horse's back. Then the sorrel began to dance
  away from her, and Robert Grant Burns swore under his breath.</p>

  <p>"Stop the camera!" he barked and waddled irately up to Muriel. "This," he
  observed ironically, "is drama, Miss Gay. We are not making slap-stick comedy
  to-day; and you needn't give an imitation of boosting a barrel over a
  fence."</p>

  <p>Tears that were real slipped down over the rouge and grease paint on
  Muriel's cheeks. "Why don't you make that girl stop butting in?" she flashed
  unexpectedly. "I'm not accustomed to working under two directors!"</p>

  <p>She registered another sob which the camera never got.</p>

  <p>This brought Jean over to where she could lay her hand contritely upon the
  girl's shoulder. "I'm awfully sorry," she drawled with perfect sincerity. "I
  didn't mean to rattle you; but you know you never in the world could throw
  the stirrup over free, the way you had hold of the saddle. I
  thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Burns turned heavily around and looked at Jean, as though he had something
  in his mind to say to her; but, whatever that something may have been, he did
  not say it. Jean looked at him questioningly and walked back to the pile of
  posts.</p>

  <p>"I won't butt in any more," she called out to Muriel. "Only, it does look
  so simple!" She rested her elbows on her knees again, dropped her chin into
  her palms, and concentrated her mind upon the subject of picture-plays in the
  making.</p>

  <p>Muriel recovered her composure, stood beside Gil Huntley at the horse's
  head just outside the range of the camera, waited for the word of command
  from Burns, and rushed into the saddle scene. Burns shouted "Sob!" and Muriel
  sobbed with her face toward the camera. Burns commanded her to pick up the
  saddle, and Muriel picked up the saddle and flung it spitefully upon the back
  of the sorrel.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you forgot the blanket!" exclaimed Jean, and stopped herself with her
  hand over her too-impulsive mouth, just as Burns stopped the camera.</p>

  <p>The director bowed his head and shook it twice slowly and with much
  meaning. He did not say anything at all; no one said anything. Gil Huntley
  looked at Jean and tried to catch her eye, so that he might give her some
  greeting, or at least a glance of understanding. But Jean was wholly
  concerned with the problem which confronted Muriel. It was a shame, she
  thought, to expect a girl,&mdash;and when she had reached that far she
  straightway put the thought into speech, as was her habit.</p>

  <p>"It's a shame to expect that girl to do something she doesn't know how to
  do," she said suddenly to Robert Grant Burns. "Work at something else, why
  don't you, and let me take her somewhere and show her how? It's
  simple&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get up and show her now," snapped Burns, with some sarcasm and a good
  deal of exasperation. "You seem determined to get into the foreground
  somehow; get up and go through that scene and show us how a girl gets a
  saddle on a horse."</p>

  <p>Jean sat still for ten seconds and deliberated while she looked from him
  to the horse. Again she made a picture that drove its elusive quality of
  individuality straight to the professional soul of Robert Grant Burns.</p>

  <p>"I will if you'll let me do it the right way," she said, just when he was
  thinking she would not answer him. She did not wait for his assurance, once
  she had decided to accept the challenge, or the invitation; she did not quite
  know which he had meant it to be.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to bridle him first though," she informed him. "And you can
  tell that star villain to back out of the way. I don't need him."</p>

  <p>Still Burns did not say anything. He was watching her, studying her,
  measuring her, seeing her as she would have looked upon the screen. It was
  his habit to leave people alone until they betrayed their limitations or
  proved their talent; after that, if they remained under his direction, he
  drove them as far as their limitations would permit.</p>

  <p>Jean went first and placed the saddle to her liking upon the ground. "You
  want me to act just as if you were going to take a picture of it, don't you?"
  she asked Burns over her shoulder. She was not sure whether he nodded, but
  she acted upon the supposition that he did, and took the lead-rope from Gil's
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Shall I be hurried and worried&mdash;and shall I sob?" she asked, with
  the little smile at the corners of her eyes and just easing the line of her
  lips.</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns seemed to make a quick decision. "Sure," he said. "You
  saw the action as Miss Gay went through it. Do as she did; only we'll let you
  have your own ideas of saddling the horse." He turned his head toward Pete
  and made a very slight gesture, and Pete grinned. "All ready? Start the
  action!" After that he did not help her by a single suggestion. He tapped
  Pete upon the shoulder, and stood with his feet far apart and his hands on
  his hips, watching her very intently.</p>

  <p>Jean was plainly startled, just at first, by the business-like tone in
  which he gave the signal. Then she laughed a little. "Oh, I forgot. I must be
  hurried and worried&mdash;and I must sob," she corrected herself.</p>

  <p>So she hurried, and every movement she made counted for something
  accomplished. She picked up the bridle and shortened her hold upon the lead
  rope, and discovered that the sorrel had a trick of throwing up his head and
  backing away from the bit. She knew how to deal with that habit, however; but
  in her haste she forgot to look as worried as Muriel had looked, and so
  appeared to her audience as being merely determined. She got the bridle on,
  and then she saddled the sorrel. And for good measure she picked up the
  reins, caught the stirrup and went up, pivoting the horse upon his hind feet
  as though she meant to dash madly off into the distance. But she only went a
  couple of rods before she pulled him up sharply and dismounted.</p>

  <p>"That didn't take me long, did it?" she asked. "I could have hurried a lot
  more if I had known the horse." Then she stopped dead still and looked at
  Robert Grant Burns.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my goodness, I forgot to sob!" she gasped. And she caught her hat
  brim and pulling her Stetson more firmly down upon her head, turned and ran
  up the path to the house, and shut herself into her room.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">XII. &mdash; TO "DOUBLE" FOR MURIEL GAY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHILE she breakfasted unsatisfactorily upon soda crackers
  and a bottle of olives which happened to have been left over from a previous
  luncheon, Jean meditated deeply upon the proper beginning of a book. The
  memory of last night came to her vividly, and she smiled while she fished
  with a pair of scissors for an olive. She would start the book off weirdly
  with mysterious sounds in an empty room. That, she argued, should fix firmly
  the interest of the reader right at the start.</p>

  <p>By the time she had fished the olive from the bottle, however, her
  thoughts swung from the artistic to the material aspect of those mysterious
  footsteps. What had the man wanted or expected to find? She set down the
  olive bottle impulsively and went out and around to the kitchen door and
  opened it. In spite of herself, she shuddered as she went in, and she walked
  close to the wall until she was well past the brown stain on the floor. She
  went to the old-fashioned cupboard and examined the contents of the drawers
  and looked into a cigar-box which stood open upon the top. She went into her
  father's bedroom and looked through everything, which did not take long,
  since the room had little left in it. She went into the living-room, also
  depressingly dusty and forlorn, but try as she would to think of some article
  that might have been left there and was now wanted by some one, she could
  imagine no reason whatever for that nocturnal visit. At the same time, there
  must have been a reason. Men of that country did not ride abroad during the
  still hours of the night just for the love of riding. Most of them went to
  bed at dark and slept until dawn.</p>

  <p>She went out, intending to go back to her literary endeavors; if she never
  started that book, certainly it would never make her rich, and she would
  never be able to make war upon circumstances. She thought of her father with
  a twinge of remorse because she had wasted so much time this morning, and she
  scarcely glanced toward the picture-people down by the corrals, so she did
  not see that Robert Grant Burns turned to look at her and then started
  hurriedly up the path to the house.</p>

  <p>"Say," he called, just before she disappeared around the corner. "Wait a
  minute. I want to talk to you."</p>

  <p>Jean waited, and the fat man came up breathing hard because of his haste
  in the growing heat of the forenoon.</p>

  <p>"Say, I'd like to use you in a few scenes," he began abruptly when he
  reached her. "Gay can't put over the stuff I want; and I'd like to have you
  double for her in some riding and roping scenes. You're about the same size
  and build, and I'll get you a blond wig for close-ups, like that saddling
  scene. I believe you've got it in you to make good on the screen; anyway, the
  practice you'll get doubling for Gay won't do you any harm."</p>

  <p>Jean looked at him, tempted to consent for the fun there would be in it.
  "I'd like to," she told him after a little silence. "I really would love it.
  But I've got some work that I must do."</p>

  <p>"Let the work wait," urged Burns, relieved because she showed no
  resentment against the proposal. "I want to get this picture made. It's going
  to be a hummer. There's punch to it, or there will be, if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you see," Jean's drawl slipped across his eager, domineering voice,
  "I have to earn some money, lots of it. There's something I need it for.
  It's&mdash; important."</p>

  <p>"You'll earn money at this," he told her bluntly. "You didn't think I'd
  ask you to work for nothing, I hope. I ain't that cheap. It's like this: If
  you'll work in this picture and put over what I want, it'll be feature stuff.
  I'll pay accordingly. Of course, I can't say just how much,&mdash;this is
  just a try-out; you understand that. But if you can deliver the goods, I'll
  see that you get treated right. Some producers might play the cheap game just
  because you're green; but I ain't that kind, and my company ain't that kind.
  I'm out after results." Involuntarily his eyes turned toward the bluff.
  "There's a ride down the bluff that I want, and a roping&mdash;say, can you
  throw a rope?"</p>

  <p>Jean laughed. "Lite Avery says I can," she told him, "and Lite Avery can
  almost write his name in the air with a rope."</p>

  <p>"If you can make that dash down the bluff, and do the roping I want,
  why&mdash;Lord! You'll have to be working a gold mine to beat what I'd be
  willing to pay for the stuff."</p>

  <p>"There's no place here in the coulee where you can ride down the bluff,"
  Jean informed him, "except back of the house, and that's out of sight.
  Farther over there's a kind of trail that a good horse can handle. I came
  down it on a run, once, with Pard. A man was drowning, over here in the
  creek, and I was up on the bluff and happened to see him and his horse turn
  over&mdash;it was during the high water. So I made a run down off the point,
  and got to him in time to rope him out. You might use that trail."</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns stood and stared at her as though he did not see her at
  all. In truth, he was seeing with his professional eyes a picture of that
  dash down the bluff. He was seeing a "close-up" of Jean whirling her loop and
  lassoing the drowning man just as he had given up hope and was going under
  for the third time. Lee Milligan was the drowning man! and the agony of his
  eyes, and the tenseness of Jean's face, made Robert Grant Burns draw a long
  breath.</p>

  <p>"Lord, what feature-stuff that would make!" he said under his breath.
  "I'll write a scenario around that rescue scene." Whereupon he caught
  himself. It is not well for a director to permit his enthusiasm to carry him
  into injudicious speech. He chuckled to hide his eagerness. "Well, you can
  show me that location," he said, "and we'll get to work. You'll have to use
  the sorrel, of course; but I guess he'll be all right. This saddling scene
  will have to wait till I send for a wig. You can change clothes with Miss Gay
  and get by all right at a distance, just as you are. A little make-up, maybe;
  she'll fix that. Come on, let's get to work. And don't worry about the
  salary; I'll tell you to-night what it'll be, after I see you work."</p>

  <p>When he was in that mood, Robert Grant Burns swept everything before him.
  He swept Jean into his plans before she had really made up her mind whether
  to accept his offer or stick to her literary efforts. He had Muriel Gay up at
  the house and preparing to change clothes with Jean, and he had Lee Milligan
  started for town in the machine with the key to Burns' emergency wardrobe
  trunk, before Jean realized that she was actually going to do things for the
  camera to make into a picture.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you are going to double in that ride down the bluff, anyway,"
  Muriel declared, while she blacked Jean's brows and put shadows around her
  eyes. "I could have done it, of course; but mamma is so nervous about my
  getting hurt that I hate to do anything risky like that. It upsets her for
  days."</p>

  <p>"There isn't much risk in riding down the bluff," said Jean carelessly.
  "Not if you've got a good horse. I wonder if that sorrel is rope broke. Have
  you ever roped off him?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Muriel, "I haven't." She might have added that she never roped
  off any horse, but she did not.</p>

  <p>"I'll have to try him out and see what he's like, before I try to rope for
  a picture. I wonder if there'll be time now?" Jean was pleasantly excited
  over this new turn of events. She had dreamed of doing many things, but never
  of helping to make moving pictures. She was eager and full of curiosity, like
  a child invited to play a new and fascinating game, and she kept wondering
  what Lite would have to say about her posing for moving pictures. Try to stop
  her, probably,&mdash;and fail, as usual!</p>

  <p>When she went out to where the others were grouped in the shade, she gave
  no sign of any inner excitement or perturbation. She went straight up to
  Burns and waited for his verdict.</p>

  <p>"Do I look like Miss Gay?" she drawled.</p>

  <p>The keen eyes of Burns half closed while he studied her.</p>

  <p>"No, I can't say that you do," he said after a moment. "Walk off toward
  the corrals,&mdash;and, say! Mount the sorrel and start off like you were in
  a deuce of a hurry. That'll be one scene, and I'd like to see how you do it
  when you can have your own way about it, and how close up we can make it and
  have you pass for Gay."</p>

  <p>"How far shall I ride?" Jean's eyes had a betraying light of interest.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;to the gate, maybe. Can you get a long shot down the trail to
  the gate, Pete, and keep skyline in the scene?"</p>

  <p>Pete moved the camera, fussed and squinted, and then nodded his head.
  "Sure, I can. But you'll have to make it right away, or else wait till
  to-morrow. The sun's getting around pretty well in front."</p>

  <p>"We'll take it right after this rehearsal, if the girl can put the stuff
  over right," Burns muttered. "And she can, or I'm badly mistaken. Pete, that
  girl's&mdash;" He stopped short, because the shadow of Lee Milligan was
  moving up to them. "All right, Miss&mdash;say, what's your name, anyway?" He
  was told, and went on briskly. "Miss Douglas, just start from off that
  way,&mdash;about where that round rock is. You'll come into the scene a
  little beyond. Hurry straight up to the sorrel and mount and ride off. Your
  lover is going to be trapped by the bandits, and you've just heard it and are
  hurrying to save him. Get the idea? Now let's see you do it."</p>

  <p>"You don't want me to sob, do you?" Jean looked over her shoulder to
  inquire. "Because if I were going to save my lover, I don't believe I'd want
  to waste time weeping around all over the place."</p>

  <p>Burns chuckled. "You can cut out the sob," he permitted. "Just go ahead
  like it was real stuff."</p>

  <p>Jean was standing by the rock, ready to start. She looked at Burns
  speculatively. "Oh, well, if it were real, I'd run!"</p>

  <p>"Go ahead and run then!" Burns commanded.</p>

  <p>Run she did, and startled the sorrel so that it took quick work to catch
  him.</p>

  <p>"Camera! She might not do it like that again, ever!" cried Burns.</p>

  <p>She was up in the saddle and gone in a flurry of dusts while Robert Grant
  Burns stood with his hands on his hips and watched her gloatingly.</p>

  <p>"Lord! But that girl's a find!" he ejaculated, and this time he did not
  seem to care who heard him. He cut the scene just as Jean pulled up at the
  gate. "See how she set that sorrel down on his haunches?" he chuckled to
  Pete. "Talk about feature-stuff; that girl will jump our releases up ten per
  cent., Pete, with the punches I can put into Gay's parts now. How many feet
  was that scene, twenty-five?"</p>

  <p>"Fifteen," corrected Pete. "And every foot with a punch in it. Too bad
  she's got to double for Gay. She's got the face for close-up work, believe
  me!"</p>

  <p>To this tentative remark Robert Grant Burns made no reply whatever. He
  went off down the path to meet Jean, critically watching her approach to see
  how nearly she resembled Muriel Gay, and how close she could come to the
  camera without having the substitution betrayed upon the screen. Muriel Gay
  was a leading woman with a certain assured following among movie audiences.
  Daring horsewomanship would greatly increase that following, and therefore
  the financial returns of these Western pictures. Burns was her director, and
  it was to his interest to build up her popularity. Since the idea first
  occurred to him, therefore, of using Jean as a substitute for Muriel in all
  the scenes that required nerve and skill in riding, he looked upon her as a
  double for Muriel rather than from the viewpoint of her own individual
  possibilities on the screen.</p>

  <p>"I don't know about your hair," he told her, when she came up to him and
  stopped. "We'll run the negative to-night and see how it shows up. The rest
  of the scene was all right. I had Pete make it. I'm going to take some scenes
  down here by the gate, now, with the boys. I won't need you till after lunch,
  probably; then I'll have you make that ride down off the bluff and some
  close-up rope work."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I ought to ride over to the ranch," Jean said undecidedly. "And
  I ought to try out this sorrel if you want me to use him. Would some other
  day do just&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In the picture business," interrupted Robert Grant Burns dictatorially,
  "the working-hours of an actor belong to the director he's working for. If I
  use you in pictures, your time will belong to me on the days when I use you.
  I'll expect you to be on hand when I want you; get that?"</p>

  <p>"My time," said Jean resolutely, "will belong to you if I consider it
  worth my while to let you have it. Otherwise it will belong to me."</p>

  <p>Burns chuckled. "Well, we might as well get down to brass tacks and have
  things thoroughly understood," he decided. "I'll use you as an extra to
  double for Miss Gay where there's any riding stunts and so on. Miss Gay is a
  good actress, but she can't ride to amount to anything. With the clothes and
  make-up you&mdash; impersonate her. See what I mean? And for straight riding
  I'll pay you five dollars a day; five dollars for your time on the days that
  I want to use you. For any feature stuff, like that ride down the bluff, and
  the roping, and the like of that, it'll be more. Twenty- five dollars for
  feature-stuff, say, and five dollars for straight riding. Get me?"</p>

  <p>"I do, yes." Jean's drawl gave no hint of her inner elation at the
  prospect of earning so much money so easily. What, she wondered, would Lite
  say to that?</p>

  <p>"Well, that part's all right then. By feature-stuff, I mean anything I
  want you to do to put a punch in the story; anything from riding bucking
  horses and shooting&mdash;say can you shoot?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think so."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll have use for that, too, later on. The more stunts you can pull
  off, the bigger hits these pictures are going to make. You see that, of
  course. And what I've offered you is a pretty good rate; but I expect to get
  results. I told you I wasn't any cheap John to work for. Now get this point,
  and get it right: I'll expect you to report to me every morning here, at
  eight o'clock. I may need you that day and I may not, but you're to be on
  hand. If I do need you, you get paid for that day, whether it's one scene or
  twenty you're to work in. If I don't need you that day, you don't get
  anything. That's what being an extra means. You start in to-day, and if you
  make the ride down the bluff, it'll be twenty-five to-day. But you can't go
  riding off somewhere else, and maybe not be here when I want you. You're
  under my orders, like the rest of the company. Get that?"</p>

  <p>"I'll try it for a week, anyway," she said. "Obeying your orders will be
  the hardest part of it, Mr. Burns. I always want to stamp my foot and say `I
  won't' when any one tells me I must do something." She laughed infectiously.
  "You'll probably fire me before the week's out," she prophesied. "I'll be as
  meek as possible, but if we quarrel,&mdash;well, you know how sweet-tempered
  I can be!"</p>

  <p>Burns looked at her queerly and laughed. "I'll take a chance on that," he
  said, and went chuckling back to the camera. To have a girl absolutely ignore
  his position and authority, and treat him in that off-hand manner of equality
  was a new experience to Robert Grant Burns, terror among photo-players.</p>

  <p>Jean went over to where Muriel and her mother were sitting in the shade,
  and asked Muriel if she would like to ride Pard out into the flat beyond the
  corrals, where she meant to try out the sorrel.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to use you, anyway," she added frankly, "to practice on. You can
  ride past, you know, and let me rope you. Oh, it won't hurt you; and there'll
  be no risk at all," she hastened to assure the other, when she saw refusal in
  Muriel's eyes. "I'll not take any turns around the horn, you know."</p>

  <p>"I don't want Muriel taking risks like that," put in Mrs. Gay hastily.
  "That's just why Burns is going to have you double for her. A leading woman
  can't afford to get hurt. Muriel, you stay here and rest while you have a
  chance. Goodness knows it's hard enough, at best, to work under Burns."</p>

  <p>Jean looked at her and turned away. So that was it&mdash;a leading woman
  could not afford to be hurt! Some one else, who didn't amount to anything,
  must take the risks. She had received her first little lesson in this new
  business.</p>

  <p>She went straight to Burns, interrupted him in coaching his chief villain
  for a scene, and asked him if he could spare a man for half an hour or so. "I
  want some one to throw a rope over on the run," she explained naively, "to
  try out this sorrel."</p>

  <p>Burns regarded her somberly; he hated to be interrupted in his work.</p>

  <p>"Ain't there anybody else you can rope?" he wanted to know. "Where's
  Gay?"</p>

  <p>"`A leading woman,'" quoted Jean serenely, "`can't afford to get
  hurt!'"</p>

  <p>Burns chuckled. He knew who was the author of that sentence; he had heard
  it before. "Well, if you're as fatal as all that, I can't turn over my
  leading man for you to practice on, either," he pointed out to her. "What's
  the matter with a calf or something?"</p>

  <p>"You won't let me ride out of your sight to round one up," Jean retorted.
  "There are no calves handy; that's why I asked for a man."</p>

  <p>Whereupon the villains looked at one another queerly, and the chuckle of
  their director exploded into a full- lunged laugh.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to use all these fellows in a couple of scenes," he told her.
  "Can't you practice on a post?"</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> don't have to practice. It's the sorrel I want to try out."
  Jean's voice lost a little of its habitual, soft drawl. Really, these
  picture-people did seem very dense upon some subjects!</p>

  <p>"Well, now look here." Robert Grant Burns caught at the shreds of his
  domineering manner. "My part of this business is producing the scenes. You'll
  have to attend to the getting-ready part. You&mdash;you wouldn't expect me to
  help you put on your make-up, would you?"</p>

  <p>"No, now that I recognize your limitations, I shall not ask any help which
  none of you are able or have the nerve to give," she returned coolly. "I wish
  I had Lite here; but I guess Pard and I can handle the sorrel ourselves.
  Sorry to have disturbed you."</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns, his leading man and all his villains stood and watched
  her walk away from them to the stable. They watched her lead Pard out and
  turn him loose in the biggest corral. When they saw her take her coiled rope,
  mount the sorrel and ride in, they went, in a hurried group, to where they
  might look into that corral. They watched her pull the gate shut after her,
  lean from the saddle, and fasten the chain hook in its accustomed link. By
  the time she had widened her loop and turned to charge down upon unsuspecting
  Pard, Robert Grant Burns, his leading man and all his villains were lined up
  along the widest space between the corral rails, and Pete Lowry was running
  over so as to miss none of the show.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I thought you were all so terribly busy!" taunted Jean, while her
  loop was circling over her head. Pard wheeled just then upon his hind feet,
  but the loop settled true over his head and drew tight against his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>The sorrel lunged and fought the rope, and snorted and reared. It took
  fully two minutes for Jean to force him close enough to Pard so that she
  might flip off the loop. Pard himself caught the excitement and snorted and
  galloped wildly round and round the enclosure, but Jean did not mind that;
  what brought her lips so tightly together was the performance of the sorrel.
  While she was coiling her rope, he was making half-hearted buck jumps across
  the corral. When she swished the rope through the air to widen her loop, he
  reared and whirled. She jabbed him smartly with the spurs, and he kicked
  forward at her feet.</p>

  <p>"Say," she drawled to Burns, "I don't know what sort of a picture you're
  going to make, but if you want any roping done from this horse, you'll have
  to furnish meals and beds for your audiences." With that she was off across
  the corral at a tearing pace that made the watchers gasp. The sorrel swung
  clear of the fence. He came near going down in a heap, but recovered himself
  after scrambling along on his knees. Jean brought him to a stand before
  Burns.</p>

  <p>"I'll have to ask you to raise your price, Mr. Burns, if you want me to
  run this animal down the bluff," she stated firmly. "He's just what I thought
  he was all along: a ride-around-the-block horse from some livery stable. When
  it comes to range work, he doesn't know as much as&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Some people. I get you," Burns cut in drily. "How about that horse of
  yours? Would you be willing to let me have the use of him&mdash;at so much
  per?"</p>

  <p>"If I do the riding, yes. Now, since you're here, and don't seem as busy
  as you thought you were, I'll show you the difference between this
  livery-stable beast and a real rope-horse."</p>

  <p>She dismounted and called to Pard, and Pard came to her, stepping warily
  because of the sorrel and the rope. "Just to save time, will one of you boys
  go and bring my riding outfit from the stable?" she asked the line at the
  fence, whereupon the leading man and all the villains started unanimously to
  perform that slight service, which shows pretty well how Jean stood in their
  estimation.</p>

  <p>"Now, that's a real, typical, livery-stable saddle and bridle," she
  observed to Burns, pointing scornfully at the sorrel. "I was going to tell
  you that I'd hate to be seen in a picture riding that outfit, anyway. Now,
  you watch how differently Pard behaves with a rope and everything. And you
  watch the sorrel get what's coming to him. Shall I `bust' him?"</p>

  <p>"You mean throw him?" Burns, in his eagerness, began to climb the corral
  fence,&mdash;until he heard a rail crack under his weight. "Yes, BUST him, if
  you want to. John Jimpson! if you can rope and throw that sorrel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jean did not reply to that half-finished sentence. She was busy saddling
  Pard; now she mounted and widened her loop with a sureness of the result that
  flashed a thrill of expectation to her audience. Twice the loop circled over
  her head before she flipped it out straight and true toward the frantic
  sorrel as he surged by. She caught him fairly by both front feet and swung
  Pard half away from him. Pard's muscles stiffened against the jerk of the
  rope, and the sorrel went down with a bump. Pard backed knowingly and braced
  himself like the trained rope-horse he was, and Jean looked at Robert Grant
  Burns and laughed.</p>

  <p>"I didn't bust him," she disclaimed whimsically. "He done busted himself!"
  She touched Pard with her heel and rode up so that the rope slackened, and
  she could throw off the loop. "Did you see how Pard set himself?" she
  questioned eagerly. "I could have gotten off and gone clear away, and Pard
  would have kept that horse from getting on his feet. Now you see the
  difference, don't you? Pard never would have gone down like that."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you'll do," chuckled Robert Grant Burns, "I'll pay you a little more
  and use you and your horse together. Call that settled. Come on, boys, let's
  get to work."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">XIII. &mdash; PICTURES AND PLANS AND MYSTERIOUS
     FOOTSTEPS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Lite objected to her staying altogether at the Lazy A,
  Jean assured him that she was being terribly practical and cautious and
  businesslike, and pointed out to him that staying there would save Pard and
  herself the trip back and forth each day, and would give her time, mornings
  and evenings to work on her book.</p>

  <p>Lite, of course, knew all about that soon-to-be-famous book. He usually
  did know nearly everything that concerned Jean or held her interest. Whether,
  after three years of futile attempts, Lite still felt himself entitled to be
  called Jean's boss, I cannot say for a certainty. He had grown rather silent
  upon that subject, and rather inclined to keep himself in the background, as
  Jean grew older and more determined in her ways. But certainly he was Jean's
  one confidential friend,&mdash; her pal. So Lite, perforce, listened while
  Jean told him the plot of her story. And when she asked him in all
  earnestness what he thought would be best for the tragic element, ghosts or
  Indians, Lite meditated gravely upon the subject and then suggested that she
  put in both. That is why Jean lavishly indulged in mysterious footsteps all
  through the first chapter, and then opened the second with blood-curdling
  war-whoops that chilled the soul of her heroine and led her to suspect that
  the rocks behind the cabin concealed the forms of painted savages.</p>

  <p>Her imagination must have been stimulated by her new work, which called
  for wild rides after posses and wilder flights away from the outlaws, while
  the flash of blank cartridges and the smoke-pots of disaster by fire added
  their spectacular effect to a scene now and then.</p>

  <p>Jean, of course, was invariably the wild rider who fled in a blond wig and
  Muriel's clothes from pursuing villains, or dashed up to the sheriff's office
  to give the alarm. Frequently she fired the blank cartridges, until Lite
  warned her that blank cartridges would ruin her gun-barrel; after which she
  insisted upon using bullets, to the secret trepidation of the villains who
  must stand before her and who could never quite grasp the fact that Jean knew
  exactly where those bullets were going to land.</p>

  <p>She would sit in her room at the Lazy A, when the sun and the big, black
  automobile and the painted workers were gone, and write feverishly of ghosts
  and Indians and the fair maiden who endured so much and the brave hero who
  dared so much and loved so well. Lee Milligan she visualized as the human
  wolf who looked with desire upon Lillian. Gil Huntley became the hero as the
  story unfolded; and while I have told you absolutely nothing about Jean's
  growing acquaintance with these two, you may draw your own conclusions from
  the place she made for them in her book that she was writing. And you may
  also form some idea of what Lite Avery was living through, during those days
  when his work and his pride held him apart, and Jean did "stunts" to her
  heart's content with these others.</p>

  <p>A letter from the higher-ups in the Great Western Company, written just
  after a trial run of the first picture wherein Jean had worked, had served to
  stimulate Burns' appetite for the spectacular, so that the stunts became more
  and more the features of his pictures. Muriel Gay was likely to become the
  most famous photo- play actress in the West, he believed. That is, she would
  if Jean continued to double for her in everything save the straight dramatic
  work.</p>

  <p>Jean did not care just at that time how much glory Muriel Gay was
  collecting for work that Jean herself had done. Jean was experiencing the
  first thrills of seeing her name written upon the face of fat, weekly checks
  that promised the fulfillment of her hopes, and she would not listen to Lite
  when he ventured a remonstrance against some of the things she told him about
  doing. Jean was seeing the Lazy A restored to its old- time home-like
  prosperity. She was seeing her dad there, going tranquilly about the everyday
  business of the ranch, holding his head well up, and looking every man
  straight in the eye. She could not and she would not let even Lite persuade
  her to give up risking her neck for the money the risk would bring her.</p>

  <p>If she could change these dreams to reality by dashing madly about on Pard
  while Pete Lowry wound yards and yards of narrow gray film around something
  on the inside of his camera, and watched her with that little, secret smile
  on his face; and while Robert Grant Burns waddled here and there with his
  hands on his hips, and watched her also; and while villains pursued or else
  fled before her, and Lee Milligan appeared furiously upon the scene in
  various guises to rescue her,&mdash;if she could win her dad's freedom and
  the Lazy A's possession by doing these foolish things, she was perfectly
  willing to risk her neck and let Muriel receive the applause.</p>

  <p>She did not know that she was doubling the profit on these Western
  pictures which Robert Grant Burns was producing. She did not know that it
  would have hastened the attainment of her desires had her name appeared in
  the cast as the girl who put the "punches" in the plays. She did not know
  that she was being cheated of her rightful reward when her name never
  appeared anywhere save on the pay-roll and the weekly checks which seemed to
  her so magnificently generous. In her ignorance of what Gil Huntley called
  the movie game, she was perfectly satisfied to give the best service of which
  she was capable, and she never once questioned the justice of Robert Grant
  Burns.</p>

  <p>Jean started a savings account in the little bank where her father had
  opened an account before she was born, and Lite was made to writhe inwardly
  with her boasting. Lite, if you please, had long ago started a savings
  account at that same bank, and had lately cut out poker, and even pool, from
  among his joys, that his account might fatten the faster. He had the same
  object which Jean had lately adopted so zealously, but he did not tell her
  these things. He listened instead while Jean read gloatingly her balance, and
  talked of what she would do when she had enough saved to buy back the ranch.
  She had stolen unwittingly the air castle which Lite had been three years
  building, but he did not say a word about it to Jean. Wistful eyed, but
  smiling with his lips, he would sit while Jean spoiled whole sheets of
  perfectly good story-paper, just figuring and estimating and building castles
  with the dollar sign. If Robert Grant Burns persisted in his mania for
  "feature-stuff" and "punches" in his pictures, Jean believed that she would
  have a fair start toward buying back the Lazy A long before her book was
  published and had brought her the thousands and thousands of dollars she was
  sure it would bring. Very soon she could go boldly to a lawyer and ask him to
  do something about her father's case. Just what he should do she did not
  quite know; and Lite did not seem to be able to tell her, but she thought she
  ought to find out just how much the trial had cost. And she wished she knew
  how to get about setting some one on the trail of Art Osgood.</p>

  <p>Jean was sure that Art Osgood knew something about the murder, and she
  frequently tried to make Lite agree with her. Sometimes she was sure that Art
  Osgood was the murderer, and would argue and point out her reasons to Lite.
  Art had been working for her uncle, and rode often to the Lazy A. He had not
  been friendly with Johnny Croft,&mdash;but then, nobody had been very
  friendly with Johnny Croft. Still, Art Osgood was less friendly with Johnny
  than most of the men in the country, and just after the murder he had left
  the country. Jean laid a good deal of stress upon the circumstance of Art
  Osgood's leaving on that particular afternoon, and she seemed to resent it
  because no one had tried to find Art. No one had seemed to think his going at
  that time had any significance, or any bearing upon the murder, because he
  had been planning to leave, and had announced that he would go that day.</p>

  <p>Jean's mind, as her bank account grew steadily to something approaching
  dignity, worked back and forth incessantly over the circumstances surrounding
  the murder, in spite of Lite's peculiar attitude toward the subject, which
  Jean felt but could not understand, since he invariably assured her that he
  believed her dad was innocent, when she asked him outright.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, in the throes of literary composition, she could not think of
  the word that she wanted. Her eyes then would wander around familiar objects
  in the shabby little room, and frequently they would come to rest upon her
  father's saddle or her father's chaps: the chaps especially seemed potent
  reminders of her father, and drew her thoughts to him and held them there.
  The worn leather, stained with years of hard usage and wrinkled permanently
  where they had shaped themselves to his legs in the saddle, brought his big,
  bluff presence vividly before her, when she was in a certain receptive mood.
  She would forget all about her story, and the riding and shooting and roping
  she had done that day to appease the clamorous, professional appetite of
  Robert Grant Burns, and would sit and stare, and think and think. Always her
  thoughts traveled in a wide circle and came back finally to the starting
  point: to free her father, and to give him back his home, she must have
  money. To have money, she must earn it; she must work for it. So then she
  would give a great sigh of relaxed nervous tension and go back to her heroine
  and the Indians and the mysterious footsteps that marched on moonlight nights
  up and down a long porch just outside windows that frequently framed white,
  scared faces with wide, horror-stricken eyes which saw nothing of the
  marcher, though the steps still went up and down.</p>

  <p>It was very creepy, in spots. It was so creepy that one evening when Lite
  had come to smoke a cigarette or two in her company and to listen to her
  account of the day's happenings, Lite noticed that when she read the creepy
  passages in her story, she glanced frequently over her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You want to cut out this story writing," he said abruptly, when she
  paused to find the next page. "It's bad enough to work like you do in the
  pictures. This is going a little too strong; you're as jumpy to-night as a
  guilty conscience. Cut it out."</p>

  <p>"I'm all right. I'm just doing that for dramatic effect. This is very
  weird, Lite. I ought to have a green shade on the lamp, to get the proper
  effect. I&mdash; don't you think&mdash;er&mdash;those footsteps are terribly
  mysterious?"</p>

  <p>Lite looked at her sharply for a minute. "I sure do," he said drily.
  "Where did you get the idea, Jean?"</p>

  <p>"Out of my head," she told him airily, and went on reading while Lite
  studied her curiously.</p>

  <p>That night Jean awoke and heard stealthy footsteps, like a man walking in
  his socks and no boots, going all through the house but never coming to her
  room. She did not get up to see who it was, but lay perfectly still and heard
  her heart thump. When she saw a dim, yellow ray of light under the door which
  opened into the kitchen, she drew the blanket over her head, and got no
  comfort whatever from the feel of her six-shooter close against her hand.</p>

  <p>The next morning she told herself that she had given in to a fine case of
  nerves, and that the mysterious footsteps of her story had become mixed up
  with the midnight wanderings of a pack-rat that had somehow gotten into the
  house. Then she remembered the bar of light under the door, and the pack-rat
  theory was spoiled.</p>

  <p>She had taken the board off the doorway into the kitchen, so that she
  could use the cookstove. The man could have come in if he had wanted to, and
  that knowledge she found extremely disquieting. She went all through the
  house that morning, looking and wondering. The living-room was now the
  dressing-room of Muriel and her mother, and the make-up scattered over the
  centertable was undisturbed; the wardrobe of the two women had apparently
  been left untouched. Yet she was sure that some one had been prowling in
  there in the night. She gave up the puzzle at last and went back to her
  breakfast, but before the company arrived in the big, black automobile, she
  had found a stout hasp and two staples, and had fixed the door which led from
  her room into the kitchen so that she could fasten it securely on the
  inside.</p>

  <p>Jean did not tell Lite about the footsteps. She was afraid that he might
  insist upon her giving up staying at the Lazy A. Lite did not approve of it,
  anyway, and it would take very little encouragement in the way of extra risk
  to make him stubborn about it. Lite could be very obstinate indeed upon
  occasion, and she was afraid he might take a stubborn streak about this, and
  perhaps ride over every night to make sure she was all right, or do something
  equally unnecessary and foolish.</p>

  <p>She did not know Lite as well as she imagined, which is frequently the
  case with the closest of friends. As a matter of fact, Jean had never spent
  one night alone on the ranch, even though she did believe she was doing so.
  Lite had a homestead a few miles away, upon which he was supposed to be
  sleeping occasionally to prove his good faith in the settlement. Instead of
  spending his nights there, however, he rode over and slept in the gable loft
  over the old granary, where no one ever went; and he left every morning just
  before the sky lightened with dawn. He did not know that Jean was frightened
  by the sound of footsteps, but he had heard the man ride up to the stable and
  dismount, and he had followed him to the house and watched him through the
  uncurtained windows, and had kept his fingers close to his gun all the while.
  Jean did not dream of anything like that; but Lite, going about his work with
  the easy calm that marked his manner always, was quite as puzzled over the
  errand of the night-prowler as was Jean herself.</p>

  <p>For three years Lite had lain aside the mystery of the footprints on the
  kitchen floor on the night after the inquest, as a puzzle he would probably
  never solve. He had come to remember them as a vagrant incident that carried
  no especial meaning. But now they seemed to carry a new
  significance,&mdash;if only he could get at the key. For three years he had
  gone along quietly, working and saving all he could, and looking after Jean
  in an unobtrusive way, believing that Aleck was guilty,&mdash; and being
  careful to give no hint of that belief to any one. And now Jean herself
  seemed to be leading him unconsciously face to face with doubt and mystery.
  It tantalized him. He knew the prowler, and for that reason he was all the
  more puzzled. What had he wanted or expected to find? Lite was tempted to
  face the man and ask him; but on second thought he knew that would be
  foolish. He would say nothing to Jean. He thanked the Lord she slept soundly!
  and he would wait and see what happened.</p>

  <p>Jean herself was thoughtful all that day, and was slow to lighten her mood
  or her manner even when Gil Huntley rode beside her to location and talked
  enthusiastically of the great work she was doing for a beginner, and of the
  greater work she would do in the future, if only she took advantage of her
  opportunities.</p>

  <p>"It can't go on like this forever," he told her impressively for the
  second time, before he was sure of her attention and her interest. "Think of
  you, working extra under a three-day guarantee! Why, you're what's making the
  pictures! I had a letter from a friend of mine; he's with the Universal. He'd
  been down to see one of our pictures,&mdash;that first one you worked in. You
  remember how you came down off that bluff, and how you roped me and jerked me
  down off the bank just as I'd got a bead on Lee? Say! that picture was a
  RIOT! Gloomy says he never saw a picture get the hand that scene got. And he
  wanted to know who was doubling for Gay, up here. You see, he got next that
  it was a double; he knows darned well Gay never could put over that line of
  stuff. The photography was dandy,&mdash;Pete's right there when it comes to
  camera work, anyway,&mdash;and that run down the bluff, he said, had people
  standing on their hind legs even before the rope scene. You could tell it was
  a girl and no man doubling the part. Gloomy says everybody around the studio
  has begun to watch for our releases, and go just to see you ride and rope and
  shoot. And Gay gets all the press-notices! Say, it makes me sick!" He looked
  at Jean wistfully.</p>

  <p>"The trouble is, you don't realize what a raw deal you're getting," he
  said, with much discontent in his tone. "As an extra, you're getting fine
  treatment and fine pay; I admit that. But the point is, you've no business
  being an extra. Where you belong is playing leads. You don't know what that
  means, but I do. Burns is just using you to boost Muriel Gay, and I say it's
  the rawest deal I ever saw handed out in the picture game; and believe me,
  I've seen some raw deals!"</p>

  <p>"Now, now, don't get peevish, Gil." Jean's drawl was soft, and her eyes
  were friendly and amused. So far had their friendship progressed. "It's
  awfully dear of you to want to see me a real leading lady. I appreciate it,
  and I won't take off that lock of hair I said I'd take when I shoot you in
  the foreground. Burns wants a real thrilling effect close up, and he's told
  me five times to remember and keep my face turned away from the camera, so
  they won't see it isn't Gay. If I turn around, there will have to be a
  re-take, he says; and you won't like that, Gil, not after you've heard a
  bullet zip past your ear so close that it will fan your hair.
  Are&mdash;aren't you afraid of me, Gil?"</p>

  <p>"Afraid of you?" Gil's horse swung closer, and Gil's eyes threatened the
  opening of a tacitly forbidden subject.</p>

  <p>"Because if you get nervous and move the least little bit&mdash; To make
  it look real, as Bobby described the scene to me, I've got to shoot the
  instant you stop to gather yourself for a spring at me. It's that lightning-
  draw business I have to do, Gil. I'm to stand three quarters to the camera,
  with my face turned away, watching you. You keep coming, and you stop just an
  instant when you're almost within reach of me. In that instant I have to grab
  my gun and shoot; and it has to look as if I got you, Gil. I've got to come
  pretty close, in order to bring the gun in line with you for the camera.
  Bobby wants to show off the quick draw that Lite Avery taught me. That's to
  be the `punch' in the scene. I showed him this morning what it is like, and
  Bobby is just tickled to death. You see, I don't shoot the way they usually
  do in pictures&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I should say not!" Gil interrupted admiringly.</p>

  <p>"You haven't seen that quick work, either. It'll look awfully real, Gil,
  and you mustn't dodge or duck, whatever you do. It will be just as if you
  really were a man I'm deadly afraid of, that has me cornered at last against
  that ledge. I'm going to do it as if I meant it. That will mean that when you
  stop and kind of measure the distance, meaning to grab me before I can do
  anything, I'll draw and shoot from the level of my belt; no higher, Gil, or
  it won't be the lightning-draw&mdash;as advertised. I won't have time to take
  a fine aim, you know."</p>

  <p>"Listen!" said Gil, leaning toward her with his eyes very earnest. "I know
  all about that. I heard you and Burns talking about it. You go ahead and
  shoot, and put that scene over big. Don't you worry about me; I'm going to
  play up to you, if I can. Listen! Pete's just waiting for a chance to
  register your face on the film. Burns has planned his scenes to prevent that,
  but we're just lying low till the chance comes. It's got to be dramatic, and
  it's got to seem accidental. Get me? I shouldn't have told you, but I can't
  seem to trick you, Jean. You're the kind of a girl a fellow's got to play
  fair with."</p>

  <p>"Bobby has told me five times already to remember and keep my face away
  from the camera," Jean pointed out the second time. "Makes me feel as if I
  had lost my nose, or was cross-eyed or something. I do feel as if I'd lose my
  job, Gil."</p>

  <p>"No, you wouldn't; all he'd do would be to have a re-take of the whole
  scene, and maybe step around like a turkey in the snow, and swear to himself.
  Anyway, you can forget what I've said, if you'll feel more comfortable. It's
  up to Pete and me, and we'll put it over smooth, or we won't do it at all.
  Bobby won't realize it's happened till he hears from it afterwards. Neither
  will you." He turned his grease-painted face toward her hearteningly and
  smiled as endearingly as the sinister, painted lines would allow.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" he repeated as a final encouragement, because he had sensed her
  preoccupation and had misread it for worry over the picture. "You go ahead
  and shoot, and don't bother about me. Make it real. Shoot as close as you
  like. If you pink me a little I won't care,&mdash;if you'll promise to be my
  nurse. I want a vacation, anyway."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">XIV. &mdash; PUNCH VERSUS PRESTIGE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT seems to be a popular belief among those who are
  unfamiliar with the business of making motion pictures that all dangerous or
  difficult feats are merely tricks of the camera, and that the actors
  themselves take no risks whatever. The truth is that they take a good many
  more risks than the camera ever records; and that directors who worship what
  they call "punch" in their scenes are frequently as tender of the physical
  safety of their actors as was Napoleon or any other great warrior who
  measured results rather than wounds.</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns had discovered that he had at least two persons in his
  company who were perfectly willing to do anything he asked them to do. He had
  set tasks before Jean Douglas that many a man would have refused without
  losing his self-respect, and Jean had performed those tasks with enthusiasm.
  She had let herself down over a nasty bit of the rim-rock whose broken line
  extended half around the coulee bluff, with only her rope between herself and
  broken bones, and with her blond wig properly tousled and her face turned
  always towards the rock wall, lest the camera should reveal the fact that she
  was not Muriel Gay. She had climbed that same rock-rim, with the aid of that
  same rope, and with her face hidden as usual from the camera. She had been
  bound and gagged and flung across Gil Huntley's saddle and carried away at a
  sharp gallop, and she had afterwards freed herself from her bonds in the
  semi-darkness of a hut that half concealed her features, and had stolen the
  knife from Gil Huntley's belt while he slept, and crept away to where the
  horses were picketed. In the revealing light of a very fine moon-effect,
  which was a triumph of Pete's skill, she slashed a rope that held a
  high-strung "mustang" (so called in the scenario), and had leaped upon his
  bare back and gone hurtling out of that scene and into another, where she was
  riding furiously over dangerously rough ground, the whole outlaw band in
  pursuit and silhouetted against the skyline and the moon (which was another
  photographic triumph of Pete Lowry).</p>

  <p>Gil Huntley had also done many things that were risky. Jean had shot at
  him with real bullets so many times that her nervousness on this particular
  day was rather unaccountable to him. Jean had lassoed him and dragged him
  behind Pard through brush. She had pulled him from a quicksand
  bed,&mdash;made of cement that showed a strong tendency to "set" about his
  form before she could rescue him,&mdash;and she had fought with him on the
  edge of a cliff and had thrown him over; and his director, anxious for the
  "punch" that was his fetish, had insisted on a panorama of the fall, so that
  there was no chance for Gil to save himself the bruises he got. Gil Huntley's
  part it was always to die a violent death, or to be captured spectacularly,
  because he was the villain whose horrible example must bear a moral to
  youthful brains.</p>

  <p>Since Jean had become one of the company, he nearly always died at her
  hands or was captured by her. This left Muriel Gay unruffled and unhurt, so
  that she could weep and accept the love of Lee Milligan in the artistic
  ending of which Robert Grant Burns was so fond.</p>

  <p>Jean had never before considered it necessary to warn Gil and implore him
  not to be nervous, and Gil took her solicitude as an encouraging sign and was
  visibly cheered thereby. He knew little of guns and fine marksmanship, and he
  did not know that it is extremely difficult to shoot a revolver accurately
  and instantaneously; whereas Jean knew very well that Gil Huntley might be
  thrown off ledges every day in the week without taking the risk he would take
  that day.</p>

  <p>The scene was to close a full reel of desperate attempts upon the part of
  Gil Huntley to win Muriel; such desperate attempts, indeed, that Muriel Gay
  spent most of the time sitting at ease in the shade, talking with Lee
  Milligan, who was two thirds in love with her and had half his love returned,
  while Jean played her part for her. Sometimes Muriel would be called upon to
  assume the exact pose which Jean had assumed in a previous scene, for
  "close-up" that would reveal to audiences Muriel's well-known prettiness and
  help to carry along the deception. Each morning the two stood side by side
  and were carefully inspected by Robert Grant Burns, to make sure that hair
  and costumes were exactly alike in the smallest detail. This also helped to
  carry on the deception&mdash;to those who were not aware of Muriel's
  limitations. Their faces were not at all alike; and that is why Jean's face
  must never be seen in a picture.</p>

  <p>This shooting scene was a fitting climax to a long and desperate chase
  over a difficult trail; so difficult that Pard stumbled and
  fell,&mdash;supposedly with a broken leg,&mdash;and Jean must run on and on
  afoot, and climb over rocks and spring across dangerous crevices. She was not
  supposed to know where her flight was taking her. Sometimes the camera caught
  her silhouetted against the sky (Burns was partial to skyline silhouettes),
  and sometimes it showed her quite close,&mdash;in which case it would be
  Muriel instead of Jean,&mdash;clinging desperately to the face of a ledge
  (ledges were also favorite scenes), and seeking with hands or feet for a hold
  upon the rough face of the rock. During the last two or three scenes Gil
  Huntley had been shown gaining upon her.</p>

  <p>So they came to the location where the shooting scene was to be made that
  morning. Burns, with the camera and Pete and Muriel and her mother and Lee
  Milligan, drove to the place in the machine. Jean and Gil Huntley found them
  comfortably disposed in the shade, out of range of the camera which Pete was
  setting up somewhat closer than usual, under the direction of Burns.</p>

  <p>"There won't be any rehearsal of this," Burns stated at last, stepping
  back. "When it's done, if you don't bungle the scene, it'll be done. You
  stand here, Jean, and kind of lean against the rock as if you're all in from
  that chase. You hear Gil coming, and you start forward and listen, and
  look,&mdash;how far can she turn, Pete; without showing too much of her
  face?"</p>

  <p>Pete squinted into the finder and gave the information.</p>

  <p>"Well, Gil, you come from behind that bush. She'll be looking toward you
  then without turning too much. You grin, and come up with that eager,
  I-got-you-now look. Don't hurry too much; we'll give this scene plenty of
  time. This is the feature scene. Jean, you're at the end of your rope. You
  couldn't run another step if you wanted to, and you're cornered anyway, so
  you can't get away; get me? You're scared. Did you ever get scared in your
  life?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Jean simply, remembering last night when she had pulled the
  blanket over her head.</p>

  <p>"Well, you think of that time you were scared. And you make yourself think
  that you're going to shoot the thing that scared you. You don't put in half
  the punch when you shoot blanks; I've noticed that all along. So that's why
  you shoot a bullet. See? And you come as close to Gil as you can and not hit
  him. Gil, when you're shot, you go down all in a heap; you know what I mean.
  And Jean, when he falls, you start and lean forward, looking at
  him,&mdash;remember and keep your face away from the camera!&mdash;and then
  you start toward him kind of horrified. The scene stops right there, just as
  you start towards him. Then Gay takes it up and does the remorse and horror
  stuff because she's killed a man. That will be a close-up.</p>

  <p>"All right, now; take your places. Sure your gun is loose so you can pull
  it quick? That's the feature of this scene, remember. You want to get it
  across BIG! And make it real,&mdash;the scare, and all that. Hey, you women
  get behind the camera! Bullets glance, sometimes, and play the very
  mischief." He looked all around to make sure that everything was as it should
  be, faced Jean again, and raised his hand.</p>

  <p>"All ready? Start your action! Camera!"</p>

  <p>Jean had never before been given so much dramatic work to do, and Burns
  watched her anxiously, wishing that he dared cut the scene in two and give
  Muriel that tense interval when Gil Huntley came creeping into the scene from
  behind the bush. But after the first few seconds his strained expression
  relaxed; anxiety gave place to something like surprise.</p>

  <p>Jean stood leaning heavily against the rock, panting from the flight of
  the day before,&mdash;for so must emotion be carried over into the next day
  when photo- players work at their profession. Her face was dropped upon her
  arms flung up against the rock in an attitude of complete exhaustion and
  despair. Burns involuntarily nodded his head approvingly; the girl had the
  idea, all right, even if she never had been trained to act a part.</p>

  <p>"Come into the scene, Gil!" he commanded, when Jean made a move as though
  she was tempted to drop down upon the ground and sob hysterically. "Jean,
  register that you hear him coming."</p>

  <p>Jean's head came up and she listened, every muscle stiffening with fear.
  She turned her face toward Gil, who stopped and looked at her most
  villainously. Gil, you must know, had come from "legitimate" and was a clever
  actor. Jean recoiled a little before the leering face of him; pressed her
  shoulder hard against the ledge that had trapped her, and watched him in an
  agony of fear. One felt that she did, though one could not see her face. Gil
  spoke a few words and came on with a certain tigerish assurance of his power,
  but Jean did not move a muscle. She had backed as far away from him as she
  could get. She was not the kind to weep and plead with him. She just waited;
  and one felt that she was keyed up to the supreme moment of her life.</p>

  <p>Gil came closer and closer, and there was a look in his eyes that almost
  frightened Jean, accustomed as she had become to his acting a part; there was
  an intensity of purpose which she instinctively felt was real. She did not
  know what it was he had in mind, but whatever it was, she knew what it meant.
  He was almost within reach, so close that one saw Jean shrink a little from
  his nearness. He stopped and gathered himself for a quick, forward
  lunge&mdash;</p>

  <p>The two women screamed, though they had been expecting that swift drawing
  of Jean's gun and the shot that seemed to sound the instant her hand dropped.
  Gil stiffened, and his hand flew up to his temple. His eyes became two
  staring questions that bored into the soul of Jean. His hand dropped to his
  side, and his head sagged forward. He lurched, tried to steady himself and
  then went down limply.</p>

  <p>Jean dropped her gun and darted toward him, her face like chalk, as she
  turned it for one horrified instant toward Burns. She went down on her knees
  and lifted Gil's head, looking at the red blotch on his temple and the
  trickle that ran down his cheek. She laid his head down with a gentleness
  wholly unconscious, and looked again at Burns. "I've killed him," she said in
  a small, dry, flat voice. She put out her hands gropingly and fell forward
  across Gil's inert body. It was the first time in her life that Jean had ever
  fainted.</p>

  <p>"Stop the camera!" Burns croaked tardily, and Pete stopped turning. Pete
  had that little, twisted grin on his face, and he was perfectly calm and
  self-possessed.</p>

  <p>"You sure got the punch that time, Burns," he remarked unfeelingly, while
  he held his palm over the lens and gave the crank another turn or two to
  divide that scene from the next.</p>

  <p>"She's fainted! She's hit him!" cried Burns, and waddled over to where the
  two of them lay. The two women drew farther away, clinging to each other with
  excited exclamations.</p>

  <p>And then Gil Huntley lifted himself carefully so as not to push Jean upon
  the ground, and when he was sitting up, he took her in his arms with some
  remorse and a good deal of tenderness.</p>

  <p>"How was that for a punch?" he inquired of his director. "I didn't tell
  her I was going to furnish the blood-sponge; I thought it might rattle her. I
  never thought she'd take it so hard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns stopped and looked at him in heavy silence. "Good
  Lord!" he snapped out at last. "I dunno whether to fire you off the
  job&mdash;or raise your salary! You got the punch, all right. And the chances
  are you've ruined her nerve for shooting, into the bargain." He stood looking
  down perturbedly at Gil, who was smoothing Jean's hair back from her forehead
  after the manner of men who feel tenderly toward the woman who cries or
  faints in their presence. "I'm after the punch every time," Burns went on
  ruefully, "but there's no use being a hog about it. Where's that water-bag,
  Lee? Go get it out of the machine. Say! Can't you women do something besides
  stand there and howl? Nobody's hurt, or going to be."</p>

  <p>While Muriel and Gil Huntley did what they could to bring Jean back to
  consciousness and composure, Robert Grant Burns paced up and down and debated
  within himself a subject which might have been called "punch versus
  prestige." Should he let that scene stand, or should he order a "re-take"
  because Jean had, after all, done the dramatic part, the "remorse stuff"? Of
  course, when Pete sent the film in, the trimmers could cut the scene; they
  probably would cut the scene just where Gil went down in a decidedly
  realistic heap. But it hurt the professional soul of Robert Grant Burns to
  retake a scene so compellingly dramatic, because it had been so absolutely
  real.</p>

  <p>Jean was sitting up with her back against the ledge looking rather pale
  and feeling exceedingly foolish, while Gil Huntley explained to her about the
  "blood-sponge" and how he had held it concealed in his hand until the right
  moment, and had used it in the interest of realism and not to frighten her,
  as she might have reason to suspect. Gil Huntley was showing a marked
  tendency to repeat himself. He had three times assured her earnestly that he
  did not mean to scare her so, when the voice of the chief reminded him that
  this was merely an episode in the day's work. He jumped up and gave his
  attention to Burns.</p>

  <p>"Gil, take that same position you had when you fell. Put a little more
  blood on your face; you wiped most of it off. That right leg is sprawled out
  too far. Draw it up a little. Throw out your left arm a little more.
  Whoa&mdash; Enough is plenty. Now, Gay, you take Jean's gun and hold it down
  by your side, where her hand dropped right after she fired. You stand right
  about here, where her tracks are. Get INTO her tracks! We're picking up the
  scene right where Gil fell. She looked straight into the camera and spoiled
  the rest, or I'd let it go in. Some acting, if you ask me, seeing it wasn't
  acting at all." He sent one of his slant-eyed glances toward Jean, who bit
  her lips and looked away.</p>

  <p>"Lean forward a little, and hold that gun like you knew what it was made
  for, anyway!" He regarded Muriel glumly. "Say! that ain't a stick of candy
  you're trying to hide in your skirt," he pointed out, with an exasperated,
  rising inflection at the end of the sentence. "John Jimpson! If I could take
  you two girls to pieces and make one out of the two of you, I'd have an
  actress that could play Western leads, maybe!</p>

  <p>"Oh, well&mdash;thunder! All you can do is put over the action so they'll
  forget the gun. Say, you drop it the second the camera starts. You pick up
  the action where Jean dropped the gun and started for Gil. See if you can put
  it over the way she did. She really thought she'd killed him, remember. You
  saw the real, honest-to-John, horror-dope that time. Now see how close you
  can copy it.</p>

  <p>"All ready? START your ACTION!" he barked. "Camera!"</p>

  <p>Brutally absorbed in his work he might be; callous to the tragedy in
  Jean's eyes at what might have happened; unfeeling in his greedy seizure of
  her horror as good "stuff" for Muriel Gay to mimic. Yet the man's energy was
  dynamic; his callousness was born of his passion for the making of good
  pictures. He swept even Jean out of the emotional whirlpool and into the
  calm, steady current of the work they had to do.</p>

  <p>He instructed Pete to count as spoiled those fifteen feet of film which
  recorded Jean's swift horror. But Pete Lowry did not always follow slavishly
  his instructions. He sent the film in as it was, without comment. Then he and
  Gil Huntley counted on their fingers the number of days that would probably
  elapse before they might hope to hear the result, and exchanged knowing
  glances now and then when Robert Grant Burns seemed especially careful that
  Jean's face should not be seen by the recording eye of the camera. And they
  waited; and after awhile they began to show a marked interest in the mail
  from the west.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">XV. &mdash; A LEADING LADY THEY WOULD MAKE OF JEAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SOMETIMES events follow docilely the plans that would lead
  them out of the future of possibilities and into the present of actualities,
  and sometimes they bring with them other events which no man may foresee
  unless he is indeed a prophet. You would never think, for instance, that Gil
  Huntley and his blood sponge would pull from the future a chain of incidents
  that would eventually&mdash;well, never mind what. Just follow the chain of
  incidents and see what lies at the end.</p>

  <p>Pete Lowry and Gil had planned cunningly for a certain readjustment of
  Jean's standing in the company, for no deeper reasons than their genuine
  liking for the girl and a common human impulse to have a hand in the ordering
  of their little world. In ten days Robert Grant Burns received a letter from
  Dewitt, president of the Great Western Film Company, which amply fulfilled
  those plans, and, as I said, opened the way for other events quite
  unforeseen.</p>

  <p>There were certain orders from the higher-ups which Robert Grant Burns
  must heed. They were, briefly, the immediate transfer of Muriel Gay to the
  position of leading woman in a new company which was being sent to Santa
  Barbara to make light comedy-dramas. Robert Grant Burns grunted when he read
  that, though it was a step up the ladder for Muriel which she would be glad
  to take. The next paragraph instructed him to place the young woman who had
  been doubling for Miss Gay in the position which Miss Gay would leave vacant.
  It was politely suggested that he adapt the leading woman's parts to the
  ability of this young woman; which meant that he must write his scenarios
  especially with her in mind. He was informed that he should feature the young
  woman in her remarkable horsemanship, etc. It was pointed out that her work
  was being noticed in the Western features which Robert Grant Burns had been
  sending in, and that other film companies would no doubt make overtures
  shortly, in the hope of securing her services. Under separate cover they were
  mailing a contract which would effectually forestall such overtures, and they
  were relying upon him to see that she signed up with the Great Western as per
  contract. Finally, it was suggested, since Mr. Dewitt chose always to suggest
  rather than to command, that Robert Grant Burns consider the matter of
  writing a series of short stories having some connecting thread of plot and
  featuring this Miss Douglas. (This, by the way, was the beginning of the
  serial form of motion- picture plays which has since become so popular.)</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns read that letter through slowly, and then sat down
  heavily in an old arm-chair in the hotel office, lighted one of his favorite
  fat, black cigars, and mouthed it absently, while he read the letter through
  again. He said "John Jimpson!" just above a whisper. He held the letter in
  his two hands and regarded it strangely. Then he looked up, caught the
  quizzical, inquiring glance of Pete Lowry, and beckoned that secret-smiling
  individual over to him. "Read that!" he grunted. "Read it and tell me what
  you think of it."</p>

  <p>Pete Lowry read it carefully, and grinned when he handed it back. He did
  not, however, tell Robert Grant Burns just exactly what he thought of it. He
  merely said that it had to come sometime, he guessed.</p>

  <p>"She can't put over the dramatic stuff," objected Robert Grant Burns.
  "She's got the face for it, all right, and when she registers real emotions,
  it gets over big. The bottled-up kind of people always do. But she's never
  acted an emotion she didn't feel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How about that all-in stuff, and the listening-and&mdash; waiting
  business she put across before she took a shot at Gil that time she fainted?"
  Pete reminded him. "If you ask me, that little girl can act."</p>

  <p>"Well, whether she can or not, she's got to try it," said Burns with some
  foreboding. "She's been going big, with Gay to do all the close-up, dramatic
  work. The trouble is, Pete, that girl always does as she darn pleases! If I
  put her opposite Lee in a scene and tell her to act like she is in love with
  him, and that he's to kiss her and she's to kiss back,&mdash;" he flung out
  his hands expressively. "You must know the rest, as well as I do. She'd turn
  around and give me a call-down, and get on her horse and ride off; and I and
  my picture could go to thunder, for all of her. That's the point; she ain't
  been through the mill. She don't know anything about taking orders&mdash;from
  me or anybody else." It is a pity that Lite did not hear that! He might have
  amended the statement a little. Jean had been taking orders enough; she knew
  a great deal about receiving ultimatums. The trouble was that she seldom paid
  any attention to them. Lite was accustomed to that, but Robert Grant Burns
  was not, and it irked him sore.</p>

  <p>"Well, she's sure got the screen personality," Pete defended. "I've said
  it all along. That girl don't have to act. Put her in the part, and she is
  the part! She's got something better than technique, Burns. She's got
  imagination. She puts herself in a character and lives it."</p>

  <p>"Put her on a horse and she does," Burns conceded gloomily. "But will you
  tell me what kind of work she'll make of interior scenes, and love scenes,
  and all that? You've got to have it, to pad out your story. You can't let
  your leading character do a whole two&mdash; or three-reel picture on
  horseback. There wouldn't be any contrast. Dewitt don't know that girl the
  way I do. If he'd had to side-step and scheme and give in the way I've done
  to keep her working, he wouldn't put her playing straight leads, not until
  she'd had a year or two of training&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Taming is a better word," Pete suggested drily. "There'll be fun when she
  gets to playing love scenes opposite Lee. You better let him take the
  heavies, and put Gil in for leads, Burns."</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns was so cast down by the prospect that he made no
  attempt to reply, beyond grunting something about preferring to drive a team
  of balky mules to making Jean do something she did not want to do. But, such
  is the mind trained to a profession, insensibly he drifted away into the
  world of his imagination, and began to draw therefrom the first tenuous
  threads of a plot wherein Jean's peculiar accomplishments were to be
  featured. Robert Grant Burns had long ago learned to adjust himself to
  circumstances which in themselves were not to his liking. He adjusted himself
  now to the idea of making Jean the Western star his employers seemed to think
  was inevitable.</p>

  <p>That night before he went to bed he wrote a play which had in it fifty-two
  scenes. Thirty-five of them were what is known technically as exteriors. In
  most of them Jean was to ride on horseback through wild places. The rest were
  dramatic close-ups. Robert Grant Burns went over it carefully when it was
  finished, and groaning inwardly he cut out two love scenes which were tense,
  and which Muriel Gay and Lee Milligan would have "eaten up," as he mentally
  expressed it. The love interest, he realized bitterly, must be touched upon
  lightly in his scenarios from now on; which would have lightened appreciably
  the heart of Lite Avery, if he had only known it, and would have erased from
  his mind a good many depressing visions of Jean as the film sweetheart of
  those movie men whom he secretly hated.</p>

  <p>Jean did not hesitate five minutes before she signed the contract which
  Burns presented to her the next morning. She was human, and she had learned
  enough about the business to see that, speaking from a purely professional
  point of view, she was extremely fortunate. Not every girl, surely, can hope
  to jump in a few weeks from the lowly position of an inexperienced "extra" to
  the supposedly exalted one of leading woman. And to her that hundred dollars
  a week which the contract insured her looked a fortune. It spelled home to
  her, and the vindication of her beloved dad, of whom she dared not think
  sometimes, it hurt her so.</p>

  <p>Her book was not progressing as fast as she had expected when she began
  it. She had been working at it sporadically now for eight weeks, and she had
  only ten chapters done,&mdash;and some of these were terribly short. She had
  looked through all of the novels that she owned, and had computed the average
  number of chapters in each; thirty she decided would be a good, conservative
  number to write. She had even divided those thirty into three parts, and had
  impartially allotted ten to adventure, ten to mystery and horror, and ten to
  love- making. Such an arrangement should please everybody, surely, and need
  only be worked out smoothly to prove most satisfying.</p>

  <p>But, as it happened, comedy would creep into the mystery and horror, which
  she mentally lumped together as agony. Adventure ran riot, and straight love-
  making chapters made her sleepy, they bored her so. She had tried one or two,
  and she had found it impossible to concentrate her mind upon them. Instead,
  she had sat and planned what she would do with the money that was steadily
  accumulating in the bank; a pitiful little sum, to be sure, to those who
  count by the thou- sands, but cheering enough to Jean, who had never before
  had any money of her own.</p>

  <p>So she signed the contract and worked that day so light-heartedly that
  Robert Grant Burns forgot his pessimism. When the light began to fade and
  grow yellow, and the big automobile went purring down the trail to town, she
  rode on to the Bar Nothing to find Lite, and tell him how fortune had come
  and tapped her on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>She did not see Lite anywhere about the ranch, and so she did not put her
  hopes and her plans and her good fortune into speech. She did see her Aunt
  Ella, who straightway informed her that people were talking about the way she
  rode here and there with those painted-up people, and let the men put their
  arms around her and make love to her. Her Aunt Ella made it perfectly plain
  to Jean that she, for one, did not consider it respectable. Her Aunt Ella
  said that Carl was going to do something about it, if things weren't changed
  pretty quick.</p>

  <p>Jean did not appear to regard her aunt's disapproval as of any importance
  whatever, but the words stung. She had herself worried a little over the
  love-making scenes which she knew she would now be called upon to play. Jean,
  you will have observed, was not given to sentimental adventurings; and she
  disliked the idea of letting Lee Milligan make love to her the way he had
  made love to Muriel Gay through picture after picture. She would do it, she
  supposed, if she had to; she wanted the salary. But she would hate it
  intolerably. She made reply with sarcasm which she knew would particularly
  irritate her Aunt Ella, and left the house feeling that she never wanted to
  enter it again as long as she lived.</p>

  <p>The sight of her uncle standing beside Pard in an attitude of disgusted
  appraisement of the new Navajo blanket and the silver-trimmed bridle and
  tapideros which Burns had persuaded her to add to her riding
  outfit,&mdash;for photographic effect,&mdash;brought a hot flush of
  resentment. She went up quietly enough, however. Indeed, she went up so
  quietly that he started when she appeared almost beside him and picked up
  Pard's reins, and took the stirrup to mount and ride away. She did not speak
  to him at all; she had not spoken to him since that night when the little
  brown bird had died! Though perhaps that was because she had managed to keep
  out of his way.</p>

  <p>"I see you've been staking yourself to a new bridle," Carl began in a tone
  quite as sour as his look. "You must have bought out all the tin decorations
  they had in stock, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>Jean swung up into the saddle before she looked at him. "If I did, it's my
  own affair," she retorted. "I paid for the tin decorations with my own
  money."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you did! Well, you might have been in better business than paying for
  that kind of thing. You might," he sneered up at her, "have been paying for
  your keep these last three years, if you've got more money of your own than
  you know what to do with."</p>

  <p>Jean could not ride off under the sting of that gratuitous insult. She
  held Pard quiet and looked down at him with hate in her eyes. "I expect," she
  said in a queer, quiet wrath, "to prove before long that my own money has
  been paying for my `keep' these last three years; for that and for other
  things that did not benefit me in the least."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to know what you mean by that!" Carl caught Pard by the
  bridle-rein and looked up at her in a white fury that startled even Jean,
  accustomed as she was to his sudden rages that contrasted with his sullen
  attitude toward the world.</p>

  <p>"What do you think I would mean? Let go my bridle. I don't want to quarrel
  with you."</p>

  <p>"What did you mean by proving&mdash;what do you expect to prove?" His hand
  was heavy on the rein, so that Pard began to fret under the restraint.
  "You've got to quit running around all over the country with them show folks,
  and stay at home and behave yourself. You've got to quit hanging out at the
  Lazy A. I've stood as much as I'm going to stand of your performances. You
  get down off that horse and go into the house and behave yourself; that's
  what you'll do! If you haven't got any shame or decency&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jean scarcely knew what she did, just then. She must have dug Pard with
  her spurs, because the first thing that she realized was the lunge he gave.
  Carl's hold slipped from the rein, as he was jerked sidewise. He made an
  ineffective grab at Jean's skirt, and he called her a name she had never
  heard spoken before in her life. A rod or so away she pulled up and turned to
  face him, but the words she would have spoken stuck in her throat. She had
  never seen Carl Douglas look like that; she had seen him when he was furious,
  she had seen him when he sulked, but she had never seen him look like
  that.</p>

  <p>He called her to come back. He made threats of what he would do if she
  refused to obey him. He shook his fist at her. He behaved like a man
  temporarily robbed of his reason; his eyes, as he came up glaring at her,
  were the eyes of a madman.</p>

  <p>Jean felt a tremor of dread while she looked at him and listened to him.
  He was almost within reach of her again when she wheeled and went off up the
  trail at a run. She looked back often, half fearing that he would get a horse
  and follow her, but he stood just where she had left him, and he seemed to be
  still uttering threats and groundless accusations as long as she was in
  sight.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">XVI. &mdash; FOR ONCE AT LEAST LITE HAD HIS WAY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HALF a mile she galloped, and met Lite coming home. She
  glanced over her shoulder before she pulled Pard down to a walk, and Lite's
  greeting, as he turned and rode alongside her, was a question. He wanted to
  know what was the matter with her. He listened with his old manner of
  repression while she told him, and he made no comment whatever until she had
  finished.</p>

  <p>"You must have made him pretty sore," he said dispassionately. "I don't
  think myself that you ought to stay over to the ranch alone. Why don't you do
  as he says?"</p>

  <p>"And go back to the Bar Nothing?" Jean shivered a little. "Nothing could
  make me go back there! Lite, you don't understand. He acted like a crazy man;
  and I hadn't said anything to stir him up like that. He was&mdash;Lite, he
  scared me! I couldn't stay on the ranch with him. I couldn't be in the same
  room with him."</p>

  <p>"You can't go on staying at the Lazy A," Lite told her flatly.</p>

  <p>"There's no other place where I'd stay."</p>

  <p>"You could," Lite pointed out, "stay in town and go back and forth with
  the rest of the bunch. It would be a lot better, any way you look at it."</p>

  <p>"It would be a lot worse. There's my book; I wouldn't have any chance to
  write on that. And there's the expense. I'm saving every nickel I possibly
  can, Lite, and you know what for. And there's the bunch&mdash;I see enough of
  them during working hours. I'd go crazy if I had to live with them. Lite,
  they've put me in playing leads! I'm to get a hundred dollars a week! Just
  think of that! And Burns says that I'll have to go back to Los Angeles with
  them when they go this fall, because the contract I signed lasts for a
  year."</p>

  <p>She sighed. "I rode over to tell you about it. It seemed to be good news,
  when I left home. But now, it's just a part of the black tangle that life's
  made up of. Aunt Ella started things off by telling me what a disgrace it is
  for me to work in these pictures. And Uncle Carl&mdash;" She shivered in
  spite of herself. "I just can't understand Uncle Carl's going into such a
  rage. It was&mdash;awful."</p>

  <p>Lite rode for some distance before he lifted his head or spoke. Then he
  looked at Jean, who was staring straight ahead and seeing nothing save what
  her thoughts pictured.</p>

  <p>He did not say a word about her going to Los Angeles.</p>

  <p>He was the bottled-up type; the things that hit him hardest he seldom
  mentioned, so by that rule it might be inferred that her going hit hard. But
  his voice was normally calm, and his tone was the tone of authority, which
  Jean knew very well, and which nearly always amused her because she firmly
  believed it to be utterly useless.</p>

  <p>He said in the tone of an ultimatum: "If you're bound to stay at the
  ranch, you've got to have somebody with you. I'll ride in and get Hepsy
  Atwood in the morning. You're getting thin. I don't believe you take time to
  cook enough to eat. You can't work on soda crackers and sardines. The old
  lady won't charge much to come and stay with you. I'll come over after I'm
  through work to-morrow and help her get things looking a little more like
  living."</p>

  <p>"You'll do nothing of the sort." Jean looked at him mutinously. "I'm all
  right just as I am. I won't have her, Lite. That's settled."</p>

  <p>"Sure, it's settled," Lite agreed, with more than his usual pertinacity.
  "I'll have her out here by noon, and a supply of real grub. How are you fixed
  for bedding?"</p>

  <p>"I won't have her, I tell you. You're always trying to make me do things I
  won't do. Don't be silly."</p>

  <p>"Sure not." Lite shifted in the saddle with the air of a man who rides at
  perfect ease with himself and with the world. "She'll likely have plenty of
  bedding of her own," he meditated, after a brief silence.</p>

  <p>"Lite, if you haul Hepsibah out here, I'll send her back!"</p>

  <p>"I'll haul her out," said Lite in a tone of finality, "but you won't send
  her back." He paused. "She ain't much protection, maybe," he remarked
  somewhat enigmatically, "but it'll beat staying alone nights. You&mdash;you
  can't tell who might come prowling around the place."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? Do you know about&mdash;" Jean caught herself on the
  verge of betrayal.</p>

  <p>"You want to keep your gun handy. Just on general principles," Lite
  remonstrated. "You can't tell; it's away off from everywhere."</p>

  <p>"I won't have Hepsy Atwood. Haven't I enough to drive me mad, without
  her?"</p>

  <p>"Is there anybody else that you'd rather have?" Lite looked at her
  speculatively.</p>

  <p>"No, there isn't. I won't have anybody. It would be a nuisance having some
  old lady in the house gabbling and gossiping. I'm not the least bit afraid,
  except,&mdash; I'm not afraid, and I like to be alone. I won't have her,
  Lite."</p>

  <p>Lite said no more about it until they reached the house, huddled
  lonesomely against the barren bluff, its windows staring black into the dusk.
  Jean did not seem to expect Lite to dismount, but he did not wait to see what
  she expected him to do. In his most matter- of-fact manner he dismounted and
  turned his horse, still saddled, into the stable with Pard. He preceded Jean
  up the path, and went into the kitchen ahead of her; lighted a match and
  found the lamp, and set its flame to brightening the dingy room.</p>

  <p>Jean had not done much in the way of making that part of the house more
  attractive. She used the kitchen to cook in, because the stove was there, and
  the dishes. She had spread an old braided rug over the brown stain on the
  floor, and she ate in her own room with the door shut.</p>

  <p>Without being told, Lite seemed to know all about her secret aversion to
  the kitchen. He took up the lamp and went now on a tour of inspection through
  the house. Jean followed him, wondering a little, and thinking that this was
  the way that mysterious stranger came and prowled at night, except that he
  must have used matches to light the way, or a candle, since the lamp seemed
  never to be disturbed. Lite went into all the rooms and held the lamp so that
  its brightness searched out all the corners. He looked into the small, stuffy
  closets. He stood in the middle of her father's room and seemed to meditate
  deeply, while Jean stood in the doorway and watched him inquiringly. He came
  back finally to the kitchen and looked into the cupboard, as though he was
  taking an inventory of her supply of provisions.</p>

  <p>"You might cook me some supper, Jean," he said, when he had put the lamp
  on the table. "I see you've got eggs and bacon. I'm pretty hungry,&mdash;for
  a man that had his dinner six or seven hours ago."</p>

  <p>Jean cooked supper, and they ate together in the kitchen. It did not seem
  so gruesome with Lite there, and she told him some funny things that had
  happened in her work, and mimicked Robert Grant Burns with an accuracy of
  manner and tone that would have astonished that pompous person a good deal
  and flattered him not at all. She almost recovered her spirits under the
  stimulus of Lite's presence, and she quite forgot that he had threatened her
  with Hepsibah Atwood.</p>

  <p>But when he had wiped the dishes and had taken up his hat to go, Lite
  proved how tenaciously his mind could hold to an idea, and how even Jean
  could not quite match him for stubbornness.</p>

  <p>"That mattress in the little bedroom looks all right," he said. "I'll pack
  it outside before I go, so it will have all day to-morrow out in the sun.
  I'll have Hepsy bring her own bedding. Well&mdash;so long."</p>

  <p>Jean would have sworn in perfect good faith that Lite led his horse out of
  the stable, mounted it, and rode away to the Bar Nothing. He did mount and
  ride away as far as the mouth of the coulee. But that night he spent in the
  loft over the shop, and he did not sleep five minutes during the night. Most
  of the time he spent leaning against his rolled bedding, smoking and gazing
  at the silent house where Jean slept. You may interpret that as you will.</p>

  <p>Jean did not see or hear anything more of him, until about four o'clock
  the next afternoon, when he drove calmly up to the house and deposited
  Hepsibah Atwood upon the kitchen steps. He did not wait for Jean to order
  them away. He hurried the unloading, released the wagon brake, and drove off.
  So Jean, coming from the spring behind the house, really got her first sight
  of him as he went rattling down to the gate.</p>

  <p>Jean stood and looked after him, twitched her shoulders in a mental
  yielding of the point for the time being, and said "How-da-do" to the old
  lady.</p>

  <p>She was not so old, as years go; fifty-five or thereabouts. And she could
  have whispered into Lite's ear without standing on her toes or asking him to
  bend his head. Lite was a tall man, at that. She had gray hair that was
  frizzy around her brows and at the back of her neck, and she had an Irish
  disposition without the brogue to go with it.</p>

  <p>The first thing she did was to find an axe and chop a lot of fence-posts
  into firewood, as easily as Lite himself could have done it, and in other
  ways proceeded to make herself very much at home. The next day she dipped the
  spring almost dry, and used up all the soap in the house; and for three days
  went around with her skirts tucked up and her arms bare and the soles of her
  shoes soggy from wet floors. Jean kept out of her way, but she owned to
  herself that, after all, it was not unpleasant to come home tired and not
  have to cook a solitary supper and eat it in silent meditation.</p>

  <p>The third night after Hepsy's arrival, Jean awoke to hear a man's furtive
  footsteps in her father's room. This was the fifth time that the prowler had
  come in the night, and custom had dulled her fear a little. She had not
  reached the point yet of getting up to see who it was and what he wanted. It
  was much easier to lie perfectly still with her six-shooter gripped in her
  hand and wait for him to go. Beyond stealthily trying her door and finding it
  fastened on the inside, he had never shown any disposition to invade her
  room</p>

  <p>To-night was as all other nights when he came and made that mysterious
  search, until he went into the little bedroom where slept Hepsibah Atwood.
  Jean listened to the faint creaking of old boards which told her that he was
  approaching Hepsy's room, and she wondered if Hepsy would hear him. Hepsy did
  hear him. There was a squeak of the old bedstead that told how a hundred and
  seventy-two pounds of indignant womanhood was rising to do battle.</p>

  <p>"Who's that? Git outa here, or I'll smash you!" There was no fear but a
  great deal of determination in Hepsy's voice, and there was the sound of her
  bare feet spatting on the floor.</p>

  <p>The man's footsteps retreated hurriedly. Jean heard the kitchen door open
  and slam shut with a shrill squeal of its rusty hinges, and the sound of a
  man running down the path. She heard Hepsy muttering threats while she
  followed to the door and looked out, and she heard the muttering continue
  while Hepsy returned to bed.</p>

  <p>It was very comforting. Jean tucked her gun under her pillow, laughed to
  herself for having shuddered under the blankets at the sound of a man so
  easily put to flight, and went to sleep feeling quite secure and for the
  first time really glad that Hepsibah Atwood was in the house.</p>

  <p>She listened the next morning to Hepsy's colorful account of the affair,
  but she did not tell Hepsy that the man had been there before. She did not
  even tell her that she had heard the disturbance, and was lying with her gun
  in her hand ready to shoot if he came into her room. For a girl as frank and
  outspoken as was Jean, she had almost as great a talent as Lite for holding
  her tongue.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">XVII. &mdash; "WHY DON'T YOU GIVE THEM SOMETHING REAL?"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WELL, you don't seem crazy about it. What's the matter?"
  Robert Grant Burns stood in his favorite attitude with his hands on his hips
  and his feet far apart, and looked down at Jean with a secret anxiety in his
  eyes. Without realizing it in the least, Jean's opinion had come to have a
  certain weight with Robert Grant Burns. "What's wrong with that?" Burns,
  having sat up until two o'clock to finish that particular scenario to his
  liking, plainly resented the expression on Jean's face while she read it.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing, only I'm getting awfully sick of these kidnap-and-rescue,
  and kiss-in-the-last-scene pictures, and Wild West stuff without a real
  Western man in the whole thing. I'd like to do something real for a
  change."</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns grunted and reached for his slighted brain-child. "What
  you want? Mother on, knitting. Girl washing dishes. Lover arrives; they sit
  on front steps and spoon. Become engaged. Lover hitches up team, girl climbs
  into wagon, they drive to town. Ten scenes of driving to town. Lover gets
  out, ties team in front of courthouse. Goes in and gets license. Three scenes
  of license business. Goes out. Two scenes of driving to minister and hitching
  team to gate. One scene of getting to door. One scene getting inside the
  house. One scene preacher calling his wife and hired girl. One scene `Do you
  take this woman,' one scene `I do.' Fifteen scenes getting team untied and
  driving back to ranch. That's about as much pep as there is in real life in
  the far West, these days. Something like that would suit you, maybe. It don't
  suit the people who pay good nickels and dimes to get a thrill, though."</p>

  <p>"Neither does this sort of junk, if they've got any sense. Think of paying
  nickel after nickel to see Lee Milligan rush to the girl's door, knock, learn
  the fatal news, stagger back and clap his hand to his brow and say `Great
  Heaven! GONE!'" Jean, stirred to combat by the sarcasm of Robert Grant Burns,
  did the stagger and the hand-to-brow and great-heaven scene with a realism
  that made Pete Lowry turn his back suddenly. "They've seen Gil abduct me or
  Muriel seven times in a perfectly impossible manner, and they&mdash;oh, why
  don't you give them something REAL? Things that are thrilling and dangerous
  and terrible do happen out here, Mr. Burns. Real adventures and real
  tragedies&mdash;" She stopped, and Burns turned his eyes involuntarily toward
  the kitchen. He had heard all about the history of the Lazy A, though he had
  been very careful to hide the fact that he had heard it. Jean's glance,
  following that of her director, was a revealing one. She bit her lip; and in
  a moment she went on, with her chin held a shade higher and her pride
  revolting against subterfuge.</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean that," she said quietly. "But&mdash; well, up to a certain
  point, I don't mind if you put in real things, if it will be good
  picture-stuff. You're featuring me, anyway, it seems. Listen." Jean's face
  changed. Her eyes took that farseeing look of the dreamer. She was looking
  full at Burns, but he knew that she did not see him at all. She was looking
  at a mental picture of her own conjuring, he judged. He stood still and
  waited curiously, wondering, to use his manner of speech, what the girl was
  going to spring now.</p>

  <p>"Listen: Instead of all this impossible piffle, let's start a real story.
  I&mdash;I've&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What kind of a real story?" The tone of Robert Grant Burns was carefully
  non-committal, but his eyes betrayed his eagerness. The girl did have some
  real ideas, sometimes! And Robert Grant Burns was not the one to refuse a
  real idea because it did not come from his own brain.</p>

  <p>"Well," Jean flushed with an adorable shyness at the apparent egotism of
  her idea, "since you seem to want me for the central figure in everything,
  suppose we start a story like this: Suppose I am left here at the Lazy A with
  my mother to take care of and a ranch and a lot of cattle; and suppose it's a
  hard proposition, because there's really a gang of rustlers that have been
  running off stock and never getting caught, and they have a grudge against my
  family and grab our cattle every chance they get. Suppose&mdash;suppose they
  killed my brother when he was about to round them up, and they want to drive
  me and my mother out of the country. Scare us out, you know. Well,&mdash;"
  she hesitated and glanced diffidently at the boys who had edged up to
  listen,&mdash;"that would leave room for all kinds of feature stuff. Say that
  I have just one or two boys that I can depend on, boys that I know are loyal.
  With an outfit the size of ours, that keeps me in the saddle every day and
  all day; and I would have some narrow escapes, I reckon. You've got your
  rustlers all made to order,&mdash;only I'd make them up differently, if I
  were doing it. Have them look real, you know, instead of stagey." (Whereat
  Robert Grant Burns winced.) "Lee could be one of my loyal cowboys; you'd want
  some dramatic acting, I reckon, and he could do that. But I'd want one
  puncher who can ride and shoot and handle a rope. For that, to help me do the
  real work in the picture, I want Lite Avery. There are things I can do that
  you have never had me do, for the simple reason that you don't know the life
  well enough ever to think of them. Real stunts, not these made-to-order,
  shoot-the-villain-and-run-to-the-arms-of-the-hero stuff. I'd have to have
  Lite Avery; I wouldn't start without him."</p>

  <p>"Well, go on." Robert Grant Burns still tried to sound non-committal, but
  he was plainly eager to hear all that she had to say.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's the idea. They're trying to drive us out of the country,
  without really hurting me. And I've got my mind set on staying. Not only
  that, but I believe they killed my brother, and I'm going to hunt them down
  and break up their gang or die in the attempt. There's your plot. It needn't
  be overdone in the least, to have thrills enough. And there would be all
  kinds of chance for real range-stuff, like the handling of cattle and all
  that.</p>

  <p>"We can use this ranch just as it is, and have the outlaws down next the
  river. I'm glad you haven't taken any scenes that show the ranch as a whole.
  You've stuck to your close-up, great-heaven scenes so much," she went on with
  merciless frankness, "that you've really not cheapened the place by showing
  more than a little bit at a time.</p>

  <p>"You might start by making Lee up for my brother, and kill him in the
  first reel; show the outlaws when they shoot him and run off with a bunch of
  stock they're after. Lite can find him and bring him home. Lite would know
  just how to do that sort of thing, and make people see it's real stuff. I
  believe he'd show he was a real cow-puncher, even to the people who never saw
  one. There's an awful lot of difference between the real thing and your
  actors." She was so perfectly sincere and so matter-of-fact that the men she
  criticised could do no more than grin.</p>

  <p>"You might, for the sake of complications, put a traitor and spy on the
  ranch. Oh, I tell you! Have Hepsibah be the mother of one of the outlaws. She
  wouldn't need to do any acting; you could show her sneaking out in the dark
  to meet her son and tell him what she has overheard. And show her listening,
  perhaps, through the crack in a door. Mrs. Gay would have to be the mother.
  Gil says that Hepsibah has the figure of a comedy cook and what he calls a
  character face. I believe we could manage her all right, for what little she
  would have to do, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Jean having poured out her inspiration with a fluency born of her first
  enthusiasm, began to feel that she had been somewhat presumptuous in thus
  offering advice wholesale to the highest paid director of the Great Western
  Film Company. She blushed and laughed a little, and shrugged her
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That's just a suggestion," she said with forced lightness. "I'm subject
  to attacks of acute imagination, sometimes. Don't mind me, Mr. Burns. Your
  scenario is a very nice scenario, I'm sure. Do you want me to be a
  braid-down-the-back girl in this? Or a curls-around-the-face girl?"</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns stood absent-mindedly tapping his left palm with the
  folded scenario which Jean had just damned by calling it a very nice
  scenario. Nice was not the adjective one would apply to it in sincere
  admiration. Robert Grant Burns himself had mentally called it a hummer. He
  did not reply to Jean's tentative apology for her own plot-idea. He was
  thinking about the idea itself.</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns was not what one would call petty. He would not, for
  instance, stick to his own story if he considered that Jean's was a better
  one. And, after all, Jean was now his leading woman, and it is not unusual
  for a leading woman to manufacture her own plots, especially when she is
  being featured by her company. There was no question of hurt pride to be
  debated within the mind of him, therefore. He was just weighing the idea
  itself for what it was worth.</p>

  <p>"Seems to me your plot-idea isn't so much tamer than mine, after all." He
  tested her shrewdly after a prolonged pause. "You've got a killing in the
  first five hundred feet, and outlaws and rustling&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, but don't you see, it isn't the skeleton that makes the difference;
  it's the kind of meat you put on the bones! Paradise Lost would be a howling
  melodrama, if some of you picture-people tried to make it. You'd take this
  plot of mine and make it just like these pictures I've been working in, Mr.
  Burns: Exciting and all that, but not the real West after all; spectacular
  without being probable. What I mean,&mdash;I can't explain it to you, I'm
  afraid; but I have it in my head." She looked at him with that lightening of
  the eyes which was not a smile, really, but rather the amusement which might
  grow into laughter later on.</p>

  <p>"You'd better fine me for insubordination," she drawled whimsically, "and
  tell me whether it's to be braids or curls, so I can go and make up." At that
  moment she saw Gil Huntley beckoning to her with a frantic kind of
  furtiveness that was a fair mixture of pinched-together eyebrows and slight
  jerkings of the head, and a guarded movement of his hand that hung at his
  side. Gil, she thought, was trying to draw her away before she went too far
  with her trouble-inviting freedom of speech. She laughed lazily.</p>

  <p>"Braids or curls?" she insisted. "And please, sir, I won't do so no more,
  honest."</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns looked at her from under his eyebrows and made a sound
  between his grunt of indignation and his chuckle of amusement. "Sure you
  won't?" he queried shortly. "Stay the way you are, if you want to; chances
  are you won't go to work right away, anyhow."</p>

  <p>Jean flashed him a glance of inquiry. Did that mean that she had at last
  gone beyond the limit? Was Robert Grant Burns going to FIRE her? She looked
  at Gil, who was sauntering off with the perfectly apparent expectation that
  she would follow him; and Mrs. Gay, who was regarding her with a certain
  melancholy conviction that Jean's time as leading woman was short indeed. She
  pursed her lips with a rueful resignation, and followed Gil to the spring
  behind the house.</p>

  <p>"Say, you mustn't hand out things like that, Jean!" he protested, when
  they were quite out of sight and hearing of the others. "Let me give you a
  tip, girl. If you've got any photo-play ideas that are worth talking about,
  don't go spreading them out like that for Bobby to pick and choose!"</p>

  <p>"Pick to pieces, you mean," Jean corrected. help it; he's putting on some
  awfully stagey plots, and they cost just as much to produce as&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen here. You've got me wrong. That plot of yours could be worked up
  into a dandy series; the idea of a story running through a lot of pictures is
  great. What I mean is, it's worth something. You don't have to give stuff
  like that away, make him a present of it, you know. I just want to put you
  wise. If you've got anything that's worth using, make 'em pay for it. Put 'er
  into scenario form and sell it to 'em. You're in this game to make money, so
  why overlook a bet like that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Gil! Could I?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, you could! No reason why you shouldn't, if you can deliver the
  goods. Burns has been writing his own plays to fit his company; but aside
  from the features you've been putting into it, it's old stuff. He's a darned
  good director, and all that, but he hasn't got the knack of building real
  stories. You see what I mean. If you have, why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said Jean with a sudden small doubt of her literary talents,
  "if I have!"</p>

  <p>"Sure, you have!" Gil's faith in Jean was of the kind that scorns proof.
  "You see, you've got the dope on the West, and he knows it. Why, I've been
  watching how he takes the cue from you right along for his features. Ever
  since you told Lee Milligan how to lay a saddle on the ground, Burns has been
  getting tips; and half the time you didn't even know you were giving them.
  Get into this game right, Jean. Make 'em pay for that kind of thing."</p>

  <p>Jean regarded him thoughtfully, tempted to yield. "Mrs. Gay says a hundred
  dollars a week&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's good pay for a beginner. She's right, and she's wrong. They're
  featuring you in stuff that nobody else can do. Who would they put in your
  place, to do the stunts you've been doing? Muriel Gay was a good actress, and
  as good a Western lead as they could produce; and you know how she stacked up
  alongside you. You're in a class by yourself, Jean. You want to keep that in
  mind. They aren't just trying to be nice to you; it's hard-boiled business
  with the Great Western. You're going awfully strong with the public. Why, my
  chum writes me that you're announced ahead on the screen at one of the best
  theaters on Broadway! `Coming: Jean Douglas in So-and-so.' Do you know what
  that means? No, you don't; of course not. But let me tell you that it means a
  whole lot! I wish I'd had a chance to tip you off to a little business
  caution before you signed that contract. That salary clause should have been
  doctored to make a sliding scale of it. As it is, you're stuck for a year at
  a hundred dollars a week, unless you spring something the contract does not
  cover. Don't give away any more dope. You've got an idea there, if Burns will
  let you work up to it. Make 'em pay for it."</p>

  <p>"O-h-h, Gil!" came the throaty call of Burns; and Gil, with a last,
  earnest warning, left her hurriedly.</p>

  <p>Jean sat down on a rock and meditated, her chin in her palms, and her
  elbows on her knees. Vague shadows; of thoughts clouded her mind and then
  slowly clarified into definite ideas. Unconsciously she had been growing away
  from her first formulated plans. She was gradually laying aside the idea of
  reaching wealth and fame by way of the story-trail. She was almost at the
  point of admitting to herself that her story, as far as she had gone with it,
  could never be taken seriously by any one with any pretense of intelligence.
  It was too unreal, too fantastic. It was almost funny, in the most tragic
  parts. She was ready now to dismiss the book as she had dismissed her earlier
  ambitions to become a poet.</p>

  <p>But if she and Lite together could really act a story that had the stamp
  of realism which she instinctively longed for, surely it would be worth
  while. And if she herself could build the picture story they would later
  enact before the camera,&mdash;that would be better, much better than writing
  silly things about an impossible heroine in the hope of later selling the
  stuff!</p>

  <p>Automatically her thoughts swung over to the actual building of the scenes
  that would make for continuity of her lately-conceived plot. Because she knew
  every turn and every crook of that coulee and every board in the buildings
  snuggled within it, she began to plan her scenes to fit the Lazy A, and her
  action to fit the spirit of the country and those countless small details of
  life which go to make what we call the local color of the place.</p>

  <p>There never had been an organized gang of outlaws just here in this part
  of the country, but&mdash;there might have been. Her dad could remember when
  Sid Cummings and his bunch hung out in the Bad Lands fifty miles to the east
  of there. Neither had she ever had a brother, for that matter; and of her
  mother she had no more than the indistinct memory of a time when there had
  been a long, black box in the middle of the living-room, and a lot of people,
  and tears which fell upon her face and tickled her nose when her father held
  her tightly in his arms.</p>

  <p>But she had the country, and she had Lite Avery, and to her it was very,
  very easy to visualize a story that had no foundation in fact. It was what
  she had done ever since she could remember&mdash;the day-dreaming that had
  protected her from the keen edge of her loneliness.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; A NEW KIND OF PICTURE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WHAT you doing now?" Robert Grant Burns came around the
  corner of the house looking for her, half an hour later, and found her
  sitting on the doorstep with the old atlas on her knees and her hat far back
  on her head, scribbling away for dear life.</p>

  <p>Jean smiled abstractedly up at him. "Why, I'm&mdash; why-y, I'm becoming a
  famous scenario writer! Do you want me to go and plaster my face with grease-
  paint, and become a mere common leading lady again?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't." Robert Grant Burns chuckled fatly and held out his hand
  with a big, pink cameo on his little finger. "Let's see what a famous
  scenario looks like. What is it,&mdash;that plot you were telling me awhile
  ago?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes. I'm putting on the meat." There was a slight hesitation before
  Jean handed him the pages she had done. "I expect it's awfully crude," she
  apologized, with one of her diffident spells. "I'm afraid you'll laugh at
  me."</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns was reading rapidly, mentally photographing the scenes
  as he went along. He held out his hand again without looking toward her.
  "Lemme take your pencil a minute. I believe I'd have a panoram of the
  coulee,&mdash;a long shot from out there in the meadow. And show the brother
  and you leaving the house and riding toward the camera; at the gate, you
  separate. You're going to town, say. He rides on toward the hills. That fixes
  you both as belonging here at the ranch, identifies you two and the home
  ranch both in thirty feet or so of the film, with a leader that tells you're
  brother and sister. See what I mean?" He scribbled a couple of lines, crossed
  out a couple, and went on reading to where he had interrupted Jean in the
  middle of a sentence.</p>

  <p>"I see you're writing in a part for that Lite Avery; how do you know he'd
  do it? Or can put it over if he tries? He don't look to me like an
  actor."</p>

  <p>"Lite," declared Jean with a positiveness that would have thrilled Lite,
  had he heard her, "can put over anything he tries to put over. And he'll do
  it, if I tell him he must!" Which showed what were Jean's ideas, at least on
  the subject of which was the master.</p>

  <p>"What you going to call it a The Perils of the Prairie, say?" Burns
  abandoned further argument on the subject of Lite's ability.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! That's awfully cheap. That would stamp it as a melodrama before
  any of the picture appeared on the screen."</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns had not been serious; he had been testing Jean's
  originality. "Well, what will we call it, then?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, we'll call it&mdash;" Jean nibbled the rubber on her pencil and
  looked at him with that unseeing, introspective gaze which was a trick of
  hers. "We'll call it&mdash;does it hurt if we use real names that we've a
  right to?" She got a head-shake for answer. "Well, we'll call it,&mdash;let's
  just call it&mdash;Jean, of the Lazy A. Would that sound as if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Great! Girl, you're a winner! Jean, of the Lazy A! Say, that title alone
  will jump the releases ten per cent., if I know the game. Featuring Jean
  herself; pictures made right at the Lazy A Ranch. Say, the dope I can give
  our publicity man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Thereupon Jean, remembering Gil Huntley's lecture on the commercial side
  of the proposition, startled his enthusiasm with one naive question.</p>

  <p>"How much will the Great Western Film Company pay me extra for furnishing
  the story I play in? "</p>

  <p>"How much?" Robert Grant Burns blurted the words automatically.</p>

  <p>"Yes. How much? If it will jump your releases ten per cent. they ought to
  pay me quite a lot more than they're paying me now."</p>

  <p>"You're doing pretty well as it is," Burns reminded her, with a visible
  dampening of his eagerness.</p>

  <p>"For keeping your cut-and-dried stories from falling flat, yes. But for
  writing the kind of play that will have just as many `punches' and still be
  true to life, and then for acting it all out and putting in those
  punches,&mdash;that's a different matter, Mr. Burns. And you'll have to pay
  Lite a decent salary, or I'll quit right here. I'm thinking up stunts for us
  two that are awfully risky. You'll have to pay for that. But it will be worth
  while. You wait till you see Lite in action!"</p>

  <p>Gil would have been exuberant over the literal manner in which Jean was
  taking his advice and putting it to the test, had he overheard her driving
  her bargain with Robert Grant Burns. He would have been exuberant, but he
  would never have dared to say the things that Jean said, or to have taken the
  stand that she took. Robert Grant Burns found himself very much in the
  position which Lite had occupied for three years. He had well-defined ideas
  upon the subject before them, and he had the outer semblance of authority;
  but his ideas and his authority had no weight whatever with Jean, since she
  had made up her mind.</p>

  <p>Before Jean left the subject of salary, Robert Grant Burns found himself
  committed to a promise of an increase, provided that Jean really "delivered
  the goods" in the shape of a scenario serial, and did the stunts which she
  declared she could and would do.</p>

  <p>Before she settled down to the actual planning of scenes, Robert Grant
  Burns had also yielded to her demands for Lite Avery, though you may think
  that he thereby showed himself culpably weak, unless you realize what sort of
  a person Jean was in argument. Without having more than a good-morning
  acquaintance with Lite, Burns agreed to put him on "in stock" and to pay him
  the salary Jean demanded for him, provided that, in the try-out of the first
  picture, Lite should prove he could deliver the goods. Burns was always
  extremely firm in the matter of having the "goods" delivered; that was why he
  was the Great Western's leading director. Mere dollars he would yield, if
  driven into a corner and kept there long enough, but he must have
  results.</p>

  <p>These things being settled, they spent about two hours on the doorstep of
  Jean's room, writing the first reel of the story; which is to say that Jean
  wrote, and Burns took each sheet from her hands as it was finished, and read
  and made certain technical revisions now and then. Several times he grunted
  words of approbation, and several times he let his fat, black cigar go out,
  while he</p>

  <p>visualized the scenes which Jean's flying pencil portrayed.</p>

  <p>"I'll go over and get Lite," she said at last, rubbing the cramp out of
  her writing-hand and easing her shoulders from their strain of stooping.
  "There'll be time, while you send the machine after some real hats for your
  rustlers. Those toadstool things were never seen in this country till you
  brought them in your trunk; and this story is going to be real! Your rustlers
  won't look much different from the punchers, except that they'll be riding
  different horses; we'll have to get some paint somewhere and make a pinto out
  of that wall-eyed cayuse Gil rides mostly. He'll lead the rustlers, and you
  want the audience to be able to spot him a mile off. Lite and I will fix the
  horse; we'll put spots on him like a horse Uncle Carl used to own."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you can't get Lite," Burns pointed out, eyeing her over a match
  blaze. "He never acted to me like he had the movie-fever at all. Passes us up
  with a nod, and has never showed signs of life on the subject. Lee can ride
  pretty well," he added artfully, "even if he wasn't born in the saddle. And
  we can fake that rope work."</p>

  <p>"All right; you can send the machine in with a wire to your company for a
  leading woman." Jean picked up her gloves and turned to pull the door shut
  behind her, and by other signs and tokens made plain her intention to
  leave.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, you can see if he'll come. I said I'd try him out,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He'll come. I told you that before." Jean stopped and looked at her
  director coldly. "And you'll keep your word. And we won't have any fake stuff
  in this&mdash;except the spots on the pinto." She smiled then. "We wouldn't
  do that, but there isn't a pinto in the country right now that would be what
  we want. You had better get your bunch together, because I'll be back in a
  little while with Lite."</p>

  <p>As it happened, Lite was on his way to the Lazy A, and met Jean in the
  bottom of the sandy hollow. His eyes lightened when he saw her come loping up
  to him. But when she was close enough to read the expression of his face, it
  was schooled again to the frank friendship which Jean always had accepted as
  a matter of course.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Lite! I've got a job for you with the movies," Jean announced, as
  soon as she was within speaking distance. "You can come right back with me
  and begin. It's going to be great. We're going to make a real Western
  picture, Lite, you and I. Lee and Gil and all the rest will be in it, of
  course; but we're going to put in the real West. And we're going to put in
  the ranch,&mdash;the REAL Lazy A, Lite. Not these dinky little sets that
  Burns has toggled up with bits of the bluff showing for background, but the
  ranch just as it&mdash;it used to be." Jean's eyes grew wistful while she
  looked at him and told him her plans.</p>

  <p>"I'm writing the scenario myself," she explained, "and that's why you have
  to be in it. I've written in stuff that the other boys can't do to save their
  lives. REAL stuff, Lite! You and I are going to run the ranch and punch the
  cows,&mdash;Lazy A cattle, what there are left of them,&mdash;and hunt down a
  bunch of rustlers that have their hangout somewhere down in the breaks; we
  don't know just where, yet. The places we'll ride, they'll need an airship to
  follow with the camera! I haven't got it all planned yet, but the first reel
  is about done; we're going to begin on it this afternoon. We'll need you in
  the first scenes,&mdash;just ranch scenes, with you and Lee; he's my brother,
  and he'll get killed&mdash; Now, what's the matter with you?" She stopped and
  eyed him disapprovingly. "Why have you got that stubborn look to your mouth?
  Lite, see here. Before you say a word, I want to tell you that you are not to
  refuse this. It&mdash;it means money, Lite; for you, and for me, too. And
  that means&mdash;dad at home again. Lite&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bite looked at her, looked away and bit his lips. It was long since he had
  seen tears in Jean's steady, brown eyes, and the sight of them hurt him
  intolerably. There was nothing that he could say to strengthen her faith,
  absolutely nothing. He did not see how money could free her father before his
  sentence expired. Her faith in her dad seemed to Lite a wonderful thing, but
  he himself could not altogether share it, although he had lately come to feel
  a very definite doubt about Aleck's guilt. Money could not help them, except
  that it could buy back the Lazy A and restock it, and make of it the home it
  had been three years ago.</p>

  <p>Lite, in the secret heart of him, did not want Jean to set her heart on
  doing that. Lite was almost in a position to do it himself, just as he had
  planned and schemed and saved to do, ever since the day when he took Jean to
  the Bar Nothing, and announced to her that he intended to take care of her in
  place of her father. He had wanted to surprise Jean; and Jean, with her usual
  headlong energy bent upon the same object, seemed in a fair way to forestall
  him, unless he moved very quickly.</p>

  <p>"Lite, you won't spoil everything now, just when I'm given this great
  opportunity, will you?" Jean's voice was steady again. She could even meet
  his eyes without flinching. "Gil says it's a great opportunity, in every way.
  It's a series of pictures, really, and they are to be called `Jean, of the
  Lazy A.' Gil says they will be advertised a lot, and make me famous. I don't
  care about that; but the company will pay me more, and that means&mdash;that
  means that I can get out and find Art Osgood sooner, and&mdash;get dad home.
  And you will have to help. The whole thing, as I have planned it, depends
  upon you, Lite. The riding and the roping, and stuff like that, you'll have
  to do. You'll have to work right alongside me in all that outdoor stuff,
  because I am going to quit doing all those spectacular, stagey stunts, and
  get down to real business. I've made Burns see that there will be money in it
  for his company, so he is perfectly willing to let me go ahead with it and do
  it my way. Our way, Lite, because, once you start with it, you can help me
  plan things." Whereupon, having said almost everything she could think of
  that would tend to soften that stubborn look in Lite's face, Jean waited.</p>

  <p>Lite did a great deal of thinking in the next two or three minutes, but
  being such a bottled-up person, he did not say half of what he thought; and
  Jean, closely as she watched his face, could not read what was in his mind.
  Of Aleck he thought, and the slender chance there was of any one doing what
  Jean hoped to do; of Art Osgood, and the meager possibility that Art could
  shed any light upon the killing of Johnny Croft; of the Lazy A, and the
  probable price that Carl would put upon it if he were asked to sell the ranch
  and the stock; of the money he had already saved, and the chance that, if he
  went to Carl now and made him an offer, Carl would accept. He weighed
  mentally all the various elements that went to make up the depressing tangle
  of the whole affair, and decided that he would write at once to Rossman, the
  lawyer who had defended Aleck, and put the whole thing into his hands. He
  would then know just where he stood, and what he would have to do, and what
  legal steps he must take.</p>

  <p>He looked at Jean and grinned a little. "I'm not pretty enough for a
  picture actor," he said whimsically. "Better let me be a rustler and wear a
  mask, if you don't want folks to throw fits."</p>

  <p>"You'll be what I want you to be," Jean told him with the little smile in
  her eyes that Lite had learned to love more than he could ever say. "I'm
  going to make us both famous, Lite. Now, come on, Bobby Burns has probably
  chewed up a whole box of those black cigars, waiting for us to show up."</p>

  <p>I am not going to describe the making of "Jean, of the Lazy A." It would
  be interesting, but this is not primarily a story of the motion-picture
  business, remember. It is the story of the Lazy A and the problem that both
  Jean and Lite were trying to solve. The Great Western Film Company became,
  through sheer chance, a factor in that problem, and for that reason we have
  come into rather close touch with them; but aside from the fact that Jean's
  photo-play brought Lite into the company and later took them both to Los
  Angeles, this particular picture has no great bearing upon the matter.</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns had intended taking his company back to Los Angles in
  August, when the hot winds began to sweep over the range land. But Jean's
  story was going "big." Jean was throwing herself into the part heart and
  mind. She lived it. With Lite riding beside her, helping her with all his
  skill and energy and much enthusiasm, she almost forgot her great undertaking
  sometimes, she was so engrossed with her work. With his experience,
  suggesting frequent changes, she added new touches of realism to this story
  that made the case-hardened audience of the Great Western's private
  projection room invent new ways of voicing their enthusiasm, when the
  negative films Pete Lowry sent in to headquarters were printed and given
  their trial run.</p>

  <p>They were just well started when August came with its hot winds. They
  stayed and worked upon the serial until it was finished, and that meant that
  they stayed until the first October blizzard caught them while they were
  finishing the last reel.</p>

  <p>Do you know what they did then? Jean changed a few scenes around at Lite's
  suggestion, and they went out into the hills in the teeth of the storm and
  pictured Jean lost in the blizzard, and coming by chance upon the outlaws at
  their camp, which she and Lite and Lee had been hunting through all the
  previous installments of the story. It was great stuff,&mdash;that ride Jean
  made in the blizzard,&mdash;and that scene where, with numbed fingers and
  snow matted in her dangling braid, she held up the rustlers and marched them
  out of the hills, and met Lite coming in search of her.</p>

  <p>You will remember it, if you have been frequenting the silent drama and
  were fortunate enough to see the picture. You may have wondered at the
  realism of those blizzard scenes, and you may have been curious to know how
  the camera got the effect. It was wonderful photography, of course; but then,
  the blizzard was real, and that pinched, half frozen look on Jean's face in
  the close-up where she met Lite was real. Jean was so cold when she turned
  the rustlers over to Lite that when she started to dismount and fell in a
  heap,&mdash;you remember?&mdash;she was not acting at all. Neither was Lite
  acting when he plunged through the drift and caught Jean in his arms and held
  her close against him just as that scene ended. In the name of realism they
  cut the scene, because Lite showed that he forgot all about the outlaws and
  the part he was playing.</p>

  <p>So they finished the picture, and the whole company packed their trunks
  thankfully and turned their faces and all their thoughts westward.</p>

  <p>Jean was not at all sure that she wanted to go. It seemed almost as though
  she were setting aside her great undertaking; as though she were weakly
  deserting her dad when she closed the door for the last time upon her room
  and turned her back upon Lazy A coulee. But there were certain things which
  comforted her; Lite was going along to look after the horses, he told her
  just the day before they started. For Robert Grant Burns, with an eye to the
  advertising value of the move, had decided that Pard must go with them. He
  would have to hire an express car, anyway, he said, for the automobile and
  the scenery sets they had used for interiors. And there would be plenty of
  room for Pard and Lite's horse and another which Robert Grant Burns had used
  to carry him to locations in rough country, where the automobile could not
  go. The car would run in passenger service, Burns said,&mdash;he'd fix
  that,&mdash;so Lite would be right with the company all the way out.</p>

  <p>Jean appreciated all that as a personal favor, which merely proved how
  unsophisticated she really was. She did not know that Robert Grant Burns was
  thinking chiefly of furnishing material for the publicity man to use in news
  stories. She never once dreamed that the coming of "Jean, of the Lazy A" and
  Jean's pet horse Pard, and of Lite, who had done so many surprising things in
  the picture, would be heralded in all the Los Angeles papers before ever they
  left Montana.</p>

  <p>Jean was concerned chiefly with attending to certain matters which seemed
  to her of vital importance. If she must go, there was something which she
  must do first,&mdash;something which for three years she had shrunk from
  doing. So she told Robert Grant Burns that she would meet him and his company
  in Helena, and without a word of explanation, she left two days in advance of
  them, just after she had had another maddening talk with her Uncle Carl,
  wherein she had repeated her intention of employing a lawyer.</p>

  <p>When she boarded the train at Helena, she did not tell even Lite just
  where she had been or what she had been doing. She did not need to tell Lite.
  He looked into her face and saw there the shadow of the high, stone wall that
  shut her dad away from the world, and he did not ask a single question.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19">XIX.&mdash; IN LOS ANGELES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN she felt bewildered, Jean had the trick of appearing
  merely reserved; and that is what saved her from the charge of rusticity when
  Robert Grant Burns led her through the station gateway and into a small
  reception. No less a man than Dewitt, President of the Great Western Film
  Company, clasped her hand and held it, while he said how glad he was to
  welcome her. Jean, unawed by his greatness and the honor he was paying her,
  looked up at him with that distracting little beginning of a smile, and
  replied with that even-more distracting little drawl in her voice, and
  wondered why Mrs. Gay should become so plainly flustered all at once.</p>

  <p>Dewitt took her by the arm, introduced her to a curious-eyed group with a
  warming cordiality of manner, and led her away through a crowd that stared
  and whispered, and up to a great, beautiful, purple machine with a colored
  chauffeur in dust-colored uniform. Dewitt was talking easily of trivial
  things, and shooting a question now and then over his shoulder at Robert
  Grant Burns, who had shed much of his importance and seemed indefinably
  subservient toward Mr. Dewitt. Jean turned toward him abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Where's Lite? Did you send some one to help him with Pard?" she asked
  with real concern in her voice. "Those three horses aren't used to towns the
  size of this, Mr. Burns. Lite is going to have his hands full with Pard. If
  you will excuse me, Mr. Dewitt, I think I'll go and see how he's making
  out."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dewitt glanced over her head and met the delighted grin of Jim Gates,
  the publicity manager. The grin said that Jean was "running true to form,"
  which was a pet simile with Jim Gates, and usually accompanied that
  particular kind of grin. There would be an interesting half column in the
  next day's papers about Jean's arrival and her deep concern for Lite and her
  wonderful horse Pard, but of course she did not know that.</p>

  <p>"I've got men here to help with the horses," Mr. Dewitt assured her, while
  he gently urged her into the machine. "They'll be brought right out to the
  studio. I'm taking you home with me in obedience to my wife's, orders. She is
  anxious to meet the young woman who can out-ride and out-shoot any man on the
  screen, and can still be sweet and feminine and lovable. I'm quoting my wife,
  you see, though I won't say those are not my sentiments also."</p>

  <p>"Your poor wife is going to receive a shock," said Jean in an unimpressed
  tone. "But it's dear of her to want to meet me." Back of her speech was an
  irritated impatience that she should be gobbled and carried off like this,
  when she was sure that she ought to be helping Lite get that fool Pard
  unloaded and safely through the clang and clatter of the down-town
  district.</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns, half facing her on a folding seat, sent her a queer,
  puzzled glance from under his eyebrows. Four months had Jean been working
  under his direction; four months had he studied her, and still she puzzled
  him. She was not ignorant&mdash;the girl had been out among civilized folks
  and had learned town ways; she was not stupid&mdash;she could keep him
  guessing, and he thought he knew all the quirks of human nature, too. Then
  why, in the name of common sense, did she take Dewitt and his patronage in
  this matter-of-fact way, as if it were his everyday business to meet strange
  employees and take them home to his wife? He glanced at Dewitt and caught a
  twinkle of perfect understanding in the bright blue eyes of his chief. Burns
  made a sound between a grunt and a chuckle, and turned his eyes away
  immediately; but Dewitt chose to make speech upon the subject.</p>

  <p>"You haven't spoiled our new leading woman&mdash; yet," he observed
  idly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, but he has," Jean dissented. "He has got me trained so that when he
  says smile, my mouth stretches itself automatically. When he says sob, I sob.
  He just snaps his fingers, Mr. Dewitt, and I sit up and go through my tricks
  very nicely. You ought to see how nicely I do them."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dewitt put up a hand and pulled at his close- cropped, white mustache
  that could not hide the twitching of his lips. "I have seen," he said drily,
  and leaned forward for a word with the liveried chauffeur. "Turn up on
  Broadway and stop at the Victoria," he said, and the chin of the driver
  dropped an inch to prove he heard.</p>

  <p>Dewitt laid his fingers on Jean's arm to catch her attention. "Do you see
  that picture on the billboard over there?" he asked, with a special
  inflection in his nice, crisp voice. "Does it look familiar to you?"</p>

  <p>Jean looked, and pinched her brows together. Just at first she did not
  comprehend. There was her name in fancy letters two feet high: "JEAN, OF THE
  LAZY A." It blared at the passer-by, but it did not look familiar at all.
  Beneath was a high-colored poster of a girl on a horse. The horse was
  standing on its hind feet, pawing the air; its nostrils flared red; its tail
  swept like a willow plume behind. The machine slowed and stopped for the
  traffic signal at the crossing, and still Jean studied the poster. It
  certainly did not look in the least familiar.</p>

  <p>"Is that supposed to be me, on that plum-colored horse?" she drawled, when
  they slid out slowly in the wake of a great truck.</p>

  <p>"Why, don't you like it?" Dewitt looked at Jim Gates, who was again
  grinning delightedly and surreptitiously scribbling something on the margin
  of a folded paper he was carrying.</p>

  <p>Jean turned upon him a mildly resentful glance. "No, I don't. Pard is not
  purple; he's brown. And he's got the dearest white hoofs and a white sock on
  his left hind foot; and he doesn't snort fire and brimstone, either." She
  glanced anxiously at the jam of wagons and automobiles and clanging
  street-cars. "I don't know, though," she amended ruefully, "I think perhaps
  he will, too, when he sees all this. I really ought to have stayed with
  him."</p>

  <p>"You don't think Lite quite capable of taking care of him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, of course he is! But I just feel that way."</p>

  <p>Dewitt shifted a little, so that he was half facing her, and could look at
  her without having to turn his head. If his eyes told anything of his
  thoughts, the President of the Great Western Film Company was curious to know
  how she felt about her position and her sudden fame and the work itself.
  Before they had worked their way into the next block, he decided that Jean
  was not greatly interested in any of these things, and he wondered why.</p>

  <p>The machine slowed, swung to the curb, and crept forward and stopped in
  front of the Victoria. Dewitt looked at Burns and Pete Lowry, who was on the
  front seat.</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd like to take a glance at the lobby display the Victoria
  is making," he said casually. "They are running the Lazy A series, you
  know,&mdash;to capacity houses, too, they tell me. Shall we get out?"</p>

  <p>The chauffeur reached back with that gesture of toleration and infinite
  boredom common to his kind and swung open the door.</p>

  <p>Robert Grant Burns started up. "Come on, Jean," he said eagerly. "I don't
  suppose that eternal calm of yours will ever show a wrinkle on the surface,
  but let's have a look, anyway."</p>

  <p>Pete Lowry was already out and half way across the pavement. Pete had lain
  awake in his bed, many's the night, planning the posing of "stills" that
  would show Jean at her best; he had visioned them on display in theater
  lobbies, and now he collided with a hurrying shopper in his haste to see the
  actual fulfillment of those plans.</p>

  <p>Jean herself was not so eager. She went with the others, and she saw
  herself pictured on Pard; on her two feet; and sitting upon a rock with her
  old Stetson tilted over one eye and her hair tousled with the wind. She was
  loading her six-shooter, and talking to Lite, who was sitting on his heels
  with a cigarette in his fingers, looking at her with that bottled-up look in
  his eyes. She did not remember when the picture was taken, but she liked that
  best of all. She saw herself leaning out of the window of her room at the
  Lazy A. She remembered that time. She was talking to Gil outside, and Pete
  had come up and planted his tripod directly in front of her, and had
  commanded her to hold her pose. She did not count them, but she had curious
  impressions of dozens of pictures of herself scattered here and there along
  the walls of the long, cool-looking lobby. Every single one of them was
  marked: "Jean, of the Lazy A." Just that.</p>

  <p>On a bulletin board in the middle of the entrance, just before the marble
  box-office, it was lettered again in dignified black type: "JEAN OF THE LAZY
  A." Below was one word: "To-day."</p>

  <p>"It looks awfully queer," said Jean to Mr. Dewitt, who wanted to know what
  she thought of it all; "they don't explain what it's all about, or
  anything."</p>

  <p>"No, they don't." Dewitt pulled his mustache and piloted her back to the
  machine. "They don't have to."</p>

  <p>"No," echoed Robert Grant Burns, with the fat chuckle of utter content in
  the knowledge of having achieved something. "From the looks of things, they
  don't have to." He looked at Jean so intently that she stared back at him,
  wondering what was the matter; and when he saw that she was wondering, he
  gave a snort.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" he said to himself, just above a whisper, and looked away,
  despairing of ever reading the riddle of Jean's unshakable composure. Was it
  pose Was the girl phlegmatic,&mdash;with that face which was so alive with
  the thoughts that shuttled back and forth behind those steady, talking eyes
  of hers? She was not stupid; Robert Grant Burns knew to his own discomfiture
  that she was not stupid. Nor was she one to pose; the absolute sincerity of
  her terrific frankness was what had worried Robert Grant Burns most. She must
  know that she had jumped into the front rank of popular actresses, and stood
  out before them all,&mdash;for the time being, at least. And,&mdash;he stole
  a measuring sidelong glance at her, just as he had done thousands of times in
  the past four months,&mdash;here she was in the private machine of the
  President of the Great Western Film Company, with that great man himself
  talking to her as to his honored guest. She had seen herself featured alone
  at one of the biggest motion-picture theaters in Los Angeles; so well known
  that "Jean, of the Lazy A" was deemed all-sufficient as information and
  advertisement. She had reached what seemed to Robert Grant Burns the final
  heights. And the girl sat there, calm, abstracted, actually not listening to
  Dewitt when he talked! She was not even thinking about him! Robert Grant
  Burns gave her another quick, resentful glance, and wondered what under
  heaven the girl WAS thinking about.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, having accepted the fact that she seemed to have made
  a success of her pictures, her thoughts had drifted to what seemed to her
  more vital. Had she done wrong to come away out here, away from her problem?
  The distance worried her. She had not even found out who was the mysterious
  night-prowler, or what he wanted. He had never come again, after that night
  when Hepsy had scared him away. From long thinking about it, she had come to
  a vague, general belief that his visits were somehow connected with the
  murder; but in what manner, she could not even form a theory. That worried
  her. She wished now that she had told Lite about it. She was foolish not to
  have done something, instead of sticking her head under the bedclothes and
  just shivering till he left. Lite would have found out who the man was, and
  what he wanted. Lite would never have let him come and go like that. But the
  visits had seemed so absolutely without reason. There was nothing to steal,
  and nothing to find. Still, she wished she had told Lite, and let him find
  out who it was.</p>

  <p>Then her talk with the great lawyer had been disquieting. He had not
  wanted to name his fee for defending her dad; but when he had named it, it
  did not seem so enormous as she had imagined it to be. He had asked a great
  many questions, and most of them puzzled Jean. He had said that he would take
  up the matter,&mdash;by which she believed he meant an investigation of her
  uncle's title to the Lazy A. He said that he would see her father, and he
  told her that he had already been retained to investigate the whole thing, so
  that she need not worry about having to pay him a fee. That, he said, had
  already been arranged, though he did not feel at liberty to name his client.
  But he wanted to assure her that everything was being done that could be
  done.</p>

  <p>She herself had seen her father. She shrank within herself and tried not
  to think of that horrible meeting. Her soul writhed under the tormenting
  memory of how she had seen him. She had not been able to talk to him at all,
  scarcely. The words would not come. She had said that she and Lite were on
  their way to Los Angeles, and would be there all winter. He had patted her
  shoulder with a tragic apathy in his manner, and had said that the change
  would do her good. And that was all she could remember that they had talked
  about. And then the guard came, and&mdash;</p>

  <p>That is what she was thinking about while the big, purple machine slid
  smoothly through the tunnel, negotiated a rough stretch where the
  street-pavers were at work, and sped purring out upon the boulevard that
  stretched away to Hollywood and the hills. That was what she kept hidden
  behind the "eternal calm" that so irritated Robert Grant Burns and so
  delighted Dewitt and so interested Jim Gates, who studied her for what "copy"
  there was in her personality.</p>

  <p>It was the same when, the next day, Dewitt himself took her over to the
  big plant which he spoke of as the studio. It was immense, and yet Jean
  seemed unimpressed. She was gladder to see Pard and Lite again than she was
  to meet the six-hundred-a-week star whose popularity she seemed in a fair way
  to outrival. Men and women who were "in stock," and therefore within the
  social pale, were introduced to her and said nice, hackneyed things about how
  they admired her work and were glad to welcome her. She felt the warm air of
  good-fellowship that followed her everywhere. All of these people seemed to
  accept her at once as one of themselves. When she noticed it, she was amused
  at the way the "extras" stood back and looked at her and whispered together.
  More than once she overheard what seemed almost to have become a catch-phrase
  out here; "Jean of the lazy A" was the phrase.</p>

  <p>Jean was not made of wood, understand. In a manner she recognized all
  these little tributes, and to a certain degree she appreciated them. She was
  glad that she had made such a success of it, but she was glad because it
  would help her to take her dad away from that horrible, ghastly place and
  that horrible, ghastly death- in-life under which he lived. In three years he
  had grown old and stooped&mdash;her dad!</p>

  <p>And Burns twitted her ironically because she could not simper and lose her
  head over the attentions these people were loading upon her! Save for the
  fact that in this way she could earn a good deal of money, and could pay that
  lawyer Rossman, and trace Art Osgood, she would not have stayed; she could
  not have endured the staying. For the easier they made life for her, the
  greater contrast did they make between her and her dad.</p>

  <p>Gil brought her a great bunch of roses, unbelievably beautiful and
  fragrant, and laughed and told her they didn't look much like those
  snowdrifts she waded through the last day they worked on the Lazy A serial.
  For just a minute he thought Jean was going to throw them at him, and he
  worried himself into sleeplessness, poor boy, wondering how he had offended
  her, and how he could make amends. Could he have looked into Jean's soul, he
  would have seen that it was seared with the fresh memory of iron bars and
  high walls and her dad who never saw any roses; and that the contrast between
  their beauty and the terrible barrenness that surrounded him was like a blow
  in her face.</p>

  <p>Dewitt himself sensed that something was wrong with her. She was not her
  natural self, and he knew it, though his acquaintance with her was a matter
  of hours only. Part of his business it was to study people, to read them; he
  read Jean now, in a general way. Not being a clairvoyant, he of course had no
  inkling of the very real troubles that filled her mind, though the effect of
  those troubles he saw quite plainly. He watched her quietly for a day, and
  then he applied the best remedy he knew.</p>

  <p>"You've just finished a long, hard piece of work," he said in his crisp,
  matter-of-fact way, on the second morning after her arrival. "There is going
  to be a delay here while we shape things up for the winter, and it is my
  custom to keep my people in the very best condition to work right up to the
  standard. So you are all going to have a two-weeks vacation,
  Jean-of-the-Lazy- A. At full salary, of course; and to put you yourself into
  the true holiday spirit, I'm going to raise your salary to a hundred and
  seventy-five a week. I consider you worth it," he added, with a quieting
  gesture of uplifted hand, "or you may be sure I wouldn't pay it.</p>

  <p>"Get some nice old lady to chaperone you, and go and play. The ocean is
  good; get somewhere on the beach. Or go to Catalina and play there. Or stay
  here, and go to the movies. Go and see `Jean, of the Lazy A,' and watch how
  the audience lives with her on the screen. Go up and talk to the wife. She
  told me to bring you up for dinner. You go climb into my machine, and tell
  Bob to take you to the house now. Run along, Jean of the Lazy A! This is an
  order from your chief."</p>

  <p>Jean wanted to cry. She held the roses, that she almost hated for their
  very beauty and fragrance, close pressed in her arms, while she went away
  toward the machine. Dewitt looked after her, thought she meant to obey him,
  and turned to greet a great man of the town who had been waiting for five
  minutes to speak to him.</p>

  <p>Jean did not climb into the purple car and tell Bob to drive her to "the
  house." She walked past it without even noticing that it stood there, an
  aristocrat among the other machines parked behind the great studio that
  looked like a long, low warehouse. She knew the straightest, shortest trail
  to the corrals, you may be sure of that. She took that trail.</p>

  <p>Pard was standing in a far corner under a shed, switching his tail
  methodically at the October crop of flies. His head lay over the neck of a
  scrawny little buckskin, for which he had formed a sudden and violent
  attachment, and his eyes were half closed while he drowsed in lazy content.
  Pard was not worrying about anything. He looked so luxuriously happy that
  Jean had not the heart to disturb him, even with her comfort- seeking
  caresses. She leaned her elbows on the corral gate and watched him awhile.
  She asked a bashful, gum-chewing youth if he could tell her where to find
  Lite Avery. But the youth seemed never to have heard of Lite Avery, and Jean
  was too miserable to explain and describe Lite, and insist upon seeing him.
  She walked over to the nearest car-line and caught the next street car for
  the city. Part of her chief's orders at least she would obey. She would go
  down to the Victoria and see "Jean, of the Lazy A," but she was not going
  because of any impulse of vanity, or to soothe her soul with the applause of
  strangers. She wanted to see the ranch again. She wanted to see the dear,
  familiar line of the old bluff that framed the coulee, and ride again with
  Lite through those wild places they had chosen for the pictures. She wanted
  to lose herself for a little while among the hills that were home.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20">XX.&mdash; CHANCE TAKES A HAND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A HUGE pipe organ was filling the theater with a vast
  undertone that was like the whispering surge of a great wind. Jean went into
  the soft twilight and sat down, feeling that she had shut herself away from
  the harsh, horrible world that held so much of suffering. She sighed and
  leaned her head back against the curtained enclosure of the loges, and closed
  her eyes and listened to the big, sweeping harmonies that were yet so
  subdued.</p>

  <p>Down next the river, in a sheltered little coulee, there was a group of
  great bull pines. Sometimes she had gone there and leaned against a tree
  trunk, and had shut her eyes and listened to the vast symphony which the wind
  and the water played together. She forgot that she had come to see a picture
  which she had helped to create. She held her eyes shut and listened; and that
  horror of high walls and iron bars that had haunted her for days, and the
  aged, broken man who was her father, dimmed and faded and was temporarily
  erased; the lightness of her lips eased a little; the tenseness relaxed from
  her face, as it does from one who sleeps.</p>

  <p>But the music changed, and her mood changed with it. She did not know that
  this was because the story pictured upon the screen had changed, but she sat
  up straight and opened her eyes, and felt almost as though she had just
  awakened from a vivid dream.</p>

  <p>A Mexican series of educational pictures were being shown. Jean looked,
  and leaned forward with a little gasp. But even as she fixed her eyes and
  startled attention upon it, that scene was gone, and she was reading
  mechanically of refugees fleeing to the border line.</p>

  <p>She must have been asleep, she told herself, and had gotten things mixed
  up in her dreams. She shook herself mentally and remembered that she ought to
  take off her hat; and she tried to fix her mind upon the pictures. Perhaps
  she had been mistaken; perhaps she had not seen what she believed she had
  seen. But&mdash; what if it were true? What if she had really seen and not
  imagined it? It couldn't be true, she kept telling herself; of course, it
  couldn't be true! Still, her mind clung to that instant when she had first
  opened her eyes, and very little of what she saw afterwards reached her brain
  at all.</p>

  <p>Then she had, for the first time in her life, the strange experience of
  seeing herself as others saw her. The screen announcement and expectant stir
  that greeted it caught her attention, and pulled her back from the whirl of
  conjecture into which she had been plunged. She watched, and she saw herself
  ride up to the foreground on Pard. She saw herself look straight out at the
  audience with that peculiar little easing of the lips and the lightening of
  the eyes which was just the infectious beginning of a smile. Involuntarily
  she smiled back at her pictured self, just as every one else was smiling
  back. For that, you must know, was what had first endeared her so to the
  public; the human quality that compelled instinctive response from those who
  looked at her. So Jean in the loge smiled at Jean on the screen. Then
  Lite&mdash;dear, silent, long-legged Lite!&mdash;came loping up, and pushed
  back his hat with the gesture that she knew so well, and spoke to her and
  smiled; and a lump filled the throat of Jean in the loge, though she could
  not have told why. Then Jean on the screen turned and went riding with Lite
  back down the trail, with her hat tilted over one eye because of the sun, and
  with one foot swinging free of the stirrup in that absolute unconsciousness
  of pose that had first caught the attention of Robert Grant Burns and his
  camera man. Jean in the loge heard the ripple of applause among the audience
  and responded to it with a perfectly human thrill.</p>

  <p>Presently she was back at the Lazy A, living again the scenes which she
  herself had created. This was the fourth or fifth picture,&mdash;she did not
  at the moment remember just which. At any rate, it had in it that incident
  when she had first met the picture-people in the hills and mistaken Gil
  Huntley and the other boys for real rustlers stealing her uncle's cattle. You
  will remember that Robert Grant Burns had told Pete to take all of that
  encounter, and he had later told Jean to write her scenario so as to include
  that incident.</p>

  <p>Jean blushed when she saw herself ride up to those three and "throw down
  on them" with her gun. She had been terribly chagrined over that performance!
  But now it looked awfully real, she told herself with a little glow of pride.
  Poor old Gil! They hadn't caught her roping him, anyway, and she was glad of
  that. He would have looked absurd, and those people would have laughed at
  him. She watched how she had driven the cattle back up the coulee, with
  little rushes up the bank to head off an unruly cow that had ideas of her own
  about the direction in which she would travel. She loved Pard, for the way he
  tossed his head and whirled the cricket in his bit with his tongue, and
  obeyed the slightest touch on the rein. The audience applauded that cattle
  drive; and Jean was almost betrayed into applauding it herself.</p>

  <p>Later there was a scene where she had helped Lite Avery and Lee Milligan
  round up a bunch of cattle and cut out three or four, which were to be sold
  to a butcher for money to take her mother to the doctor. Lite rode close to
  the camera and looked straight at her, and Jean bit her lips sharply as tears
  stung her lashes for some inexplicable reason. Dear old Lite! Every line in
  his face she knew, every varying, vagrant expression, every little twitch of
  his lips and eyelids that meant so much to those who knew him well enough to
  read his face. Jean's eyes softened, cleared, and while she looked, her lips
  parted a little, and she did not know that she was smiling.</p>

  <p>She was thinking of the day, not long ago, when she had seen a bird fly
  into the loft over the store-house, and she had climbed in a spirit of idle
  curiosity to see what the bird wanted there. She had found Lite's bed neatly
  smoothed for the day, the pillow placed so that, lying there, he could look
  out through the opening and see the house and the path that led to it. There
  was the faint aroma of tobacco about the place. Jean had known at once just
  why that bed was there, and almost she knew how long it had been there. She
  had never once hinted that she knew; and Lite would never tell her, by look
  or word, that he was watching her welfare.</p>

  <p>Here came Gil, dashing up to the brow of the hill, dismounting and
  creeping behind a rock, that he might watch them working with the cattle in
  the valley below. Jean met his pictured approach with a little smile of
  welcome. That was the scene where she told him he got off the horse like a
  sack of oats, and had shown him how to swing down lightly and with a perfect
  balance, instead of coming to the earth with a thud of his feet. Gil had
  taken it all in good faith; the camera proved now how well he had followed
  her instructions. And afterwards, while the assistant camera-man (with whom
  Jean never had felt acquainted) shouldered the camera and tripod, and they
  all tramped down the hill to another location, there had been a little scene
  in the shade of that rock, between Jean and the star villain. She blushed a
  little and wondered if Gil remembered that tentative love-making scene which
  Burns had unconsciously cut short with a bellowing order to rehearse the next
  scene.</p>

  <p>It was wonderful, it was fascinating to sit there and see those days of
  hard, absorbing work relived in the story she had created. Jean lost herself
  in watching how Jean of the Lazy A came and went and lived her life bravely
  in the midst of so much that was hard. Jean in the loge remembered how Burns
  had yelled, "Smile when you come up; look light-hearted! And then let your
  face change gradually, while you listen to your mother crying in there.
  There'll be a cut-back to show her down on her knees crying before Bob's
  chair. Let that tired, worried look come into your face,&mdash;the load's
  dropping on to your shoulders again,&mdash;that kind of dope. Get me?" Jean
  in the loge remembered how she had been told to do this deliberately, just
  out of her imagination. And then she saw how Jean on the screen came
  whistling up to the house, swinging her quirt by its loop and with a spring
  in her walk, and making you feel that it was a beautiful day and that all the
  meadow larks were singing, and that she had just had a gallop on Pard that
  made her forget that she ever looked trouble in the face.</p>

  <p>Then Jean in the loge looked and saw screen&mdash;Jean's mother kneeling
  before Bob's chair and sobbing so that her shoulders shook. She looked and
  saw screen Jean stop whistling and swinging her quirt; saw her stand still in
  the path and listen; saw the smile fade out of her eyes. Jean in the loge
  thought suddenly of that moment when she had looked at dad coming in where
  she waited, and swallowed a lump in her throat. A woman near her gave a
  little stifled sob of sympathy when screen-Jean turned and went softly around
  the corner of the house with all the light gone from her face and all the
  spring gone out of her walk.</p>

  <p>Jean in the loge gave a sigh of relaxed tension and looked around her. The
  seats were nearly all full, and every one was gazing fixedly forward, lost in
  the pictured story of Jean on the screen. So that was what all those
  made-to-order smiles and frowns meant! Jean had done them at Burns' command,
  because she had seen that the others simulated different emotions whenever he
  told them to. She knew, furthermore, that she had done them remarkably well;
  so well that people responded to every emotion she presented to them. She was
  surprised at the vividness of every one of those cut- and-dried scenes. They
  imposed upon her, even, after all the work and fussing she had gone through
  to get them to Burns' liking. And there, in the cool gloom of the Victoria,
  Jean for the first time realized to the full the true ability of Robert Grant
  Burns. For the first time she really appreciated him and respected him, and
  was grateful to him for what he had taught her to do.</p>

  <p>Her mood changed abruptly when the Jean picture ended. The music changed
  to the strain that had filled the great place when she entered, nearly an
  hour before. Jean sat up straight again and waited, alert, impatient, anxious
  to miss no smallest part of that picture which had startled her so when she
  had first looked at the screen. If the thing was true which she half
  believed&mdash;if it were true! So she stared with narrowed lids, intent,
  watchful, her whole mind concentrated upon what she should presently see.</p>

  <p>"Warring Mexico!" That was the name of it; a Lubin special release, of the
  kind technically called "educational." Jean held her breath, waiting for the
  scene that might mean so much to her. There: this must be it, she thought
  with a flush of inner excitement. This surely must be the one:</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><small>"NOGALES, MEXICO. FEDERAL TROOPS OF GENERAL KOSTERLISKY,
  WITH<br>
  AMERICAN SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE SERVING ON STAFF OF NOTED
  GENERAL."</small></p><br>

  <p>Jean had it stamped indelibly upon her brain. She waited, with a quick
  intake of breath when the picture stood out with a sudden clarity before her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>A "close-up" group of officers and men,&mdash;and some of the men
  Americans in face, dress, and manner. But it was one man, and one only, at
  whom she looked. Tall he was, and square-shouldered and lean; with his hat
  set far back on his head and a half smile curling his lips, and his eyes
  looking straight into the camera. Standing there with his weight all on one
  foot, in that attitude which cowboys call "hipshot." Art Osgood! She was sure
  of it! Her hands clenched in her lap. Art Osgood, at Nogales, Mexico. Serving
  on the staff of General Kosterlisky. Was the man mad, to stand there publicly
  before the merciless, revealing eye of a motion-picture camera? Or did his
  vanity blind him to the risk he was taking?</p>

  <p>The man at whom she sat glaring glanced sidewise at some person unseen;
  and Jean knew that glance, that turn of the head. He smiled anew and lifted
  his American-made Stetson a few inches above his head and held it so in
  salute. Just so had he lifted and held his hat high one day, when she had
  turned and ridden away from him down the trail. Jean caught herself just as
  her lips opened to call out to him in recognition and sharp reproach. He
  turned and walked away to where the troopers were massed in the background.
  It was thus that she had first glimpsed him for one instant before the scene
  ended; it was just as he turned his face away that she had opened her eyes,
  and thought it was Art Osgood who was walking away from the camera.</p>

  <p>She waited a minute, staring abstractedly at the refugees who were
  presented next. She wished that she knew when the picture had been
  taken,&mdash;how long ago. Her experience with motion-picture making, her
  listening to the shop-talk of the company, had taught her much; she knew that
  sometimes weeks elapse between the camera's work and the actual projection of
  a picture upon the theater screens. Still, this was, in a sense, a news
  release, and therefore in all probability hurried to the public. Art Osgood
  might still be at Nogales, Mexico, wherever that was. He might; and Jean made
  up her mind and laid her plans while she sat there pinning on her hat.</p>

  <p>She got up quietly and slipped out. She was going to Nogales, Mexico,
  wherever that was. She was going to get Art Osgood, and she didn't care
  whether she had to fight her way clear through "Warring Mexico." She would
  find him and get him and bring him back.</p>

  <p>In the lobby, while she paused with a truly feminine instinct to tip her
  hat this way and that before the mirror, and give her hair a tentative pat or
  two at the back, the grinning face of Lite Avery in his gray Stetson appeared
  like an apparition before her eyes. She turned quickly.</p>

  <p>"Why, Lite!" she said, a little startled.</p>

  <p>"Why, Jean!" he mimicked, in the bantering voice that was like home to
  her. "Don't rush off; haven't seen you to-day. Wait till I get you a ticket,
  and then you come back and help me admire ourselves. I came down on a long
  lope when somebody said you caught a street car headed this way. Thought
  maybe I'd run across you here. Knew you couldn't stay away much longer from
  seeing how you look. Ain't too proud to sit alongside a rough-neck puncher,
  are you?"</p>

  <p>Jean looked at him understandingly. Lite's exuberance was unusual; but she
  knew, as well as though he had told her, that he had been lonesome in this
  strange city, and that he was overjoyed at the sight of her, who was his
  friend. She unpinned her hat which she had been at some pains to adjust at
  the exact angle decreed by fashion.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'll go back with you," she drawled. "I want to see how you like the
  sight of yourself just as you are. It&mdash;it's good for one, after the
  first shock wears off." She would not say a word about that Mexican picture,
  she thought; but she wanted to see if Lite also would recognize Art Osgood,
  and feel as sure of his identity as she had felt. That would make her doubly
  sure of her self. She could do what she meant to do without any misgivings
  whatsoever. She could afford to wait a little while and have the pleasure of
  Lite's presence beside her. Lite was homesick and lonesome;&mdash;she felt it
  in every tone and in every look;&mdash;almost as homesick and lonesome as she
  was herself. She would not hurt him by going off and leaving him alone, even
  if she had not wanted to be with him and to watch the effect that Mexican
  picture would have upon him. Lite believed Art Osgood was in the Klondyke.
  She would wait and see what he believed after he had seen that Nogales
  picture</p>

  <p>She waited. She had missed Lite in the last day or so; she had seemed
  almost as far away from him as from the Lazy A. But all the while she talked
  to him in whispers when he had wanted to discuss the Jean picture, she was
  waiting, just waiting, for that Nogales picture.</p>

  <p>When it came at last, Jean turned her head and watched Lite. And Lite gave
  a real start and said something under his breath, and plucked at her sleeve
  afterwards to attract her attention.</p>

  <p>"Look&mdash;quick! That fellow standing there with his arms folded. Skin
  me alive if it isn't Art Osgood!"</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?" Jean studied him.</p>

  <p>"Sure? Where're your eyes? Look at him! It sure ain't anybody else, Jean.
  Now, what do you reckon he's doing down in Mexico?"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21">XXI.&mdash; JEAN BELIEVES THAT SHE TAKES MATTERS INTO HER OWN
     HANDS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER all, Jean did not have to fight her way clear through
  "Warring Mexico" and back again, in order to reach Nogales. She let Lite take
  her to the snug little apartment which she was to share with Muriel and her
  mother, and she fancied that she had been very crafty and very natural in her
  manner all the while he was with her, and that Lite did not dream of what she
  had in her mind to do. At any rate, she watched him stalk away on his
  high-heeled riding-boots, and she thought that his mind was perfectly at
  ease. (Jean, I fear, never will understand Lite half as well as Lite has
  always understood Jean.)</p>

  <p>She caught the next down-town car and went straight to the information
  bureau of the Southern Pacific, established for the convenience of the public
  and the sanity of employees who have something to do besides answer foolish
  questions.</p>

  <p>She found a young man there who was not averse to talking at length with a
  young woman who was dressed trimly in a street suit of the latest fashion,
  and who had almost entrancing, soft drawl to her voice and a most fascinating
  way of looking at one. This young man appeared to know a great deal, and to
  be almost eager to pass along his wisdom. He knew all about Nogales, Mexico,
  for instance, and just what train would next depart in that general
  direction, and how much it would cost, and how long she would have to wait in
  Tucson for the once-a-day train to Nogales, and when she might logically
  expect to arrive in that squatty little town that might be said to be really
  and truly divided against itself. Here the nice young man became
  facetious.</p>

  <p>"Bible tells us a city divided against itself cannot stand," he informed
  Jean quite gratuitously. "Well, maybe that's straight goods, too. But Nogales
  is cut right through at the waist line with the international boundary line.
  United States customhouse on one corner of the street, Mexican customhouse in
  talking distance on the other corner. Great place for holdups, that!" This
  was a joke, and Jean smiled obligingly. "First the United States holds you
  up, and then the Mexicans. You get it coming and going. Well, Nogales don't
  have to stand. It squats. It's adobe mostly."</p>

  <p>Jean was interested, and she did not discourage the nice young man. She
  let him say all he could think of on the subject of Nogales and the Federal
  troops stationed there, and on warring Mexico generally. When she left him,
  she felt as if she knew a great deal about the end of her journey. So she
  smiled and thanked the nice young man in that soft drawl that lingered
  pleasantly in his memory, and went over to another window and bought a ticket
  to Nogales. She moved farther along to another window and secured a Pullman
  ticket which gave her lower five in car four for her comfort.</p>

  <p>With an impulse of wanting to let her Uncle Carl know that she was not
  forgetting her mission, she sent him this laconic telegram:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">HAVE LOCATED ART. WILL BRING HIM BACK WITH ME.
  JEAN.</p><br>

  <p>After that, she went home and packed a suit-case and her six-shooter and
  belt. She did not, after all, know just what might happen in Nogales, Mexico,
  but she meant to bring back Art Osgood if he were to be found alive; hence
  the six-shooter.</p>

  <p>That evening she told Muriel that she was going to run away and have her
  vacation&mdash;her "vacation" hunting down and capturing a murderer who had
  taken refuge in the Mexican army!&mdash;and that she would write when she
  knew just where she would stop. Then she went away alone in a taxi to the
  depot, and started on her journey with a six-shooter jostling a box of
  chocolates in her suit-case, and with her heart almost light again, now that
  she was at last following a clue that promised something at the other
  end.</p>

  <p>It was all just as the nice young man had told her. Jean arrived in
  Tucson, and she left on time, on the once-a-day train to Nogales.</p>

  <p>Lite also arrived in Tucson on time, though Jean did not see him, since he
  descended from the chair car with some caution just as she went into the
  depot. He did not depart on time as it happened; he was thirsty, and he went
  off to find something wetter than water to drink, and while he was gone the
  once-a-day train also went off through the desert. Lite saw the last pair of
  wheels it owned go clipping over the switch, and he stood in the middle of
  the track and swore. Then he went to the telegraph office and found out that
  a freight left for Nogales in ten minutes. He hunted up the conductor and did
  things to his bank roll, and afterwards climbed into the caboose on the
  sidetrack. Lite has been so careful to keep in the background, through all
  these chapters, that it seems a shame to tell on him now. But I am going to
  say that, little as Jean suspected it, he had been quite as interested in
  finding Art Osgood as had she herself. When he saw her pass through the gate
  to the train, in Los Angeles, that was his first intimation that she was
  going to Nogales; so he had stayed in the chair car out of sight. But it just
  shows how great minds run in the same channel; and how, without suspecting
  one another, these two started at the same time upon the same quest.</p>

  <p>Jean stared out over the barrenness that was not like the barrenness of
  Montana, and tried not to think that perhaps Art Osgood had by this time
  drifted on into obscurity. Still, if he had drifted on, surely she could
  trace him, since he had been serving on the staff of a general and should
  therefore be pretty well known. What she really hated most to think of was
  the possibility that he might have been killed. They did get killed,
  sometimes, down there where there was so much fighting going on all the
  time.</p>

  <p>When the shadows of the giant cactus stretched mutilated hands across the
  desert sand, and she believed that Nogales was near, Jean carried her
  suit-case to the cramped dressing-room and took out her six-shooter and
  buckled it around her. Then she pulled her coat down over it with a good deal
  of twisting and turning before the dirty mirror to see that it looked all
  right, and not in the least as though a perfect lady was packing a gun.</p>

  <p>She went back and dipped fastidious fingers into the box of chocolates,
  and settled herself to nibble candy and wait for what might come. She felt
  very calm and self- possessed and sure of herself. Her only fear was that Art
  Osgood might have been killed, and his lips closed for all time. So they
  rattled away through the barrenness and drew near to Nogales.</p>

  <p>Casa del Sonora, whither she went, was an old, two- story structure of the
  truly Spanish type, and it was kept by a huge, blubbery creature with piggish
  eyes and a bloated, purple countenance and the palsy. As much of him as
  appeared to be human appeared to be Irish; and Jean, after the first qualm of
  repulsion, when she faced him over the hotel register, detected a certain
  kindly solicitude in his manner, and was reassured.</p>

  <p>So far, everything had run smoothly, like a well- staged play. Absurdly
  simple, utterly devoid of any element of danger, any vexatious obstacle to
  the immediate achievement of her purpose! But Jean was not thrown off her
  guard because of the smoothness of the trail.</p>

  <p>The trip from Tucson had been terribly tiresome; she was weary in every
  fibre, it seemed to her. But for all that she intended, sometime that
  evening, to meet Art Osgood if he were in town. She intended to take him with
  her on the train that left the next morning. She thought it would be a good
  idea to rest now, and to proceed deliberately, lest she frustrate all her
  plans by over-eagerness.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she slept a little while she lay upon the bed and schooled herself
  to calmness. A band, somewhere, playing a pulsing Spanish air, brought her to
  her feet. She went to the window and looked out, and saw that the street lay
  cool and sunless with the coming of dusk.</p>

  <p>From the American customhouse just on the opposite corner came Lite Avery,
  stalking leisurely along in his high-heeled riding-boots. Jean drew back with
  a little flutter of the pulse and watched him, wondering how he came to be in
  Nogales. She had last seen him boarding a car that would take him out to the
  Great Western Studio; and now, here he was, sauntering across the street as
  if he lived here. It was like finding his bed up in the loft and knowing all
  at once that he had been keeping watch all the while, thinking of her welfare
  and never giving her the least hint of it. That at least was understandable.
  But to her there was something uncanny about his being here in Nogales. When
  he was gone, she stepped out through the open window to the veranda that ran
  the whole length of the hotel, and looked across the street into Mexico.</p>

  <p>She was, she decided critically, about fifteen feet from the boundary
  line. Just across the street fluttered the Mexican flag from the Mexican
  customhouse. A Mexican guard lounged against the wall, his swarthy face
  mask-like in its calm. While she leaned over the railing and stared curiously
  at that part of the street which was another country, from the hills away to
  the west, where were camped soldiers,&mdash;the American soldiers,&mdash;who
  prevented the war from slopping over the line now and then into Arizona, came
  the clear notes of a bugle held close-pressed against the lips of a United
  States soldier in snug-fitting khaki. The boom of the sundown salute followed
  immediately after. In the street below her, Mexicans and Americans mingled
  amiably and sauntered here and there, killing time during that bored interval
  between eating and the evening's amusement.</p>

  <p>Just beyond the Mexican boundary, the door of a long, adobe cantina was
  flung open, and a group of men came out and paused as if they were wondering
  what they should do next, and where they should go. Jean looked them over
  curiously. Mexicans they were not, though they had some of the dress which
  belonged on that side of the boundary.</p>

  <p>Americans they were; one knew by the set of their shoulders, by the little
  traits of race which have nothing to do with complexion or speech.</p>

  <p>Jean caught her breath and leaned forward. There was Art Osgood, standing
  with his back toward her and with one palm spread upon his hip in the
  attitude she knew so well. If only he would turn! Should she run down the
  stairs and go over there and march him across the line at the muzzle of her
  revolver? The idea repelled her, now that she had actually come to the point
  of action.</p>

  <p>Jean, now that the crisis had arrived, used her woman's wile, rather than
  the harsher but perhaps less effective weapons of a man.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Art!" she called, just exactly as she would have called to him on the
  range, in Montana "Hello, Art!"</p>

  <p>Art Osgood wheeled and sent a startled, seeking glance up at the veranda;
  saw her and knew who it was that had called him, and lifted his hat in the
  gesture that she knew so well. Jean's fingers were close to her gun, though
  she was not conscious of it, or of the strained, tense muscles that waited
  the next move.</p>

  <p>Art, contrary to her expectations, did the most natural thing in the
  world. He grinned and came hurrying toward her with the long, eager steps of
  one who goes to greet a friend after an absence that makes of that meeting an
  event. Jean watched him cross the street. She waited, dazed by the instant
  success of her ruse, while he disappeared under the veranda. She heard his
  feet upon the stairs. She heard him come striding down the hall to the
  glass-paneled door. She saw him coming toward her, still grinning in his joy
  at the meeting.</p>

  <p>"Jean Douglas! By all that's lucky!" he was exclaiming. "Where in the
  world did you light down from?" He came to a stop directly in front of her,
  and held out his hand in unsuspecting friendship.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22">XXII.&mdash; JEAN MEETS ONE CRISIS AND CONFRONTS
     ANOTHER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WELL, say! This is like seeing you walk out of that picture
  that's running at the Teatro Palacia. You sure are making a hit with those
  moving- pictures; made me feel like I'd met somebody from home to stroll in
  there and see you and Lite come riding up, large as life. How is Lite,
  anyway?"</p>

  <p>If Art Osgood felt any embarrassment over meeting her, he certainly gave
  no sign of it. He sat down on the railing, pushed back his hat, and looked as
  though he was preparing for a real soul-feast of reminiscent gossip. "Just
  get in?" he asked, by way of opening wider the channel of talk. He lighted a
  cigarette and flipped the match down into the street. "I've been here three
  or four months. I'm part of the Mexican revolution, though I don't reckon I
  look it. We been keeping things pretty well stirred up, down this way. You
  looking for picture dope? Lubin folks are copping all kinds of good stuff
  here. You ain't with them, are you?"</p>

  <p>Jean braced herself against slipping into easy conver- sation with this
  man who seemed so friendly and unsuspicious and so conscience-free. Killing a
  man, she thought, evidently did not seem to him a matter of any moment;
  perhaps because he had since then become a professional killer of men. After
  planning exactly how she should meet any contingency that might arise, she
  found herself baffled. She had not expected to meet this attitude. She was
  not prepared to meet it. She had taken it for granted that Art Osgood would
  shun a meeting; that she would have to force him to face her. And here he
  was, sitting on the porch rail and swinging one spurred and booted foot,
  smiling at her and talking, in high spirits over the meeting&mdash;or a
  genius at acting. She eyed him uncertainly, trying to adjust herself to this
  emergency.</p>

  <p>Art came to a pause and looked at her inquiringly. "What's the matter?" he
  demanded. "You called me up here&mdash;and I sure was tickled to death to
  come, all right!&mdash;and now you stand there looking like I was a kid that
  had been caught whispering, and must be kept after school. I know the
  symptoms, believe me! You're sore about something I've said. What, don't you
  like to have anybody talk about you being a movie- queen? You sure are all of
  that. You've got a license to be proud of yourself. Or maybe you didn't know
  you was speaking to a Mexican soldier, or something like that." He made a
  move to rise. "Ex-cuse ME, if I've said something I hadn't ought. I'll beat
  it, while the beating's good."</p>

  <p>"No, you won't. You'll stay right where you are." His frank acceptance of
  her hostile attitude steadied Jean. "Do you think I came all the way down
  here just to say hello?"</p>

  <p>"Search me." Art studied her curiously. "I never could keep track of what
  you thought and what you meant, and I guess you haven't grown any easier to
  read since I saw you last. I'll be darned if I know what you came for; but
  it's a cinch you didn't come just to be riding on the cars."</p>

  <p>"No," drawled Jean, watching him. "I didn't. I came after you."</p>

  <p>Art Osgood stared, while his cheeks darkened with the flush of confusion.
  He laughed a little. "I sure wish that was the truth," he said. "Jean, you
  never would have to go very far after any man with two eyes in his head.
  Don't rub it in."</p>

  <p>"I did," said Jean calmly. "I came after you. I'd have found you if I had
  to hunt all through Mexico and fight both armies for you."</p>

  <p>"Jean!" There was a queer, pleading note in Art's voice. "I wish I could
  believe that, but I can't. I ain't a fool."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are." Jean contradicted him pitilessly. "You were a fool when
  you thought you could go away and no one think you knew anything at all
  about&mdash; Johnny Croft."</p>

  <p>Art's fingers had been picking at a loose splinter on the wooden rail
  whereon he sat. He looked down at it, jerked it loose with a sharp twist, and
  began snapping off little bits with his thumb and forefinger. In a minute he
  looked up at Jean, and his eyes were different. They were not hostile; they
  were merely cold and watchful and questioning</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Well, somebody did think so. I've thought so for three years, and so I'm
  here." Jean found that her breath was coming fast, and that as she leaned
  back against a post and gripped the rail on either side, her arms were
  quivering like the legs of a frightened horse. Still, her voice had sounded
  calm enough.</p>

  <p>Art Osgood sat with his shoulders drooped forward a little, and
  painstakingly snipped off tiny bits of the splinter. After a short silence,
  he turned his head and looked at her again.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think you'd want to stir up that trouble after all this
  while," he said. "But women are queer. I can't see, myself, why you'd want to
  bother hunting me up on account of&mdash;that."</p>

  <p>Jean weighed his words, his look, his manner, and got no clue at all to
  what was going on back of his eyes. On the surface, he was just a tanned,
  fairly good-looking young man who has been reluctantly drawn into an
  unpleasant subject.</p>

  <p>"Well, I did consider it worth while bothering to hunt you up," she told
  him flatly. "If you don't think it's important, you at least won't object to
  going back with me?"</p>

  <p>Again his glance went to her face, plainly startled. "Go back with you?"
  he repeated. "What for?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;" Jean still had some trouble with her breath and to keep her
  quiet, smooth drawl, "let's make it a woman's reason. Because."</p>

  <p>Art's face settled to a certain hardness that still was not hostile.
  "Becauses don't go," he said. "Not with a girl like you; they might with
  some. What do you want me to go back for?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I want you to go because I want to clear things up, about Johnny
  Croft. It's time&mdash;it was cleared up."</p>

  <p>Art regarded her fixedly. "Well, I don't see yet what's back of that first
  BECAUSE," he sparred. "There's nothing I can do to clear up anything."</p>

  <p>"Art, don't lie to me about it. I know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What do you know?" Art's eyes never left her face, now. They seemed to be
  boring into her brain. Jean began to feel a certain confusion. To be sure,
  she had never had any experience whatever with fugitive murderers; but no one
  would ever expect one to act like this. A little more, she thought
  resentfully, and he would be making her feel as if she were the guilty
  person. She straightened herself and stared back at him.</p>

  <p>"I know you left because you&mdash;you didn't want to stay and
  face-things. I&mdash;I have felt as if I could kill you, almost, for what you
  have done. I&mdash;I don't see how you can SIT there and&mdash;and look at me
  that way." She stopped and braced herself. "I don't want to argue about it. I
  came here to make you go back and face things. It's&mdash;horrible&mdash;"
  She was thinking of her father then, and she could not go on.</p>

  <p>"Jean, you're all wrong. I don't know what idea you've got, but you may as
  well get one or two things straight. Maybe you do feel like killing me; but I
  don't know what for. I haven't the slightest notion of going back; there's
  nothing I could clear up, if I did go."</p>

  <p>Jean looked at him dumbly. She supposed she should have to force him to
  go, after all. Of course, you couldn't expect that a man who had committed a
  crime will admit it to the first questioner; you couldn't expect him to go
  back willingly and face the penalty. She would have to use her gun; perhaps
  even call on Lite, since Lite had followed her. She might have felt easier in
  her mind had she seen how Lite was standing just within the glass-paneled
  door behind the dimity curtain, listening to every word, and watching every
  expression on Art Osgood's face. Lite's hand, also, was close to his gun, to
  be perfectly sure of Jean's safety. But he had no intention of spoiling her
  feeling of independence if he could help it. He had lots of faith in
  Jean.</p>

  <p>"What has cropped up, anyway?" Art asked her curiously, as if he had been
  puzzling over her reasons for being there. "I thought that affair was settled
  long ago, when it happened. I thought it was all straight sailing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To send an innocent man to prison for it? Do you call that straight
  sailing?" Jean's eyes had in them now a flash of anger that steadied her.</p>

  <p>"What innocent man?" Art threw away the stub of the splinter and sat up
  straight. "I never knew any innocent man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh! You didn't know?"</p>

  <p>"All I know," said Art, with a certain swiftness of speech that was a new
  element in his manner, "I'm dead willing to tell you. I knew Johnny had been
  around knocking the outfit, and making some threats, and saying things he had
  no business to say. I never did have any use for him, just because he was so
  mouthy. I wasn't surprised to hear&mdash;how it ended up."</p>

  <p>"To hear! You weren't there, when it happened?" Jean was watching him for
  some betraying emotion, some sign that she had struck home. She got a quick,
  sharp glance from him, as if he were trying to guess just how much she
  knew.</p>

  <p>"Why should I have been there? The last time I was ever at the Lazy A," he
  stated distinctly, "was the day before I left. I didn't go any farther than
  the gate then. I had a letter for your father, and I met him at the gate and
  gave it to him."</p>

  <p>"A letter for dad?" It was not much, but it was better than nothing. Jean
  thought she might lead him on to something more.</p>

  <p>"Yes! A note, or a letter. Carl sent me over with it."</p>

  <p>"Carl? What was it about? I never heard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I never read it. Ask your dad what it was about, why don't you? I don't
  reckon it was anything particular."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it was, though." Jean was turning crafty. She would pretend to be
  interested in the letter, and trip Art somehow when he was off his guard.
  "Are you sure that it was the day before&mdash;you left?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Some high talk in the street caught his attention, and Art turned
  and looked down. Jean caught at the chance to study his averted face, but she
  could not read innocence or guilt there. Art, she decided, was not as
  transparent as she had always believed him to be. He turned back and met her
  look. "I know it was the day before. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I wondered. Dad didn't say&mdash; What did he do with it&mdash;the
  letter?"</p>

  <p>"He opened it and read it." A smile of amused understanding of her finesse
  curled Art's lips. "And he stuck it in the pocket of his chaps and went on to
  wherever he was going." His eyes challenged her impishly.</p>

  <p>"And it was from Uncle Carl, you say?"</p>

  <p>Art hesitated, and the smile left his lips. "It&mdash;it was from Carl,
  yes. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I just wondered." Jean was wondering why he had stopped smiling, all
  at once, and why he hesitated. Was he afraid he was going to contradict
  himself about the day or the errand? Or was he afraid she would ask her Uncle
  Carl, and find that there was no letter?</p>

  <p>"Why don't you ask your dad, if you are so anxious to know all about it?"
  Art demanded abruptly. "Anyway, that's the last time I was ever over
  there."</p>

  <p>"Ask dad!" Jean's anger flamed out suddenly. "Art Osgood, when I think of
  dad, I wonder why I don't shoot you! I wonder how you dare sit there and look
  me in the face. Ask dad! Dad, who is paying with his life and all that's
  worth while in life, for that murder that you deny&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What's that? Paying how?" Art leaned toward her; and now his face was
  hard and hostile, and so were his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Paying! You know how he is paying! Paying in Deer Lodge
  penitentiary&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who? YOUR FATHER?" Had Art been ready to spring at her and catch her by
  the throat, he would not have looked much different.</p>

  <p>"My father!" Jean's voice broke upon the word. "And you&mdash;" She did
  not attempt to finish the charge.</p>

  <p>Art sat looking at her with a queer intensity. "Your father!" he repeated.
  "Aleck! I never knew that, Jean. Take my word, I never knew that!" He seemed
  to be thinking pretty fast. "Where's Carl at?" he asked irrelevantly.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Carl? He's home, running both ranches. I&mdash;I never could make
  Uncle Carl see that you must have been the one."</p>

  <p>"Been the one that shot Crofty, you mean?" Art gave a short laugh. He got
  up and stood in front of her. "Thanks, awfully. Good reason why he couldn't
  see it! He knows well enough I didn't do it. He knows&mdash;who did." He bit
  his lips then, as if he feared that he had said too much.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Carl knows? Then why doesn't he tell? It wasn't dad!" Jean took a
  defiant step toward him. "Art Osgood, if you dare say it was dad,
  I&mdash;I'll kill you!"</p>

  <p>Art smiled at her with a brief lightening of his eyes. "I believe you
  would, at that," he said soberly. "But it wasn't your dad, Jean."</p>

  <p>"Who was it?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;know."</p>

  <p>"You do! You do know, Art Osgood! And you ran off; and they gave dad eight
  years&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Art spoke one word under his breath, and that word was profane. "I don't
  see how that could be," he said after a minute.</p>

  <p>Jean did not answer. She was biting her lips to keep back the tears. She
  felt that somehow she had failed; that Art Osgood was slipping through her
  fingers, in spite of the fact that he did not seem to fear her or to oppose
  her except in the final accusation. It was the lack of opposition, that lack
  of fear, that baffled her so. Art, she felt dimly, must be very sure of his
  own position; was it because he was so close to the Mexican line? Jean
  glanced desperately that way. It was very close. She could see the features
  of the Mexican soldiers lounging before the cantina over there; through the
  lighted window of the customhouse she could see a dark- faced officer bending
  over a littered desk. The guard over there spoke to a friend, and she could
  hear the words he said.</p>

  <p>Jean thought swiftly. She must not let Art Osgood go back across that
  street. She could cover him with her gun&mdash;Art knew how well she could
  use it!&mdash;and she would call for an American officer and have him
  arrested. Or, Lite was somewhere below; she would call for Lite, and he could
  go and get an officer and a warrant.</p>

  <p>"How soon you going back?" Art asked abruptly, as though he had been
  pondering a problem and had reached the solution. "I'll have to get a leave
  of absence, or go down on the books as a deserter; and I wouldn't want that.
  I can get it, all right. I'll go back with you and straighten this thing out,
  if it's the way you say it is. I sure didn't know they'd pulled your dad for
  it, Jean."</p>

  <p>This, coming so close upon the heels of her own decision, set Jean all at
  sea again. She looked at him doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"I thought you said you didn't know, and you wouldn't go back."</p>

  <p>Art grinned sardonically. "I'll lie any time to help a friend," he
  admitted frankly. "What I do draw the line at is lying to help some cowardly
  cuss double-cross a man. Your father got the double-cross; I don't stand for
  anything like that. Not a-tall!" He heaved a sigh of nervous relaxation, for
  the last half hour had been keyed rather high for them both, and pulled his
  hat down on his head.</p>

  <p>"Say, Jean! Want to go across with me and meet the general? You can make
  my talk a whole lot stronger by telling what you came for. I'll get leave,
  all right, then. And you'll know for sure that I'm playing straight. You see
  that two-story 'dobe about half-way down the block,&mdash;the one with the
  Mexican flag over it?" He pointed. "There's where he is. Want to go
  over?"</p>

  <p>"Any objections to taking me along with you?" This was Lite, coming
  nonchalantly toward them from the doorway. Lite was still perfectly willing
  to let Jean manage this affair in her own way, but that did not mean that he
  would not continue to watch over her. Lite was much like a man who lets a
  small boy believe he is driving a skittish team all alone. Jean believed that
  she was acting alone in this, as in everything else. She had yet to learn
  that Lite had for three years been always at hand, ready to take the lines if
  the team proved too fractious for her.</p>

  <p>Art turned and put out his hand. "Why, hello, Lite! Sure, you can come
  along; glad to have you." He eyed Lite questioningly. "I'll gamble you've
  heard all we've been talking about," he said. "That would be you, all right!
  So you don't need any wising up. Come on; I want to catch the chief before he
  goes off somewhere."</p>

  <p>To see the three of them go down the stairs and out upon the street and
  across it into Mexico,&mdash;which to Jean seemed very queer,&mdash;you would
  never dream of the quest that had brought them together down here on the
  border. Even Jean was smiling, in a tired, anxious way. She walked close to
  Lite and never once asked him how he came to be there, or why. She was glad
  that he was there. She was glad to shift the whole matter to his broad
  shoulders now, and let him take the lead.</p>

  <p>They had a real Mexican dinner in a queer little adobe place where Art
  advised them quite seriously never to come alone. They had thick soup with a
  strange flavor, and Art talked with the waiter in Mexican dialect that made
  Jean glad indeed to feel Lite's elbow touching hers, and to know that
  although Lite's hand rested idly on his knee, it was only one second from his
  weapon. She had no definite suspicion of Art Osgood, but all the same she was
  thankful that she was not there alone with him among all these dark, sharp-
  eyed Mexicans with their atmosphere of latent treachery.</p>

  <p>Lite ate mostly with his left hand. Jean noticed that. It was the only
  sign of watchfulness that he betrayed, unless one added the fact that he had
  chosen a seat which brought his back against an adobe wall and his face
  toward Art and the room, with Jean beside him. That might have been pure
  chance, and it might not. But Art was evidently playing fair.</p>

  <p>A little later they came back to the Casa del Sonora, and Jean went up to
  her room feeling that a great burden had been lifted from her shoulders. Lite
  and Art Osgood were out on the veranda, gossiping of the range, and in Art's
  pocket was a month's leave of absence from his duties. Once she heard Lite
  laugh, and she stood with one hand full of hairpins and the other holding the
  brush and listened, and smiled a little. It all sounded very companionable,
  very care-free,&mdash;not in the least as though they were about to clear up
  an old wrong.</p>

  <p>She got into bed and thumped the hard pillow into a little nest for her
  tired head, and listened languidly to the familiar voices that came to her
  mingled with confused noises of the street. Lite was on guard; he would not
  lose his caution just because Art seemed friendly and helpfully inclined, and
  had meant no treachery over in that queer restaurant. Lite would not be
  easily tricked. So she presently fell asleep.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23">XXIII.&mdash; A LITTLE ENLIGHTENMENT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SOMETIME in the night Jean awoke to hear footsteps in the
  corridor outside her room. She sat up with a start, and her right hand went
  groping for her gun. Just for the moment she thought that she was in her room
  at the Lazy A, and that the night-prowler had come and was beginning his
  stealthy search of the house.</p>

  <p>Then she heard some one down in the street call out a swift sentence in
  Spanish, and get a laugh for an answer. She remembered that she was in
  Nogales, within talking distance of Mexico, and that she had found Art
  Osgood, and that he did not behave like a fugitive murderer, but like a
  friend who was anxious to help free her father.</p>

  <p>The footsteps went on down the hall,&mdash;the footsteps of Lite, who had
  come and stood for a minute outside her door to make sure that all was quiet
  and that she slept. But Jean, now that she knew where she was, lay wide awake
  and thinking. Suddenly she sat up again, staring straight before her.</p>

  <p>That letter,&mdash;the letter Art had taken to her father, the letter he
  had read and put in the pocket of his chaps! Was that what the man had been
  hunting for, those nights when he had come searching in that secret, stealthy
  way? She did not remember ever having looked into the pocket of her father's
  chaps, though they had hung in her room all those three years since the
  tragedy. Pockets in chaps were not, as a general thing, much used. Men
  carried matches in them sometimes, or money. The flap over her dad's
  chap-pocket was buttoned down, and the leather was stiff; perhaps the letter
  was there yet.</p>

  <p>She got up and turned on the light, and looked at her watch. She wanted to
  start then, that instant, for Los Angeles. She wanted to take her dad's chaps
  out of her trunk where she had packed them just for the comfort of having
  them with her, and she wanted to look and see if the letter was there still.
  There was no particular reason for believing that this was of any particular
  importance, or had any bearing whatever upon the crime. But the idea was
  there, and it nagged at her.</p>

  <p>Her watch said that it was twenty-five minutes after two o'clock. The
  train, Lite had told her, would leave for Tucson at seven-forty-five in the
  morning. She told herself that, since it was too far to walk, and since she
  could not start any sooner by staying up and freezing, she might just as well
  get back into bed and try to sleep.</p>

  <p>But she could not sleep. She kept thinking of the letter, and trying to
  imagine what clue it could possibly give if she found it still in the pocket.
  Carl had sent it, Art said. A thought came to Jean which she tried to ignore;
  and because she tried to ignore it, it returned with a dogged insistence, and
  took clearer shape in her mind, and formed itself into questions which she
  was compelled at last to face and try to answer.</p>

  <p>Was it her Uncle Carl who had come and searched the house at night, trying
  to find that letter? If it were her uncle, why was he so anxious to find it,
  after three years had passed? What was in the letter? If it had any bearing
  whatever upon the death of Johnny Croft, why hadn't her dad mentioned it? Why
  hadn't her Uncle Carl said something about it? Was the letter just a note
  about some ranch business? Then why else should any one come at night and
  prowl all through the house, and never take anything? Why had he come that
  first night?</p>

  <p>Jean drew in her breath sharply. All at once, like a flashlight turned
  upon a dark corner of her mind, she remembered something about that night.
  She remembered how she had told her Uncle Carl that she meant to prove that
  her dad was innocent; that she meant to investigate the devious process by
  which the Lazy A ranch and all the stock had ceased to belong to her or her
  father; that she meant to adopt sly, sleuth-like methods; she remembered the
  very words which she had used. She remembered how bitter her uncle had
  become. Had she frightened him, somehow, with her bold declaration that she
  would not "let sleeping dogs lie" any longer? Had he remembered the letter,
  and been uneasy because of what was in it? But what COULD be in it, if it
  were written at least a day before the terrible thing had happened?</p>

  <p>She remembered her uncle's uncontrolled fury that evening when she had
  ridden over to see Lite. What had she said to cause it? She tried to recall
  her words, and finally she did remember saying something about proving that
  her own money had been paying for her "keep" for three years. Then he had
  gone into that rage, and she had not at the time seen any connection between
  her words and his raving anger. But perhaps there was a connection.
  Perhaps&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Oh, my goodness!" she exclaimed aloud. She was remembering the telegram
  which she had sent him just before she left Los Angeles for Nogales. "He'll
  just simply go WILD when he gets that wire!" She recalled now how he had
  insisted all along that Art Osgood knew absolutely nothing about the murder;
  she recalled also, with an uncanny sort of vividness, Art's manner when he
  had admitted for the second time that the letter had been from Carl. She
  remembered how he had changed when he found that her father was being
  punished for the crime.</p>

  <p>She did not know, just yet, how all these tangled facts were going to work
  out. She had not yet come to the final question that she would presently be
  asking herself. She felt sure that her uncle knew more,&mdash; a great deal
  more,&mdash;about Johnny Croft's death than he had appeared to know; but she
  had not yet reached the point to which her reasonings inevitably would bring
  her; perhaps her mind was subconsciously delaying the ultimate
  conclusion.</p>

  <p>She got up and dressed; unfastening her window, she stepped out on the
  veranda. The street was quiet at that time in the morning. A sentry stood on
  guard at the corner, and here and there a light flared in some window where
  others were wakeful. But for the most part the town lay asleep. Over in what
  was really the Mexican quarter, three or four roosters were crowing as if
  they would never leave off. The sound of them depressed Jean, and made her
  feel how heavy was the weight of her great undertaking,&mdash;heavier now,
  when the end was almost in sight, than it had seemed on that moonlight night
  when she had ridden over to the Lazy A and had not the faintest idea of how
  she was going to accomplish any part of her task which she had set herself.
  She shivered, and turned back to get the gay serape which she had bought from
  an old Mexican woman when they were coming out of that queer restaurant last
  evening.</p>

  <p>When she came out again, Lite was standing there, smoking a cigarette and
  leaning against a post.</p>

  <p>"You'd better get some sleep, Jean," he reproved her when she came and
  stood beside him. "You had a pretty hard day yesterday; and to-day won't be
  any easier. Better go back and lie down."</p>

  <p>Jean merely pulled the serape snugger about her shoulders and sat down
  sidewise upon the railing. "I couldn't sleep," she said. "If I could, I
  wouldn't be out here; I'd be asleep, wouldn't I? Why don't you go to bed
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Ah-h, Art's learned to talk Spanish," he said drily. "I got myself all
  worked up trying to make out what he was trying to say in his sleep, and then
  I found out it wasn't my kinda talk, anyway. So I quit. What's the matter
  that you can't sleep?"</p>

  <p>Jean stared down at the shadowy street. A dog ran out from somewhere,
  sniffed at a doorstep, and trotted over into Mexico and up to the sentry. The
  sentry patted it on the head and muttered a friendly word or two. Jean
  watched him absently. It was all so peaceful! Not at all what one would
  expect, after seeing pictures of all those refugees and all those soldiers
  fighting, and the dead lying in the street in some little town whose name she
  could not pronounce correctly.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear Art tell about taking a letter to dad the day before?" she
  asked abruptly. "He wasn't telling the truth, not all the time. But somehow I
  believe that was the truth. He said dad stuck it in the pocket of his chaps.
  I believe it's there yet, Lite. I don't remember ever looking into that
  pocket. And I believe&mdash;Lite, I never said anything about it, but
  somebody kept coming to the house in the night and hunting around through all
  the rooms. He never came into my room, so I&mdash;I didn't bother him; but
  I've wondered what he was after. It just occurred to me that
  maybe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I never could figure out what he was after, either," Lite observed
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"You?" Jean turned her head, so that her eyes shone in the light of a
  street lamp while she looked up at him. "How in the world did you know about
  him?"</p>

  <p>Lite laughed drily. "I don't think there's much concerns you that I don't
  know," he confessed. "I saw him, I guess, every time he came around. He
  couldn't have made a crooked move,&mdash;and got away with it. But I never
  could figure him out exactly."</p>

  <p>Jean looked at him, touched by the care of her that he had betrayed in
  those few words. Always she had accepted him as the one friend who never
  failed her, but lately,&mdash;since the advent of the motion-picture people,
  to be exact,&mdash;a new note had crept into his friendship; a new meaning
  into his watching over her. She had sensed it, but she had never faced it
  openly. She pulled her thoughts away from it now.</p>

  <p>"Did you know who he was?"</p>

  <p>It was like Jean to come straight to the point. Lite smiled faintly; he
  knew that question would come, and he knew that he would have to answer
  it.</p>

  <p>"Sure. I made it my business to know who he was."</p>

  <p>"Who was it, Lite?"</p>

  <p>Lite did not say. He knew that question was coming also, but he did not
  know whether he ought to answer it.</p>

  <p>"It was Uncle Carl, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>Lite glanced down at her quickly. "You're a good little guesser."</p>

  <p>"Then it was that letter he was after." She was silent for a minute, and
  then she looked at her watch. "And I can't get at those chaps before
  to-morrow!" She sighed and leaned back against the post.</p>

  <p>"Lite, if it was worth all that hunting for, it must mean something to us.
  I wonder what it can be; don't you know?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Lite slowly, "I don't. And it's something a man don't want to
  do any guessing about."</p>

  <p>This, Jean felt, was a gentle reproof for her own speculations upon the
  subject. She said no more about the letter.</p>

  <p>"I sent him a telegram," she informed Lite irrelevantly, "saying I'd
  located Art and was going to take him back there. I wonder what he thought
  when he got that!"</p>

  <p>Lite turned half around and stared down at her. He opened his lips to
  speak, hesitated, and closed them without making a sound. He turned away and
  stared down into the street that was so empty. After a little he glanced at
  his own watch, with the same impulse Jean had felt. The hours and minutes
  were beginning to drag their feet as they passed.</p>

  <p>"You go in," he ordered gently, "and lie down. You'll be all worn out when
  the time comes for you to get busy. We don't know what's ahead of us on this
  trail, Jean. Right now, it's peaceful as Sunday morning down in Maine; so you
  go in and get some sleep, while you have a chance, and stop thinking about
  things. Go on, Jean. I'll call you plenty early; you needn't be afraid of
  missing the train."</p>

  <p>Jean smiled a little at the tender, protective note of authority in his
  voice and manner. Whether she permitted it or not, Lite would go right on
  watching over her and taking care of her. With a sudden desire to please him,
  she rose obediently. When she passed him, she reached out and gave his arm a
  little squeeze.</p>

  <p>"You cantankerous old tyrant," she drawled in a whisper, "you do love to
  haze me around, don't you? Just to spite you, I'll do it!" She went in and
  left him standing there, smoking and leaning against the post, calm as the
  stars above. But under that surface calm, the heart of Lite Avery was
  thumping violently. His arm quivered still under the thrill of Jean's
  fingers. Your bottled-up souls are quick to sense the meaning in a tone or a
  touch; Jean, whether she herself knew it or not, had betrayed an emotion that
  set Lite's thoughts racing out into a golden future. He stood there a long
  while, staring out upon the darkness, his eyes shining.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24">XXIV.&mdash; THE LETTER IN THE CHAPS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THOUGH hours may drag themselves into the past so sluggishly
  that one is fairly maddened by the snail's pace of them, into the past they
  must go eventually. Jean had sat and listened to the wheels of the Golden
  State Limited clank over the cryptic phrase that meant so much.
  "Letter-in-the-chaps! Letter-in-the chaps!" was what they had said while the
  train pounded across the desert and slid through arroyas and deep cuts which
  leveled hills for its passing. "Letter- in-the-chaps! Letter-in-the-chaps!"
  And then a silence while they stood by some desolate station where the people
  were swarthy of skin and black of hair and eyes, and moved languidly if they
  moved at all. Then they would go on; and when the wheels had clicked over the
  switches of the various side tracks, they would take up again the refrain:
  "Letter-in-the-chaps! Letter- in-the-chaps!" until Jean thought she would go
  crazy if they kept it up much longer.</p>

  <p>Little by little they drew near to Los Angeles. And then they were there,
  sliding slowly through the yards in a drab drizzle of one of California's
  fall rains. Then they were in a taxicab, making for the Third Street tunnel.
  Then Jean stared heavy-eyed at the dripping palms along the boulevard which
  led away from the smoke of the city and into Hollywood, snuggled against the
  misty hills. "Letter-in-the-chaps!" her tired brain repeated it still.</p>

  <p>Then she was in the apartment shared with Muriel Gay and her mother. These
  two were over at the studio, the landlady told her when she let them in, and
  Jean was glad that they were gone.</p>

  <p>She knelt, still in her hat and coat and with her gloves on, and fitted
  her trunk key into the lock. And there she stopped. What if the letter were
  not in the chaps, after all? What if it were but a trivial note, concerning a
  matter long since forgotten; a trivial note that had not the remotest bearing
  upon the murder? "Letter-in-the-chaps!" The phrase returned with a mocking
  note and beat insistently through her brain. She sat back on the floor and
  shivered with the chill of a fireless room in California, when a fall rain is
  at its drizzling worst.</p>

  <p>In the next room one of the men coughed; afterwards she heard Lite's
  voice, saying something in an undertone to Art Osgood. She heard Art's voice
  mutter a reply. She raised herself again to her knees, turned the key in the
  lock, and lifted the trunk-lid with an air of determination.</p>

  <p>Down next the bottom of her big trunk they lay, just as she had packed
  them away, with her dad's six-shooter and belt carefully disposed between the
  leathern folds. She groped with her hands under a couple of riding- skirts
  and her high, laced boots, got a firm grip on the fringed leather, and
  dragged them out. She had forgotten all about the gun and belt until they
  fell with a thump on the floor. She pulled out the belt, left the gun lying
  there by the trunk, and hurried out with the chaps dangling over her arm.</p>

  <p>She was pale when she stood before the two who sat there waiting with
  their hats in their hands and their faces full of repressed eagerness. Her
  fingers trembled while she pulled at the stiff, leather flap of the pocket,
  to free it from the button.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it ain't there yet," Art hazarded nervously, while they watched
  her. "But that's where he put it, all right. I saw him."</p>

  <p>Jean's fingers went groping into the pocket, stayed there for a second or
  two, and came out holding a folded envelope.</p>

  <p>"That's it!" Art leaned toward her eagerly. "That's the one, all
  right."</p>

  <p>Jean sat down suddenly because her knees seemed to bend under her weight.
  Three years&mdash;and that letter within her reach all the time!</p>

  <p>"Let's see, Jean." Lite reached out and took it from her nerveless
  fingers. "Maybe it won't amount to anything at all."</p>

  <p>Jean tried to hold herself calm. "Read it&mdash;out loud," she said. "Then
  we'll know." She tried to smile, and made so great a failure of it that she
  came very near crying. The faint crackle of the cheap paper when Lite
  unfolded the letter made her start nervously. "Read it&mdash;no
  matter&mdash;what it is," she repeated, when she saw Lite's eyes go rapidly
  over the lines.</p>

  <p>Lite glanced at her sharply, then leaned and took her hand and held it
  close. His firm clasp steadied her more than any words could have done.
  Without further delay or attempt to palliate its grim significance, he read
  the note:</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><small>ALECK:</small></p>

  <p class="letter">If Johnny Croft comes to you with anything about me, kick
  him off the ranch. He claims he knows a whole lot about me branding too many
  calves. Don't believe anything he tells you. He's just trying to make trouble
  because he claims I underpaid him. He was telling Art a lot of stuff that he
  claimed he could prove on me, but it's all a lie. Send him to me if he comes
  looking for trouble. I'll give him all he wants.</p>

  <p class="letter">Art found a heifer down in the breaks that looks like she
  might have blackleg. I'm going down there to see about it. Maybe you better
  ride over and see what you think about it; we don't want to let anything like
  that get a start on us.</p>

  <p class="letter">Don't pay any attention to Johnny. I'll fix him if he don't
  keep his face shut.</p>

  <p class="letter"><small>CARL</small>.</p><br>

  <p>"Carl!" Jean repeated the name mechanically. "Carl."</p>

  <p>"I kinda thought it was something like that," Art Osgood interrupted her
  to say. "Now you know that much, and I'll tell you just what I know about it.
  It was Carl shot Crofty, all right. I rode over with him to the Lazy A; I was
  on my way to town and we went that far together. I rode that way to tell you
  good-by." He looked at Jean with a certain diffidence. "I kinda wanted to see
  you before I went clear outa the country, but you weren't at home.</p>

  <p>"Johnny Croft's horse was standing outside the house when we rode up. I
  guess he must have just got there ahead of us. Carl got off and went in ahead
  of me. Johnny was eating a snack when I went in. He said something to Carl,
  and Carl flared up. I saw there wasn't anybody at home, and I didn't want to
  get mixed up in the argument, so I turned and went on out. And I hadn't more
  than got to my horse when I heard a shot, and Carl came running out with his
  gun in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Well, Johnny was dead, and there wasn't anything I could do about it.
  Carl told me to beat it outa the country, just like I'd been planning; he
  said it would be a whole lot better for him, seeing I wasn't an eye- witness.
  He said Johnny started to draw his gun, and he shot in self-defense; and he
  said I better go while the going was good, or I might get pulled into it some
  way.</p>

  <p>"Well, I thought it over for a minute, and I didn't see where it would get
  me anything to stay. I couldn't help Carl any by staying, because I wasn't in
  the house when it happened. So I hit the trail for town, and never said
  anything to anybody." He looked at the two contritely. "I never knew, till
  you folks came to Nogales looking for me, that things panned out the way they
  did. I thought Carl was going to give himself up, and would be cleared. I
  never once dreamed he was the kinda mark that would let his own brother take
  the blame that way."</p>

  <p>"I guess nobody did." Lite folded the letter and pushed it back into the
  envelope. "I can look back now, though, and see how it come about. He hung
  back till Aleck found the body and was arrested; and after that he just
  simply didn't have the nerve to step out and say that he was the one that did
  it. He tried hard to save Aleck, but he wouldn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The coward! The low, mean coward!" Jean stood up and looked from one to
  the other, and spoke through her clinched teeth. "To let dad suffer all this
  while! Lite, when did you say that train left for Salt Lake? We can take the
  taxi back down town, and save time." She was at the door when she turned
  toward the two again. "Hurry up! Don't you know we've got to hurry? Dad's in
  prison all this while! And Uncle Carl,&mdash;there's no telling where Uncle
  Carl is! That wire I sent him was the worst thing I could have done!"</p>

  <p>"Or the best," suggested Lite laconically, as he led the way down the hall
  and out to the rain-drenched, waiting taxicab.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25">XXV.&mdash; LITE COMES OUT OF THE BACKGROUND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR hours Jean had sat staring out at the drear stretches of
  desert dripping under the dismal rain that streaked the car windows. The
  clouds hung leaden and gray close over the earth; the smoke from the engine
  trailed a funereal plume across the grease-wood covered plain. Away in the
  distance a low line of hills stretched vaguely, as though they were placed
  there to hold up the sky that was so heavy and dank. Alongside the track
  every ditch ran full of clay-colored water that wrapped little, ragged
  wreaths of dirty foam around every obstruction, like the tawdry finery of the
  slums.</p>

  <p>From the smoking-room where he had been for the past two hours with Art
  Osgood, Lite came unsteadily down the aisle, heralded as it were by the
  muffled scream of the whistle at a country crossing. Jean turned toward him a
  face as depressed as the desert out there under the rain. Lite, looking at
  her keenly, saw on her cheeks the traces of tears. He let himself down
  wearily into the seat beside her, reached over calmly, and took her hand from
  off her lap and held it snugly in his own.</p>

  <p>"This is likely a snowstorm, up home," he said in his quiet,
  matter-of-fact way. "I guess we'll have to make our headquarters in town till
  I get things hauled out to the ranch. That's it, when you can't look ahead
  and see what's coming. I could have had everything ready to go right on out,
  only I thought there wouldn't be any use, before spring, anyway. But if this
  storm ain't a blizzard up there, a couple of days will straighten things
  out."</p>

  <p>Jean turned her head and regarded him attentively. "Out where?" she asked
  him bluntly. "What are you talking about? Have you and Art been celebrating?"
  She knew better than that. Lite never indulged in liquid celebrations, and
  Jean knew it.</p>

  <p>Lite reached into his pocket with the hand that was free, and drew forth a
  telegram envelope. He released her hand while he drew out the message, but he
  did not hand it to her immediately. "I wired Rossman from Los Angeles," he
  informed her, "and told him what was up, and asked him to put me up to date
  on that end of the line. So he did. I got this back there at that last town."
  He laid his hand over hers again, and looked down at her sidelong.</p>

  <p>"Ever since the trouble," he began abruptly, but still in that quiet,
  matter-of-fact way, "I've been playing a lone hand and kinda holding back and
  waiting for something to drop. I had that idea all along that you've had this
  summer: getting hold of the Lazy A and fixing it up so your dad would have a
  place to come back to. I never said anything, because talking don't come
  natural to me like it does to some, and I'd rather do a thing first and then
  talk about it afterwards if I have to.</p>

  <p>"So I hung on to what money I had saved up along; I was going to get me a
  bunch of cattle and fix up that homestead of mine some day, and maybe have a
  little home." His eyes went surreptitiously to her face, and lingered there
  wistfully. "So after the trouble I buckled down to work and saved a little
  faster, if anything. It looked to me like there wasn't much hope of doing
  anything for your dad till his sentence ran out, so I never said anything
  about it. Long as Carl didn't try to sell it to anybody else, I just waited
  and got together all the money I could. I didn't see as there was anything
  else to do."</p>

  <p>Jean was chewing a corner of her lip, and was staring out of the window.
  "I didn't know I was stealing your thunder, Lite," she said dispiritedly.
  "Why didn't you tell me?"</p>

  <p>`Wasn't anything to tell&mdash;till there was something to tell. Now, this
  telegram here,&mdash;this is what I started out to talk about. It'll be just
  as well if you know it before we get to Helena. I showed it to Art, and he
  thought the same as I did. You know,&mdash;or I reckon you don't, because I
  never said anything,&mdash; away last summer, along about the time you went
  to work for Burns, I got to thinking things over, and I wondered if Carl
  didn't have something on his mind about that killing. So I wrote to Rossman.
  I didn't much like the way he handled your dad's case, but he knew all the
  ins and outs, so I could talk to him without going away back at the
  beginning. He knew Carl, too, so that made it easier.</p>

  <p>"I wrote and told him how Carl was prowling around through the house
  nights, and the like of that, and to look up the title to the Lazy
  A&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why wouldn't you wait and let me buy it myself?" Jean asked him with just
  a shade of sharpness in her voice. "You knew I wanted to."</p>

  <p>"So I got Rossman started, quite a while back. He thought as I did, that
  Carl was acting mighty funny. I was with Carl more than you was, and I could
  tell he had something laying heavy on his mind. But then, the rest of us had
  things laying pretty heavy on our minds, too, that wasn't guilt; so there
  wasn't any way to tell what was bothering Carl." Lite made no attempt to
  answer the question she had asked.</p>

  <p>"Now, here's this wire Rossman sent me. You don't want to get the wrong
  idea, Jean, and feel too bad about this. You don't want to think you had
  anything to do with it. Carl was gradually building up to something of this
  kind,&mdash;has been for a long time. His coming over to the ranch nights,
  looking for that letter that he had hunted all over for at first, shows he
  wasn't right in his mind on the subject. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, heavens and earth, Lite!" Jean's tone was exasperated more than it
  was worried. "Why don't you say what you want to say? What's it all about?
  Let me read that telegram and be done with it. I&mdash;I should think you'd
  know I can stand things, by this time. I haven't shown any weak knees, have
  I?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I hate to pile on any more," Lite muttered defensively. "But you've
  got to know this. I wish you didn't, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jean did not say any more. She reached over and with her free hand took
  the telegram from him. She did not pull away the hand Lite was holding,
  however, and the heart of him gave an exultant bound because she let it lie
  there quiet under his own. She pinched her brows together over the message,
  and let it drop into her lap. Her head went back against the towel covered
  head-rest, and for a minute her eyes closed as if she could not look any
  longer upon trouble.</p>

  <p>Lite waited a second, pulled her head over against his shoulder, and
  picked up the telegram and read it through slowly, though he could have
  repeated it word for word with his eyes shut.</p><br>

  CONFESSING MURDER OF CROFT. HAD JUST COMPLETED TRANSFER OF LAND AND CATTLE TO
  YOUR NAME. AM TAKING STEPS PLACING MATTER BEFORE GOVERNOR IMMEDIATELY EXPECT
  HIM TO ACT AT ONCE UPON PARDON. BRING YOUR MAN MY OFFICE AT ONCE DEPOSITION
  MAY BE REQUIRED. J.W. ROSSMAN.</p><br>

  <p>"Now, I told you not to worry about this," Lite reminded the girl firmly.
  "Looks to me like it takes a load off our hands,&mdash;Carl's doing what he
  done. Saves us dragging it all through court again; and, Jean, it'll let your
  dad out a whole lot quicker. Sounds kinda cold-blooded, maybe, but if you
  could look at it as good news,&mdash;that's the way it strikes me."</p>

  <p>Jean did not say a word, just then. She did what you might not expect Jean
  to do, after all her strong- mindedness and her independence: She made an
  uncertain movement toward sitting up and facing things calmly, man-fashion;
  then she leaned and dropped her very independent brown head back upon Lite's
  shoulder, and behind her handkerchief she cried quietly while Lite held her
  close.</p>

  <p>"Now, that's long enough to cry," he whispered to her, after a season of
  mental intoxication such as he had never before experienced. "I started out
  three years ago to be the boss. I ain't been working at it regular, as you
  might say, all the time. But I'm going to wind up that way. I hate to turn
  you over to your dad without some little show of making good at the job."</p>

  <p>Jean gave a little gurgle that may have been related to laughter, and
  Lite's lips quirked with humorous embarrassment as he went on.</p>

  <p>"I don't guess," he said slowly, "that I'm going to turn you over at all,
  Jean. Not altogether. I guess I've just about got to keep you. It&mdash;takes
  two to make a home, and&mdash;I've got my heart set on us making a home outa
  the Lazy A again; you and me, making a home for us and your dad.
  How&mdash;how does that sound to you, Jean?"</p>

  <p>Jean was wiping her eyes as unobtrusively as she might. She did not
  answer.</p>

  <p>"How does it sound, you and me making a home together?" Lite was growing
  pale, and his hands trembled. "Tell me."</p>

  <p>"It sounds&mdash;good," said Jean unsteadily.</p>

  <p>For several minutes Lite did not say a word. They sat there holding hands
  quite foolishly, and stared out at the drenched desert.</p>

  <p>"Soon as your dad comes," he said at last, very simply, "we'll be
  married." He was silent another minute, and added under his breath like a
  prayer, "And we'll all go&mdash;home."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26">XXVI.&mdash; HOW HAPPINESS RETURNED TO THE LAZY A</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Lite rapped with his knuckles on the door of the room
  where she was waiting, Jean stood with her hands pressed tightly over her
  face, every muscle rigid with the restraint she was putting upon herself. For
  Lite this three-day interval had been too full of going here and there,
  attending to the manifold details of untangling the various threads of their
  broken life-pattern, for him to feel the suspense which Jean had suffered.
  She had not done much. She had waited. And now, with Lite and her dad
  standing outside the door, she almost dreaded the meeting. But she took a
  deep breath and walked to the door and opened it.</p>

  <p>"Hello, dad," she cried with a nervous gaiety. "Give your dear daughter a
  kiss!" She had not meant to say that at all.</p>

  <p>Tall and gaunt and gray and old; lines etched deep ground his bitter
  mouth; pale with the tragic prison pallor; looking out at the world with the
  somber eyes of one who has suffered most cruelly,&mdash;Aleck Douglas put out
  his thin, shaking arms and held her close. He did not say anything at all;
  and the kiss she asked for he laid softly upon her hair.</p>

  <p>Lite stood in the doorway and looked at the two of them for a moment. "I'm
  going down to see about&mdash; things. I'll be back in a little while. And,
  Jean, will you be ready?"</p>

  <p>Jean looked up at him understandingly, and with a certain shyness in her
  eyes. "If it's all right with dad," she told him, "I'll be ready."</p>

  <p>"Lite's a man!" Aleck stated unsmilingly, with a trace of that apathy
  which had hurt Jean so in the warden's office. "I'm glad you'll have him to
  take care of you, Jean."</p>

  <p>So Lite closed the door softly and went away and left those two alone.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">IN a very few words I can tell you the rest. There were a
  few things to adjust, and a few arrangements to make. The greatest
  adjustment, perhaps, was when Jean begged off from that contract with the
  Great Western Company. Dewitt did not want to let her go, but he had read a
  marked article in a Montana paper that Lite mailed to him in advance of their
  return, and he realized that some things are greater even than the needs of a
  motion-picture company. He was very nice, therefore, to Jean. He told her by
  all means to consider herself free to give her time wholly to her
  father&mdash;and her husband. He also congratulated Lite in terms that made
  Jean blush and beat a hurried retreat from his office, and that made Lite
  grin all the way to the hotel. So the public lost Jean of the Lazy A almost
  as soon as it had learned to welcome her.</p>

  <p>Then there was Pard, that had to leave the little buckskin and take that
  nerve-racking trip back to the Lazy A. Lite attended to that with perfect
  calm and a good deal of inner elation. So that detail was soon adjusted.</p>

  <p>At the Lazy A there was a great deal to do before the traces of its
  tragedy were wiped out. We'll have to leave them doing that work, which was
  only a matter of time, after all, and not nearly so hard to accomplish as
  their attempts to wipe out from Aleck's soul the black scar of those three
  years. I think, on the whole, we shall leave them doing that work, too. As
  much as human love and happiness could do toward wiping out the bitterness
  they would accomplish, you may be sure,&mdash;give them time enough.</p>
