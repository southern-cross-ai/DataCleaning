<p> </p>

<p class="l">"YES! I'm better, and the doctor tells me I've escaped
once more&mdash;as if I cared! . . . And all through the fever you came
every day to see me, so my niece says, and brought me the cool drink
that drove the heat away and gave me sleep. You thought, I suppose,
like the doctor, that I'd escape you, too. Ha! ha! And that you'd never
hear old Montes tell what he knows of bull-fighting and you don't. . .
. Or perhaps it was kindness; though, why you, a foreigner and a
heretic, should be kind to me, God knows. . . . The doctor says I've
not got much more life in me, and you're going to leave Spain within
the week&mdash;within the week, you said, didn't you? . . . Well, then,
I don't mind telling you the story.</p>

<p>"Thirty years ago I wanted to tell it often enough, but I knew no
one I could trust. After that fit passed, I said to myself I'd never
tell it; but as you're going away, I'll tell it to you, if you swear by
the Virgin you'll never tell it to any one, at least until I'm dead.
You'll swear, will you? easily enough! they all will; but as you're
going away, it's much the same. Besides, you can do nothing now; no one
can do anything; they never could have done anything. Why, they
wouldn't believe you if you told it to them, the fools! . . . My story
will teach you more aboutbull-fighting than Frascuelo or Mazzantini,
or&mdash;yes, Lagartijo knows. Weren't there Frascuelos and Mazzantinis
in my day? Dozens of them. You could pick one Frascuelo out of every
thousand labourers if you gave him the training and the practice, and
could keep him away from wine and women. But a Montes is not to be
found every day, if you searched all Spain for one. . . . 'What's the
good of bragging? I never bragged when I was at work: the deed
talks&mdash;louder than any words. Yet I think, no one has ever done
the things I used to do; for I read in a paper once an account of a
thing I often did, and the writer said 'twas incredible. Ha, ha!
incredible to the Frascuelos and Mazzantinis and the rest, who can kill
bulls and are called <i>espadas</i>. Oh, yes! bulls so tired out they
can't lift their heads. You didn't guess when you were telling me about
Frascuelo and Mazzantini that I knew them. I knew all about both of
them before you told me. I know their work, though I've not been within
sight of a ring for more than thirty years. . . . Well, I'll tell you
my story: I'll tell you my story&mdash;if I can."</p>

<p>The old man said the last words as if to himself in a low voice,
then sank back in the armchair, and for a time was silent.</p>

<p>Let me say a word or two about myself and the circumstances which
led me to seek out Montes.</p>

<p>I had been in Spain off and on a good deal, and from the first had
taken a great liking to the people and country; and no one can love
Spain and the Spaniards without becoming interested in
thebull-ring&mdash;the sport is so characteristic of the people, and in
itself so enthralling. I set myself to study it in earnest, and when I
came to know the best bull-fighters, Frascuelo, Mazzantini, and
Lagartijo, and heard them talk of their trade, I began to understand
what skill and courage, what qualities of eye and hand and heart, this
game demands. Through my love of the sport, I came to hear of Montes.
He had left so great a name that thirty years after he had disappeared
from the scene of his triumphs, he was still spoken of not
infrequently. He would perhaps have been better remembered, had the
feats attributed to him been less astounding. It was Frascuelo who told
me that Montes was still alive:</p>

<p>"Montes," he cried out in answer to me; "I can tell you about
Montes. You mean the old <i>espada</i> who, they say, used to kill the
bull in its first rush into the ring&mdash;as if any one could do that!
I can tell you about him. He must have been clever; for an old
<i>aficionado</i> I know, swears no one of us is fit to be in his
<i>cuadrilla</i>. Those old fellows are all like that, and I don't
believe half they tell about Montes. I dare say he was good enough in
his day, but there are just as good men now as ever there were. When I
was in Ronda, four years ago, I went to see Montes. He lives out of the
town in a nice, little house all alone, with one woman to attend to
him, a niece of his, they say. You know he was born in Ronda; but he
would not talk to me; he only looked at me and laughed&mdash;the
little, lame, conceited one!"</p>

<p>"You don't believe then, in spite of what theysay, that he was
better than Lagartijo or Mazzantini," I asked.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," Frascuelo replied. "Of course, he may have known more
than they do; that wouldn't be difficult, for neither of them knows
much. Mazzantini is a good <i>matador</i> because he's very tall and
strong&mdash;that's his advantage. For that, too, the women like him,
and when he makes a mistake and has to try again, he gets forgiven. It
wasn't so when I began. There were <i>aficionados</i> then, and if you
made a mistake they began to jeer, and you were soon pelted out of the
ring. Now the crowd knows nothing and is no longer content to follow
those who do know. Lagartijo? Oh! he's very quick and daring, and the
women and boys like that, too. But he's ignorant: he knows nothing
about a bull. Why, he's been wounded oftener in his five years than I
in my twenty. And that's a pretty good test. Montes must have been
clever; for he's very small and I shouldn't think he was ever very
strong, and then he was lame almost from the beginning, I've heard.
I've no doubt he could teach the business to Mazzantini or Lagartijo,
but that's not saying much. . . . He must have made a lot of money,
too, to be able to live on it ever since. And they didn't pay as high
then or even when I began as they do now."</p>

<p>So much I knew about Montes when, in the spring of 188-, I rode from
Seville to Ronda, fell in love with the place at first sight, and
resolved to stop at Polos' inn for some time. Ronda is built, so to
speak, upon an island tableland highabove the sea-level, and is ringed
about by still higher mountain ranges. It is one of the most peculiar
and picturesque places in the world. A river runs almost all round it;
and the sheer cliffs fall in many places three or four hundred feet,
from the tableland to the water, like a wall. No wonder that the Moors
held Ronda after they had lost every other foot of ground in Spain.
Taking Ronda as my headquarters I made almost daily excursions, chiefly
on foot, into the surrounding mountains. On one of these I heard again
of Montes. A peasant with whom I had been talking and who was showing
me a short cut back to the town, suddenly stopped and said, pointing to
a little hut perched on the mountain-shoulder in front of us, "From
that house you can see Ronda. That's the house where Montes, the great
<i>matador</i>, was born," he added, evidently with some pride. Then
and there the conversation with Frascuelo came back to my memory, and I
made up my mind to find Montes out and have a talk with him. I went to
his house, which lay just outside the town, next day with the
<i>alcalde</i>, who introduced me to him and then left us. The first
sight of the man interested me. He was short&mdash;about five feet
three or four, I should think&mdash;of well-knit, muscular frame. He
seemed to me to have Moorish blood in him. His complexion was very dark
and tanned; the features clean-cut; the nose sharp and inquisitive; the
nostrils astonishingly mobile; the chin and jaws square,
boney&mdash;resolute. His hair and thick moustache were snowwhite, and
this, together with the deep wrinkles on the forehead andround the eyes
and mouth, gave him an appearance of great age. He seemed to move, too,
with extreme difficulty, his lameness, as he afterwards told me, being
complicated with rheumatism. But when one looked at his eyes, the
appearance of age vanished. They were large and brown, usually
inexpressive, or rather impenetrable, brooding wells of unknown depths.
But when anything excited him, the eyes would suddenly flash to life
and become intensely luminous. The effect was startling. It seemed as
if all the vast vitality of the man had been transmuted into those
wonderful gleaming orbs: they radiated courage, energy, intellect. Then
as his mood changed, the light would die out of the eyes, and the old,
wizened, wrinkled face would settle down into its ordinary,
ill-tempered, wearied expression. There was evidently so much in the
man&mdash;courage, melancholy, keen intelligence&mdash;that in spite of
an anything but flattering reception I returned again and again to the
house. One day his niece told me that Montes was in bed, and from her
description I inferred that he was suffering from an attack of malarial
fever. The doctor who attended him, and whom I knew, confirmed this.
Naturally enough I did what I could for the sufferer, and so it came
about that after his recovery he received me with kindness, and at last
made up his mind to tell me the story of his life.</p>

<p>"I may as well begin at the beginning," Montes went on. "I was born
near here about sixty years ago. You thought I was older. Don't deny
it. I saw the surprise in your face. But it's true:in fact, I am not
yet, I think, quite sixty. My father was a peasant with a few acres of
land of his own and a cottage."</p>

<p>"I know it," I said. "I saw it the other day."</p>

<p>"Then you may have seen on the further side of the hill the
pasture-ground for cattle which was my father's chief possession. It
was good pasture; very good. . . . My mother was of a better class than
my father; she was the daughter of the chemist in Ronda; she could read
and write, and she did read, I remember, whenever she could get the
chance, which wasn't often, with her four children to take care
of&mdash;three girls and a boy&mdash;and the house to look after. We
all loved her, she was so gentle; besides, she told us wonderful
stories; but I think I was her favourite. You see I was the youngest
and a boy, and women are like that. My father was hard&mdash;at least,
I thought him so, and feared rather than loved him; but the girls got
on better with him. He never talked to me as he did to them. My mother
wanted me to go to school and become a priest; she had taught me to
read and write by the time I was six. But my father would not hear of
it. 'If you had had three boys and one girl,' I remember him saying to
her once, 'you could have done what you liked with this one. But as
there is only one boy, he must work and help me.' So by the time I was
nine I used to go off down to the pasture and watch the bulls all day
long. For though the herd was a small one&mdash;only about twenty
head&mdash;it required to be constantly watched. The cows wereattended
to in an enclosure close to the house. It was my task to mind the bulls
in the lower pasture. Of course I had a pony, for such bulls in Spain
are seldom approached, and cannot be driven by a man on foot. I see you
don't understand. But it's simple enough. My father's bulls were of
good stock, savage and strong; they were always taken for the ring, and
he got high prices for them. He generally managed to sell three
novillos and two bulls of four years old each year. And there was no
bargaining, no trouble; the money was always ready for that class of
animal. All day long I sat on my pony, or stood near it, minding the
bulls. If any of them strayed too far, I had to go and get him back
again. But in the heat of the day they never moved about much, and that
time I turned to use by learning the lessons my mother gave me. So a
couple of years passed. Of course in that time I got to know our bulls
pretty well; but it was a remark of my father which first taught me
that each bull had an individual character and first set me to watch
them closely. I must have been then about twelve years old; and in that
summer I learned more than in the two previous years. My father, though
he said nothing to me, must have noticed that I had gained confidence
in dealing with the bulls; for one night, when I was in bed, I heard
him say to my mother&mdash;'The little fellow is as good as a man now.'
I was proud of his praise, and from that time on, I set to work to
learn everything I could about the bulls.</p>

<p>"By degrees I came to know every one of them&mdash;better far than I
ever got to know men or women later. Bulls, I found, were just like
men, only simpler and kinder; some were good-tempered and honest,
others were sulky and cunning. There was a black one which was wild and
hot-tempered, but at bottom good, while there was one almost as black,
with light horns and flanks, which I never trusted. The other bulls
didn't like him. I could see they didn't; they were all afraid of him.
He was cunning and suspicious, and never made friends with any of them;
he would always eat by himself far away from the others&mdash;but he
had courage, too; I knew that as well as they did. He was sold that
very summer with the black one for the ring in Ronda. One Sunday night,
when my father and eldest sister (my mother would never go to <i>los
toros</i>) came back from seeing the game in Ronda, they were wild with
excitement, and began to tell the mother how one of our bulls had
caught the <i>matador</i> and tossed him, and how the <i>chulos</i>
could scarcely get the <i>matador</i> away. Then I cried out&mdash;'I
know; 'twas Judas' (so I had christened him), and as I saw my father's
look of surprise I went on confusedly, 'the bull with the white horns I
mean. Juan, the black one, wouldn't have been clever enough.' My father
only said, 'The boy's right'; but my mother drew me to her and kissed
me, as if she were afraid. . . . Poor mother! I think even then she
knew or divined something of what came to pass later. . . .</p>

<p>"It was the next summer, I think, that my father first found out how
much I knew about the bulls. It happened in this way. There hadn'tbeen
much rain in the spring, the pasture, therefore, was thin, and that, of
course, made the bulls restless. In the summer the weather was
unsettled&mdash;spells of heat and then thunderstorms&mdash;till the
animals became very excitable. One day, there was thunder in the air I
remember, they gave me a great deal of trouble and that annoyed me, for
I wanted to read. I had got to a very interesting tale in the
story-book my mother had given me on the day our bulls were sold. The
story was about Cervantes&mdash;ah, you know who I mean, the great
writer. Well, he was a great man, too. The story told how he escaped
from the prison over there in Algiers and got back to Cadiz, and how a
widow came to him to find out if he knew her son, who was also a slave
of the Moors. And when she heard that Cervantes had seen her son
working in chains, she bemoaned her wretchedness and ill-fortune, till
the heart of the great man melted with pity, and he said to her, 'Come,
mother, be hopeful, in one month your son shall be here with you.' And
then the book told how Cervantes went back to slavery, and how glad the
Bey was to get him again, for he was very clever; and how he asked the
Bey, as he had returned of his free will, to send the widow's son home
in his stead; and the Bey consented. That Cervantes was a man! . . .
Well, I was reading the story, and I believed every word of it, as I do
still, for no ordinary person could invent that sort of tale; and I
grew very much excited and wanted to know all about Cervantes. But as I
could only read slowly and with difficulty, I was afraid the sun would
go downbefore I could get to the end. While I was reading as hard as
ever I could, my father came down on foot and caught me. He hated to
see me reading&mdash;I don't know why; and he was angry and struck at
me. As I avoided the blow and got away from him, he pulled up the
picket line, and got on my pony to drive one of the bulls back to the
herd. I have thought since, he must have been very much annoyed before
he came down and caught me. For though he knew a good deal about bulls,
he didn't show it then. My pony was too weak to carry him easily, yet
he acted as if he had been well mounted. For as I said, the bulls were
hungry and excited, and my father should have seen this and driven the
bull back quietly and with great patience. But no; he wouldn't let him
feed even for a moment. At last the bull turned on him. My father held
the goad fairly against his neck, but the bull came on just the same,
and the pony could scarcely get out of the way in time. In a moment the
bull turned and prepared to rush at him again. My father sat still on
the little pony and held the goad; but I knew that was no use; he knew
it too; but he was angry and wouldn't give in. At once I ran in between
him and the bull, and then called to the bull, and went slowly up to
him where he was shaking his head and pawing the ground. He was very
angry, but he knew the difference between us quite well, and he let me
come close to him without rushing at me, and then just shook his head
to show me he was still angry, and soon began to feed quietly. In a
moment or two I left him and went back to myfather. He had got off the
pony and was white and trembling, and he said,</p>

<p>"'Are you hurt?'</p>

<p>"And I said laughing, 'No: he didn't want to hurt me. He was only
showing off his temper.'</p>

<p>"And my father said, 'There's not a man in all Spain that could have
done that! You know more than I do&mdash;more than anybody.'</p>

<p>"After that he let me do as I liked, and the next two years were
very happy ones. First came the marriage of my second sister; then the
eldest one was married, and they were both good matches. And the bulls
sold well, and my father had less to do, as I could attend to the whole
herd by myself. Those were two good years. My mother seemed to love me
more and more every day, or I suppose I noticed it more, and she
praised me for doing the lessons she gave me; and I had more and more
time to study as the herd got to know me better and better.</p>

<p>"My only trouble was that I had never seen the bulls in the ring.
But when I found my father was willing to take me, and 'twas mother who
wanted me not to go, I put up with that, too, and said nothing, for I
loved her greatly. Then of a sudden came the sorrow. It was in the late
winter, just before my fifteenth birthday. I was born in March, I
think. In January my mother caught cold, and as she grew worse my
father fetched the doctor, and then her father and mother came to see
her, but nothing did any good. In April she died. I wanted to die
too.</p>

<p>"After her death my father took to grumblingabout the food and house
and everything. Nothing my sister could do was right. I believe she
only married in the summer because she couldn't stand his constant
blame. At any rate she married badly, a good-for-nothing who had twice
her years, and who ill-treated her continually. A month or two later my
father, who must have been fifty, married again, a young woman, a
labourer's daughter without a <i>duro</i>. He told me he was going to
do it, for the house needed a woman. I suppose he was right. But I was
too young then to take such things into consideration, and I had loved
my mother. When I saw his new wife I did not like her, and we did not
get on well together.</p>

<p>"Before this, however, early in the summer that followed the death
of my mother, I went for the first time to see a bull-fight. My father
wanted me to go, and my sister, too; so I went. I shall never forget
that day. The <i>chulos</i> made me laugh, they skipped about so and
took such extra-good care of themselves; but the <i>banderilleros</i>
interested me. Their work required skill and courage, that I saw at
once; but after they had planted the <i>banderillas</i> twice, I knew
how it was done, and felt I could do it just as well or better. For the
third or fourth <i>banderillero</i> made a mistake! He didn't even know
with which horn the bull was going to strike; so he got frightened, and
did not plant the <i>banderillas</i> fairly&mdash;in fact, one was on
the side of the shoulder and the other didn't even stick in. As for the
<i>picadores</i>, they didn't interest me at all. There was no skill or
knowledge intheir work. It was for the crowd, who liked to see blood
and who understand nothing. Then came the turn of the <i>espada</i>.
Ah! that seemed splendid to me. He knew his work I thought at first,
and his work evidently required knowledge, skill, courage,
strength&mdash;everything. I was intensely excited, and when the bull,
struck to the heart, fell prone on his knees, and the blood gushed from
his nose and mouth, I cheered and cheered till I was hoarse. But before
the games were over, that very first day, I saw more than one
<i>matador</i> make a mistake. At first I thought I must be wrong, but
soon the event showed I was right. For the <i>matador</i> hadn't even
got the bull to stand square when he tried his stroke and failed. You
don't know what that means&mdash;'to stand square.'"</p>

<p>"I do partly," I replied, "but I don't see the reason of it. Will
you explain?"</p>

<p>"It's very simple," Montes answered. "So long as the bull's standing
with one hoof in front of the other, his shoulder-blades almost meet,
just as when you throw your arms back and your chest out; they don't
meet, of course, but the space between them is not as regular, and,
therefore, not as large as it is when their front hooves are square.
The space between the shoulder-blades is none too large at any time,
for you have to strike with force to drive the sword through the
inch-thick hide, and through a foot of muscle, sinew, and flesh besides
to the heart. Nor is the stroke a straight one. Then, too, there's
always the backbone to avoid. And the space between the backbone and
the nearest thick gristle of the shoulder-blade isnever more than an
inch and a half. So if you narrow this space by even half an inch you
increase your difficulty immensely. And that's not your object. Well,
all this I've been telling you, I divined at once. Therefore, when I
saw the bull wasn't standing quite square I knew the <i>matador</i> was
either a bungler or else very clever and strong indeed. In a moment he
proved himself to be a bungler, for his sword turned on the
shoulder-blade, and the bull, throwing up his head, almost caught him
on his horns. Then I hissed and cried, 'Shame!' And the people stared
at me. That butcher tried five times before he killed the bull, and at
last even the most ignorant of the spectators knew I had been right in
hissing him. He was one of your Mazzantinis, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" I replied, "I've seen Mazzantini try twice, but never five
times. That's too much!"</p>

<p>"Well," Montes continued quietly, "the man who tries once and fails
ought never to be allowed in a ring again. But to go on. That first day
taught me I could be an <i>espada</i>. The only doubt in my mind was in
regard to the nature of the bulls. Should I be able to understand new
bulls&mdash;bulls, too, from different herds and of different race, as
well as I understood our bulls? Going home that evening I tried to talk
to my father, but he thought the sport had been very good, and when I
wanted to show him the mistakes the <i>matadores</i> had made, he
laughed at me, and, taking hold of my arm, he said, 'Here's where you
need the gristle before you could kill a bull with a sword, even if he
were tied for you.' My father was veryproud of his size and strength,
but what he said had reason in it, and made me doubt myself. Then he
talked about the gains of the <i>matadores</i>. A fortune, he said, was
given for a single day's work. Even the pay of the <i>chulos</i> seemed
to me to be extravagant, and a <i>banderillero</i> got enough to make
one rich for life. That night I thought over all I had seen and heard,
and fell asleep and dreamt I was an <i>espada</i>. the best in Spain,
and rich, and married to a lovely girl with golden hair&mdash;as boys
do dream.</p>

<p>"Next day I set myself to practice with our bulls. First I teased
one till he grew angry and rushed at me; then, as a <i>chulo</i>, I
stepped aside. And after I had practised this several times, I began to
try to move aside as late as possible and only just as far as was
needful; for I soon found out the play of horn of every bull we had.
The older the bull the heavier his neck and shoulders become, and,
therefore, the sweep of horns in an old bull is much smaller than a
young one's. Before the first morning's sport was over I knew that with
our bulls at any rate I could beat any <i>chulo</i> I had seen the day
before. Then I set myself to quiet the bulls, which was a little
difficult, and after I had succeeded I went back to my pony to read and
dream. Next day I played at being a <i>banderillero</i>, and found out
at once that my knowledge of the animal was all important. For I knew
always on which side to move to avoid the bull's rush. I knew how he
meant to strike by the way he put his head down. To plant the
<i>banderillas</i> perfectly would have been child's play to me,
atleast with our bulls. The <i>matador's</i> work was harder to
practise. I had no sword; besides, the bull I wished to pretend to
kill, was not tired and wouldn't keep quiet. Yet I went on trying. The
game had a fascination for me. A few days later, provided with a
makeshift red <i>capa</i>, I got a bull far away from the others. Then
I played with him till he was tired out. First I played as a
<i>chulo</i> , and avoided his rushes by an inch or two only; then, as
<i>banderillero</i>, I escaped his stroke, and, as I did so, struck his
neck with two sticks. When he was tired I approached him with the
<i>capa</i> and found I could make him do what I pleased, stand crooked
or square in a moment, just as I liked. For I learned at once that as a
rule the bull rushes at the <i>capa</i> and not at the man who holds
it. Some bulls, however, are clever enough to charge the man. For weeks
I kept up this game, till one day my father expressed his surprise at
the thin and wretched appearance of the bulls. No wonder! The pasture
ground had been a ring to them and me for many a week.</p>

<p>"After this I had to play <i>matador</i>&mdash;the only part which
had any interest for me&mdash;without first tiring them. Then came a
long series of new experiences, which in time made me what I was, a
real <i>espada</i>, but which I can scarcely describe to you.</p>

<p>"For power over wild animals comes to a man, as it were, by leaps
and bounds. Of a sudden one finds he can make a bull do something which
the day before he could not make him do. It is all a matter of intimate
knowledge of the nature of theanimal. Just as the shepherd, as I've
been told, knows the face of each sheep in a flock of a thousand,
though I can see no difference between the faces of sheep, which are
all alike stupid to me, so I came to know bulls, with a complete
understanding of the nature and temper of each one. It's just because I
can't tell you how I acquired this part of my knowledge that I was so
long-winded in explaining to you my first steps. What I knew more than
I have told you, will appear as I go on with my story, and that you
must believe or disbelieve as you think best."</p>

<p>"Oh," I cried, "you've explained everything so clearly, and thrown
light on so many things I didn't understand, that I shall believe
whatever you tell me."</p>

<p>Old Montes went on as if he hadn't heard my protestation:</p>

<p>"The next three years were intolerable to me: my stepmother repaid
my dislike with interest and found a hundred ways of making me
uncomfortable, without doing anything I could complain of and get
altered. In the spring of my nineteenth year I told my father I
intended to go to Madrid and become an <i>espada</i>. When he found he
couldn't induce me to stay, he said I might go. We parted, and I walked
to Seville; there I did odd jobs for a few weeks in connection with the
bull-ring, such as feeding the bulls, helping to separate them, and so
forth; and there I made an acquaintance who was afterwards a friend.
Juan Valdera was one of the <i>cuadrilla</i> of Girvalda, a
<i>matador</i> of the ordinary type. Juan was from Estramadura, andwe
could scarcely understand each other at first; but he was kindly and
careless and I took a great liking to him. He was a fine man; tall,
strong and handsome, with short, dark, wavy hair and dark moustache,
and great black eyes. He liked me, I suppose, because I admired him and
because I never wearied of hearing him tell of his conquests among
women and even great ladies. Of course I told him I wished to enter the
ring, and he promised to help me to get a place in Madrid where he knew
many of the officials. 'You may do well with the <i>capa</i>,' I
remember he said condescendingly, 'or even as a <i>banderillero</i>,
but you'll never go further. You see, to be an <i>espada</i>, as I
intend to be, you must have height and strength,' and he stretched his
fine figure as he spoke. I acquiesced humbly enough. I felt that
perhaps he and my father were right, and I didn't know whether I should
ever have strength enough for the task of an <i>espada</i>. To be
brief, I saved a little money, and managed to get to Madrid late in the
year, too late for the bull-ring. Thinking over the matter I resolved
to get work in a blacksmith's shop, and at length succeeded. As I had
thought, the labour strengthened me greatly, and in the spring of my
twentieth year, by Juan's help, I got employed on trial one Sunday as a
<i>chulo</i>.</p>

<p align="center" class="cen">* * * * *</p>

<p>"I suppose," Montes went on, after a pause, "I ought to have been
excited and nervous on that first Sunday&mdash;but I wasn't; I was only
eager to do well in order to get engaged for the season. The
blacksmith, Antonio, whom I had worked with,had advanced me the money
for my costume, and Juan had taken me to a tailor and got the things
made, and what I owed Antonio and the tailor weighed on me. Well, on
that Sunday I was a failure at first. I went in the procession with the
rest, then with the others I fluttered my <i>capa</i>; but when the
bull rushed at me, instead of running away, like the rest, I wrapped my
<i>capa</i> about me and, just as his horns were touching me, I moved
aside&mdash;not half a pace. The spectators cheered me, it is true, and
I thought I had done very well, until Juan came over to me, and
said:</p>

<p>"'You mustn't show off like that. First of all, you'll get killed if
you play that game; and then you fellows with the <i>capa</i> are there
to make the bull run about, to tire him out so that we <i>matadores</i>
may kill him.'</p>

<p>"That was my first lesson in professional jealousy. After that I ran
about like the rest, but without much heart in the sport. It seemed to
me stupid. Besides, from Juan's anger and contempt, I felt sure I
shouldn't get a permanent engagement. Bit by bit, however, my spirits
rose again with the exercise, and when the fifth or sixth bull came in
I resolved to make him run. It was a good, honest bull; I saw that at
once; he stood in the middle of the ring, excited, but not angry, in
spite of the waving of the <i>capas</i> all round him. As soon as my
turn came, I ran forward, nearer to him than the others had considered
safe, and waved the challenge with my <i>capa</i>. At once he rushed at
it, and I gave him a long run, half round the circle, and ended it by
stopping andletting him toss the <i>capa</i> which I held not quite at
arm's length from my body. As I did this I didn't turn round to face
him. I knew he'd toss the <i>capa</i> and not me, but the crowd rose
and cheered as if the thing were extraordinary. Then I felt sure I
should be engaged, and I was perfectly happy. Only Juan said to me a
few minutes later:</p>

<p>"'You'll be killed, my boy, one of these fine days if you try those
games. Your life will be a short one if you begin by trusting a
bull.'</p>

<p>"But I didn't mind what he said. I thought he meant it as a friendly
warning, and I was anxious only to get permanently engaged. And sure
enough, as soon as the games were over, I was sent for by the director.
He was kind to me, and asked me where I had played before. I told him
that was my first trial.</p>

<p>"'Ah!' he said, turning to a gentleman who was with him, 'I knew it,
Se&ntilde;or Duque; such courage always comes from&mdash;want of
experience, let me call it.'</p>

<p>"'No,' replied the gentleman, whom I afterwards knew as the Duke of
Medina Celi, the best <i>aficionado</i>, and one of the noblest men in
Spain; 'I'm not so sure of that. Why,' he went on, speaking now to me,
'did you keep your back turned to the bull?'</p>

<p>"'Se&ntilde;or,' I answered, ''twas an honest bull, and not angry,
and I knew he'd toss the <i>capa</i> without paying any attention to
me.'</p>

<p>"'Well,' said the Duke, 'if you know that much, and aren't afraid to
risk your life on yourknowledge, you'll go far. I must have a talk with
you some day, when I've more time; you can come and see me. Send in
your name; I shall remember.' And as he said this, he nodded to me and
waved his hand to the director, and went away.</p>

<p>"Then and there the director made me sign an engagement for the
season, and gave me one hundred <i>duros</i> as earnest money in
advance of my pay. What an evening we had after that! Juan, the tailor,
Antonio the blacksmith, and I. How glad and proud I was to be able to
pay my debts and still have sixty <i>duros</i> in my pocket after
entertaining my friends. If Juan had not hurt me every now and then by
the way he talked of my foolhardiness, I should have told them all I
knew; but I didn't. I only said I was engaged at a salary of a hundred
<i>duros</i> a month.</p>

<p>"'What!' said Juan. 'Come, tell the truth; make it fifty.'</p>

<p>"'No,' I said; 'it was a hundred,' and I pulled out the money.</p>

<p>"'Well,' he said, 'that only shows what it is to be small and young
and foolhardy! Here am I, after six years' experience, second, too, in
the <i>cuadrilla</i> of Girvalda, and I'm not getting much more than
that.'</p>

<p>Still, in spite of such little drawbacks, in spite, too, of the fact
that Juan had to go away early, to meet 'a lovely creature,' as he
said, that evening was one of the happiest I ever spent.</p>

<p>"All that summer through I worked every Sunday, and grew in favour
with the Madrile&ntilde;os, andwith the Madrile&ntilde;as, though not
with these in Juan's way. I was timid and young; besides, I had a
picture of a woman in my mind, and I saw no one like it. So I went on
studying the bulls, learning all I could about the different breeds,
and watching them in the ring. Then I sent money to my sister and to my
father, and was happy.</p>

<p>"In the winter I was a good deal with Antonio; every day I did a
spell of work in his shop to strengthen myself, and he, I think, got to
know that I intended to become an <i>espada</i>. At any rate, after my
first performance with the <i>capa</i>, he believed I could do whatever
I wished. He used often to say God had given him strength and me
brains, and he only wished he could exchange some of his muscle for
some of my wits. Antonio was not very bright, but he was good-tempered,
kind, and hard-working, the only friend I ever had. May Our Lady give
his soul rest!</p>

<p>"Next spring when the director sent for me, I said that I wanted to
work as a <i>banderillero</i>. He seemed to be surprised, told me I was
a favourite with the <i>capa</i>, and had better stick to that for
another season at least. But I was firm. Then he asked me whether I had
ever used the <i>banderillas</i> and where? The director always
believed I had been employed in some other ring before I came to
Madrid. I told him I was confident I could do the work. 'Besides,' I
added, 'I want more pay,' which was an untruth; but the argument seemed
to him decisive, and he engaged me at two hundred <i>duros</i> a month,
under the condition that, if the spectators wished it, I should work
now andthen with the <i>capa</i> as well. It didn't take me long to
show the <i>aficionados</i> in Madrid that I was as good with the
<i>banderillas</i> as I was with the <i>capa</i>. I could plant them
when and where I liked. For in this season I found I could make the
bull do almost anything. You know how the <i>banderillero</i> has to
excite the bull to charge him before he can plant the darts. He does
that to make the bull lower his head well, and he runs towards the bull
partly so that the bull may not know when to toss his head up, partly
because he can throw himself aside more easily when he's running fairly
fast. Well, again and again I made the bull lower his head and then
walked to him, planted the <i>banderillas</i>, and as he struck upwards
swayed aside just enough to avoid the blow. That was an infinitely more
difficult feat than anything I had ever done with the <i>capa</i>, and
it gave me reputation among the <i>aficionados</i> and also with the
<i>espadas</i>; but the ignorant herd of spectators preferred my trick
with the <i>capa</i>. So the season came and went. I had many a carouse
with Juan, and gave him money from time to time, because women always
made him spend more than he got. From that time, too, I gave my sister
fifty <i>duros</i> a month, and my father fifty. For before the season
was half over my pay was raised to four hundred <i>duros</i> a month,
and my name was always put on the bills. In fact I was rich and a
favourite of the public.</p>

<p>"So time went on, and my third season in Madrid began, and with it
came the beginning of the end. Never was any one more absolutelycontent
than I when we were told <i>los toros</i> would begin in a fortnight.
On the first Sunday I was walking carelessly in the procession beside
Juan, though I could have been next to the <i>espadas</i>, had I
wished, when he suddenly nudged me, saying:</p>

<p>"'Look up! there on the second tier; there's a face for you.'</p>

<p>"I looked up, and saw a girl with the face of my dreams, only much
more beautiful. I suppose I must have stopped, for Juan pulled me by
the arm crying: 'You're moonstruck, man; come on!' and on I
went&mdash;lovestruck in heart and brain and body. What a face it was!
The golden hair framed it like a picture, but the great eyes were
hazel, and the lips scarlet, and she wore the <i>mantilla</i> like a
queen. I moved forward like a man in a dream, conscious of nothing that
went on round me, till I heard Juan say:</p>

<p>"'She's looking at us. She knows we've noticed her. All right,
pretty one! we'll make friends afterwards.'</p>

<p>"'But how?' I asked, stupidly.</p>

<p>"'How!' he replied, mockingly. 'I'll just send some one to find out
who she is, and then you can send her a box for next Sunday, and pray
for her acquaintance, and the thing's done. I suppose that's her mother
sitting behind her,' he went on. 'I wonder if the other girl next to
her is the sister. She's as good-looking as the fairhaired one, and
easier to win, I'd bet. Strange haw all the timid ones take to me.' And
again he looked up.</p>

<p>"I said nothing; nor did I look up at the placewhere she was
sitting; but I worked that day as I had never worked before. Then, for
the first time, I did something that has never been done since by any
one. The first bull was honest and kindly: I knew the sort. So, when
the people began to call for El Peque&ntilde;o (the little
fellow)&mdash;that was the nickname they had given me&mdash;I took up a
<i>capa</i>, and, when the bull chased me, I stopped suddenly, faced
him, and threw the <i>capa</i> round me. He was within ten paces of me
before he saw I had stopped, and he began to stop; but before he came
to a standstill his horns were within a foot of me. He tossed his head
once or twice as if he would strike me, and then went off. The people
cheered and cheered as if they would never cease. Then I looked up at
her. She must have been watching me, for she took the red rose from her
hair and threw it into the ring towards me, crying, 'Bien! Muy bien! El
Peque&ntilde;o!'</p>

<p>"As I picked up the rose, pressed it to my lips, and hid it in my
breast, I realized all that life holds of triumphant joy! . . . Then I
made up my mind to show what I could do, and everything I did that day
seemed to delight the public. At last, as I planted the
<i>banderillas</i>, standing in front of the bull, and he tried twice
in quick succession to strike me and failed, the crowd cheered and
cheered and cheered, so that, even when I went away, after bowing and
stood among my fellows, ten minutes passed before they would let the
game go on. I didn't look up again. No! I wanted to keep the memory of
what she looked like when she threw me the rose.</p>

<p>"After the games were over, I met her, that same evening. Juan had
brought it about, and he talked easily enough to the mother and
daughter and niece, while I listened. We all went, I remember, to a
restaurant in the Puerta del Sol, and ate and drank together. I said
little or nothing the whole evening. The mother told us they had just
come from the north: Alvareda was the family name; her daughter was
Clemencia, the niece, Liberata. I heard everything in a sort of fever
of hot pulses and cold fits of humility, while Juan told them all about
himself, and what he meant to do and to be. While Clemencia listened to
him, I took my fill of gazing at her. At last Juan invited them all to
<i>los toros</i> on the following Sunday, and promised them the best
<i>palco</i> in the ring. He found out, too, where they lived, in a
little street running parallel to the Alcala, and assured them of our
visit within the week. Then they left, and as they went out of the door
Liberata looked at Juan, while Clemencia chatted with him and teased
him.</p>

<p>"'That's all right,' said Juan, turning to me when they were gone,
'and I don't know which is the more taking, the niece or Clemencia.
Perhaps the niece; she looks at one so appealingly; and those who talk
so with their eyes are always the best. I wonder have they any money.
One might do worse than either with a good portion.'</p>

<p>"'Is that your real opinion?' I asked hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' he answered; 'why?'</p>

<p>"'Because, in that case leave Clemencia to me.Of course you could
win her if you wanted to. But it makes no difference to you, and to me
all the difference. If I cannot marry her, I shall never marry.'</p>

<p>"'Gesu!' he cried, 'how fast you go, but I'd do more than that for
you, Montes; and besides, the niece really pleases me better.'</p>

<p>"So the matter was settled between us.</p>

<p>"Now, if I could tell you all that happened, I would. But much
escaped me at the time that I afterwards remembered, and many things
that then seemed to me to be as sure as a straight stroke, have since
grown confused. I only know that Juan and I met them often, and that
Juan paid court to the niece, while I from time to time talked timidly
to Clemencia.</p>

<p>"One Sunday after another came and went, and we grew to know each
other well. Clemencia did not chatter like other women: I liked her the
better for it, and when I came to know she was very proud, I liked
that, too. She charmed me; why? I can scarcely tell. I saw her faults
gradually, but even her faults appeared to me fascinating. Her pride
was insensate. I remember one Sunday afternoon after the games, I
happened to go into a restaurant, and found her sitting there with her
mother. I was in costume and carried in my hand a great nosegay of
roses that a lady had thrown me in the ring. Of course as soon as I saw
Clemencia I went over to her and&mdash;you know it is the privilege of
the <i>matadores</i> in Spain, even if they do not know the
lady&mdash;taking a rose from the bunch I presented it to her as the
fairest of thefair. Coming from the cold North, she didn't know the
custom and scarcely seemed pleased. When I explained it to her, she
exclaimed that it was monstrous; she'd never allow a mere
<i>matador</i> to take such a liberty unless she knew and liked him.
Juan expostulated with her laughingly; I said nothing; I knew what
qualities our work required, and didn't think it needed any defence. I
believe in that first season, I came to see that her name Clemencia
wasn't very appropriate. At any rate she had courage and pride, that
was certain. Very early in our friendship she wanted to know why I
didn't become an <i>espada</i>.</p>

<p>"'A man without ambition,' she said, 'was like a woman without
beauty.'</p>

<p>"I laughed at this and told her my ambition was to do my work well,
and advancement was sure to follow in due course. Love of her seemed to
have killed ambition in me. But no. She wouldn't rest content in spite
of Juan's telling her my position already was more brilliant than that
of most of the <i>espadas</i>.</p>

<p>"'He does things with the <i>capa</i> and the <i>banderillas</i>
which no <i>espada</i> in all Spain would care to imitate. And that's
position enough. Besides, to be an <i>espada</i> requires height and
strength.'</p>

<p>"As he said this she seemed to be convinced, but it annoyed me a
little, and afterwards as we walked together, I said to her,</p>

<p>"'If you want to see me work as an <i>espada</i>, you shall.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, no!' she answered half carelessly; 'ifyou can't do it, as Juan
says, why should you try? to fail is worse than to lack ambition.'</p>

<p>"'Well,' I answered, 'you shall see.'</p>

<p>"And then I took my courage in both hands and went on:</p>

<p>"'If you cared for me I should be the first <i>espada</i> in the
world next season.'</p>

<p>"She turned and looked at me curiously and said,</p>

<p>"'Of course I'd wish it if you could do it.'</p>

<p>"And I said, 'See, I love you as the priest loves the Virgin; tell
me to be an <i>espada</i> and I shall be one for the sake of your
love.'</p>

<p>"'That's what all men say, but love doesn't make a man tall and
strong.'</p>

<p>"'No; nor do size and strength take the place of heart and head. Do
you love me? That's the question.'</p>

<p>"'I like you, yes. But love&mdash;love, they say, comes after
marriage."</p>

<p>"'Will you marry me?'</p>

<p>"'Become an <i>espada</i> and then ask me again,' she answered
coquettishly.</p>

<p>"The very next day I went to see the Duke of Medina Celi; the
servants would scarcely let me pass till they heard my name and that
the Duke had asked me to come. He received me kindly. I told him what I
wanted.</p>

<p>"'Have you ever used the sword?' he asked in surprise. 'Can you do
it? You see we don't want to lose the best man with <i>capa</i> and
<i>banderillas</i> ever known, to get another second-class
<i>espada</i> .'</p>

<p>"And I answered him,</p>

<p>"'Se&ntilde;or Duque, I have done better with the <i>banderillas</i>
than I could with the <i>capa</i>. I shall do better with the
<i>espada</i> than with the <i>banderillas</i>.'</p>

<p>"'You little fiend!' he laughed, 'I believe you will, though it is
unheard of to become an <i>espada</i> without training; but now for the
means. All the <i>espadas</i> are engaged; it'll be difficult. Let me
see. . . . The Queen has asked me to superintend the sports early in
July, and then I shall give you your chance. Will that do? In the
meantime, astonish us all with <i>capa</i> and <i>banderillas</i>, so
that men may not think me mad when I put your name first on the
bill.'</p>

<p>"I thanked him from my heart, as was his due, and after a little
more talk I went away to tell Clemencia the news. She only said:</p>

<p>"'I'm glad. Now you'll get Juan to help you.'</p>

<p>"I stared at her.</p>

<p>"'Yes!' she went on, a little impatiently; 'he has been taught the
work; he's sure to be able to show you a great deal.'</p>

<p>"I said not a word. She was sincere, I saw, but then she came from
the North and knew nothing. I said to myself, 'That's how women
are!'</p>

<p>"She continued, 'Of course you're clever with the <i>capa</i> and
<i>banderillas</i>, and now you must do more than ever, as the Duke
said, to deserve your chance.' And then she asked carelessly, 'Couldn't
you bring the Duke and introduce him to us some time or other? I should
like to thank him.'</p>

<p>"And I, thinking it meant our betrothal, wasglad, and promised. And
I remember I did bring him once to the box and he was kind in a way,
but not cordial as he always was when alone with me, and he told
Clemencia that I'd go very far, and that any woman would be lucky to
get me for a husband, and so on. And after a little while he went away.
But Clemencia was angry with him and said he put on airs, and, indeed,
I had never seen him so cold and reserved; I could say little or
nothing in his defence.</p>

<p>"Well, all that May I worked as I had never done. The Director told
me he knew I was to use the <i>espada</i> on the first Sunday in July,
and he seemed to be glad; and one or two of the best <i>espadas</i>
came to me and said they'd heard the news and should be glad to welcome
me among them. All this excited me, and I did better and better. I used
to pick out the old prints of Goya, the great painter&mdash;you know
his works are in the Prado&mdash;and do everything the old
<i>matadores</i> did, and invent new things. But nothing 'took' like my
trick with the <i>capa</i>. One Sunday, I remember, I had done it with
six bulls, one after the other, and the people cheered and cheered. But
the seventh was a bad bull, and, of course, I didn't do it. And
afterwards Clemencia asked me why I didn't, and I told her. For you see
I didn't know then that women rate high what they don't understand.
Mystery is everything to them. As if the explanation of such a thing
makes it any easier. A man wins great battles by seizing the right
moment and using it&mdash;the explanation is simple. One must be great
in order to know the moment, that'sall. But women don't see that it is
only small men who exaggerate the difficulties of their work. Great men
find their work easy and say so, and, therefore, you'll find that women
underrate great men and overpraise small ones. Clemencia really thought
I ought to learn the <i>espada's</i> work from Juan. Ah! women are
strange creatures. . . . Well, after that Sunday she was always
bothering me to do the <i>capa</i> trick with every bull.</p>

<p>If you don't,' she used to say, 'you won't get the chance of being
an <i>espada</i>.' And when she saw I laughed and paid no attention to
her talk, she became more and more obstinate.</p>

<p>If the people get to know you can only do it with some bulls, they
won't think much of you. Do it with every bull, then they can't say
anything.'</p>

<p>"And I said 'No! and I shouldn't be able to say anything
either.'</p>

<p>"'If you love me you will do as I say!'</p>

<p>"And when I didn't do as she wished,&mdash;it was madness&mdash;she
grew cold to me, and sneered at me, and then urged me again, till I
half yielded. Really, by that time I hardly knew what I couldn't do,
for each day I seemed to get greater power over the bulls. At length a
Sunday came, the first, I think in June, or the last in May. Clemencia
sat with her mother and cousin in the best <i>palco</i>; I had got it
from the Director, who now refused me nothing. I had done my
<i>capa</i> trick with three bulls, one after the other, then the
fourth came in. As soon as I saw him, I knew he was bad, cunning I
mean, and with black ragein the heart of him. The other men stood aside
to let me do the trick, but I wouldn't. I ran away like the rest, and
let him toss the <i>capa</i>. The people liked me, and so they cheered
just the same, thinking I was tired; but suddenly Clemencia called out:
'The <i>capa</i> round the shoulders; the <i>capa</i> trick!' and I
looked up at her; and she leaned over the front of the <i>palco</i>,
and called out the words again.</p>

<p>"Then rage came into me, rage at her folly and cold heart; I took
off my cap to her, and turned and challenged the bull with the
<i>capa</i> , and, as he put down his head and rushed, I threw the
<i>capa</i> round me and stood still. I did not even look at him. I
knew it was no use. He struck me here on the thigh, and I went up into
the air. The shock took away my senses. As I came to myself they were
carrying me out of the ring, and the people were all standing up; but,
as I looked towards the <i>palco</i>, I saw she wasn't standing up: she
had a handkerchief before her face. At first I thought she was crying,
and I felt well, and longed to say to her, 'It doesn't matter, I'm
content;' then she put down the handkerchief and I saw she wasn't
crying; there wasn't a tear in her eyes. She seemed surprised merely
and shocked. I suppose she thought I could work miracles, or rather she
didn't care much whether I was hurt or not. That turned me faint again.
I came to myself in my bed, where I spent the next month. The doctor
told the Duke of Medina Celi&mdash;he had come to see me the same
afternoon&mdash;that the shock hadn't injured me, but I should be
lamealways, as the bull's horn had torn the muscles of my thigh from
the bone. 'How he didn't bleed to death,' he said, 'is a wonder; now
he'll pull through, but no more play with the bulls for him.' I knew
better than the doctor, but I said nothing to him, only to the Duke I
said: .</p>

<p>"'Se&ntilde;or, a promise is a promise; I shall use the
<i>espada</i> in your show in July.'</p>

<p>"And he said, 'Yes, my poor boy, if you wish it, and are able to;
but how came you to make such a mistake?'</p>

<p>"'I made no mistake, Se&ntilde;or.'</p>

<p>"'You knew you'd be struck?'</p>

<p>"I nodded. He looked at me for a moment, and then held out his hand.
He understood everything I'm sure; but he said nothing to me then.</p>

<p>"Juan came to see me in the evening, and next day Clemencia and her
mother. Clemencia was sorry, that I could see, and wanted me to forgive
her. As if I had anything to forgive when she stood there so lithe and
straight, with her flowerlike face and the appealing eyes. Then came
days of pain while the doctors forced the muscles back into their
places. Soon I was able to get up, with a crutch, and limp about. As I
grew better, Clemencia came seldomer, and when she came, her mother
never left the room. I knew what that meant. She had told her mother
not to go away; for, though the mother thought no one good enough for
her daughter, yet she pitied me, and would have left us
alone&mdash;sometimes. She had a woman's heart. But no, not once. Then
I set myself to get well soon. I would show them all,I said to myself,
that a lame Montes was worth more than other men. And I got better, so
the doctor said, with surprising speed. . . . One day, towards the end
of June, I said to the servant of the Duke&mdash;he sent a servant
every day to me with fruit and flowers&mdash;that I wished greatly to
see his master. And the Duke came to see me, the very same day.</p>

<p>"I thanked him first for all his kindness to me, and then asked:</p>

<p>"'Se&ntilde;or, have you put my name on the bills as
<i>espada</i>?'</p>

<p>"'No,' he replied; 'you must get well first, and, indeed, if I were
in your place, I should not try anything more till next season.'</p>

<p>"And I said, 'Se&ntilde;or Duque, it presses. Believe me, weak as I
am, I can use the sword.'</p>

<p>"And he answered my very thought: 'Ah! She thinks you can't. And you
want to prove the contrary. I shouldn't take the trouble, if I were
you; but there! Don't deceive yourself or me; there is time yet for
three or four days: I'll come again to see you, and if you wish to have
your chance you shall. I give you my word.' As he left the room I had
tears in my eyes; but I was glad, too, and confident: I'd teach the
false friends a lesson. Save Antonio, the blacksmith, and some
strangers, and the Duke's servant, no one had come near me for more
than a week. Three days afterwards I wrote to the Duke asking him to
fulfil his promise, and the very next day Juan, Clemencia, and her
mother all came to see me together. They all wanted to know what it
meant.My name as <i>espada</i> for the next Sunday, they said, was
first on the bills placarded all over Madrid, and the Duke had put
underneath it&mdash;'By special request of H.M. the Queen.' I said
nothing but that I was going to work; and I noticed that Clemencia
wouldn't meet my eyes.</p>

<p>"What a day that was! That Sunday I mean. The Queen was in her box
with the Duke beside her as our procession saluted them, and the great
ring was crowded tier on tier, and she was in the best box I could get.
But I tried not to think about her. My heart seemed to be frozen. Still
I know now that I worked for her even then. When the first bull came in
and the <i>capa</i> men played him, the people began to shout for
me&mdash;'El Peque&ntilde;o! El Peque&ntilde;o! El
Peque&ntilde;o!'&mdash;and wouldn't let the games go on. So I limped
forward in my <i>espada's</i> dress and took a <i>capa</i> from a man
and challenged the bull, and he rushed at me&mdash;the honest one; I
caught his look and knew it was all right, so I threw the <i>capa</i>
round me and turned my back upon him. In one flash I saw the people
rise in their places, and the Duke lean over the front of the
<i>palco</i>; then, as the bull hesitated and stopped, and they began
to cheer, I handed back the <i>capa</i>, and, after bowing, went again
among the <i>espadas</i>. Then the people christened me afresh&mdash;'
El Cojo!' (The Cripple!)&mdash;and I had to come forward and bow again
and again, and the Queen threw me a gold cigarette case. I have it
still. There it is, . . . I never looked up at Clemencia, though I
could see her always. She threw no rose to me that day. . . .Then the
time came when I should kill the bull. I took the <i>muleta</i> in my
left hand and went towards him with the sword uncovered in my right. I
needed no trick. I held him with my will, and he looked up at me. 'Poor
brute,' I thought, 'you are happier than I am.' And he bowed his head
with the great, wondering, kindly eyes, and I struck straight through
to the heart. On his knees he fell at my feet, and rolled over dead,
almost without a quiver. As I hid my sword in the <i>muleta</i> and
turned away, the people found their voices, 'Well done, The Cripple!
Well done!' When I left the ring that day I left it as the first
<i>espada</i> in Spain. So the Duke said, and he knew&mdash;none
better. After one more Sunday the sports were over for the year, but
that second Sunday I did better than the first, and I was engaged for
the next season as first <i>espada</i>, with fifty thousand
<i>duros</i> salary. Forty thousand I invested as the Duke
advised&mdash;I have lived on the interest ever since&mdash;the other
ten thousand I kept by me.</p>

<p align="center" class="cen">* * * * *</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"I had resolved never to go near Clemencia again, and I kept my
resolve for weeks. One day Juan came and told me Clemencia was
suffering because of my absence. He said:</p>

<p>"'She's proud, you know, proud as the devil, and she won't come and
see you or send to you, but she loves you. There's no doubt of that:
she loves you. I know them, and I never saw a girl so gone on a man.
Besides they're poor now, she and her mother; they've eaten up nearly
all they had, and you're rich and could help them.'</p>

<p>"That made me think. I felt sure she didn't love me. That was plain
enough. She hadn't even a good heart, or she would have come and
cheered me up when I lay wounded&mdash;because of her obstinate folly.
No! It wasn't worth while suffering any more on her account. That was
clear. But if she needed me, if she were really poor? Oh, that I
couldn't stand. I'd go to her. 'Are you sure?' I asked Juan, and when
he said he was, I said:</p>

<p>"'Then I'll visit them to-morrow.'</p>

<p>"And on the next day I went. Clemencia received me as usual: she was
too proud to notice my long absence, but the mother wanted to know why
I had kept away from them so long. From that time on the mother seemed
to like me greatly. I told her I was still sore&mdash;which was the
truth&mdash;and I had had much to do.</p>

<p>"'Some lady fallen in love with you, I suppose,' said Clemencia half
scoffingly&mdash;so that I could hardly believe she had wanted to see
me.</p>

<p>"'No,' I answered, looking at her, 'one doesn't get love without
seeking for it, sometimes not even then&mdash;when one's small and lame
as I am.'</p>

<p>"Gradually the old relations established themselves again. But I had
grown wiser, and watched her now with keen eyes as I had never done
formerly. I found she had changed&mdash;in some subtle way had become
different. She seemed kinder to me, but at the same time her character
appeared to be even stronger than it had been. I remember noticing one
peculiarity in her I had not remarked before. Her admiration of the
physique of menwas now keen and outspoken. When we went to the theatre
(as we often did) I saw that the better-looking and more finely-formed
actors had a great attraction for her. I had never noticed this in her
before. In fact she had seemed to me to know nothing about virile
beauty, beyond a girl's vague liking for men who were tall and strong.
But now she looked at men critically. She had changed; that was
certain. What was the cause? . . . I could not divine. Poor fool that I
was! I didn't know then that good women seldom or never care much for
mere bodily qualities in a man; the women who do are generally
worthless. Now, too, she spoke well of the men of Southern Spain; when
I first met her she professed to admire the women of the South, but to
think little of the men. Now she admired the men, too; they were
warmer-hearted, she said; had more love and passion in them, and were
gentler with women than those of the North. Somehow I hoped that she
referred to me, that her heart was beginning to plead for me, and I was
very glad and proud, though it all seemed too good to be true.</p>

<p>"One day in October, when I called with Juan, we found them packing
their things. They had to leave, they said, and take cheaper lodgings.
Juan looked at me, and some way or other I got him to take Clemencia
into another room. Then I spoke to the mother: Clemencia, I hoped,
would soon be my wife; in any case I couldn't allow her to want for
anything; I would bring a thousand <i>duros</i> the next day, and they
must not think of leaving their comfortable apartments. The mothercried
and said, I was good: 'God makes few such men,' and so forth. The next
day I gave her the money, and it was arranged between us without saying
anything to Clemencia. I remember about this time, in the early winter
of that year, I began to see her faults more clearly, and I noticed
that she had altered in many ways. Her temper had changed. It used to
be equable though passionate. It had become uncertain and irritable.
She had changed greatly. For now, she would let me kiss her without
remonstrance, and sometimes almost as if she didn't notice the kiss,
whereas before it used always to be a matter of importance. And when I
asked her when she would marry me she would answer half-carelessly,
'Some time, I suppose,' as she used to do, but her manner was quite
different. She even sighed once as she spoke. Certainly she had
changed. What was the cause? I couldn't make it out, therefore I
watched, not suspiciously, but she had grown a little strange to
me&mdash;a sort of puzzle, since she had been so unkind when I lay
wounded. And partly from this feeling, partly from my great love for
her, I noticed everything. Still I urged her to marry me. I thought as
soon as we were married, and she had a child to take care of and to
love, it would be all right with both of us. Fool that I was!</p>

<p>"In April, which was fine, I remember, that year in Madrid&mdash;you
know how cold it is away up there, and how keen the wind is; as the
Madrile&ntilde;os say, ''twon't blow out a candle, but it'll kill a
man'&mdash;Clemencia began to grow pale and nervous. I couldn't make
her out; and so, more than ever,pity strengthening love in me, I urged
her to tell me when she would marry me; and one day she turned to me,
and I saw she was quite white as she said:</p>

<p>"'After the season, perhaps.'</p>

<p>"Then I was happy, and ceased to press her. Early in May the games
began&mdash;my golden time. I had grown quite strong again, and was
surer of myself than ever. Besides, I wanted to do something to deserve
my great happiness. Therefore, on one of the first days when the Queen
and the Duke and Clemencia were looking on, I killed the bull with the
sword immediately after he entered the ring, and before he had been
tired at all. From that day on the people seemed crazy about me. I
couldn't walk in the streets without being cheered; a crowd followed me
wherever I went; great nobles asked me to their houses, and their
ladies made much of me. But I didn't care, for all the time Clemencia
was kind, and so I was happy.</p>

<p>"One day suddenly she asked me why I didn't make Juan an
<i>espada</i> . I told her I had offered him the first place in my
<i>cuadrilla</i>; but he wouldn't accept it. She declared that it was
natural of him to refuse when I had passed him in the race; but why
didn't I go to the Duke and get him made an <i>espada</i>? I replied
laughingly that the Duke didn't make men <i>espadas</i>, but God or
their parents. Then her brows drew down, and she said she hadn't
thought to find such mean jealousy in me. So I answered her seriously
that I didn't believe Juan would succeed as an <i>espada</i>, or else I
should dowhat I could to get him appointed. At once she came and put
her arms on my shoulders, and said 'twas like me, and she would tell
Juan; and after that I could do nothing but kiss her. A little later I
asked Juan about it, and he told me he thought he could do the work at
least as well as Girvalda, and if I got him the place, he would never
forget my kindness. So I went to the Director and told him what I
wished. At first he refused, saying Juan had no talent, he would only
get killed. When I pressed him he said all the <i>espadas</i> were
engaged, and made other such excuses. So at last I said I'd work no
more unless he gave Juan a chance. Then he yielded after grumbling a
great deal.</p>

<p>"Two Sundays later Juan entered the ring for the first time as an
<i>espada</i>. He looked the part to perfection. Never was there a more
splendid figure of a man, and he was radiant in silver and blue. His
mother was in the box that day with Clemencia and her mother. Just
before we all parted as the sports were about to begin, Clemencia drew
me on one side, and said, 'You'll see that he succeeds, won't you?' And
I replied, 'Yes, of course, I will. Trust me; it'll be all right.' And
it was, though I don't think it would have been, if she hadn't spoken.
I remembered my promise to her, and when I saw that the bull which Juan
ought to kill was vicious, I told another <i>espada</i> to kill him,
and so got Juan an easy bull, which I took care to have tired out
before I told him the moment had come. Juan wasn't a coward&mdash;no!
but he hadn't the peculiar nerve needed forthe business. The
<i>matador's</i> spirit should rise to the danger, and Juan's didn't
rise. He was white, but determined to do his best. That I could see. So
I said to him, 'Go on, man! Don't lose time, or he'll get his wind
again. You're all right; I shall be near you as one of your
<i>cuadrilla</i>.' And so I was, and if I hadn't been, Juan would have
come to grief. Yes, he'd have come to grief that very first day.</p>

<p>"Naturally enough we spent the evening together. It was a real
<i>tertulia</i>, Se&ntilde;ora Alvareda said; but Clemencia sat silent
with the great, dark eyes turned in upon her thoughts, and the niece
and myself were nearly as quiet, while Juan talked for every one, not
forgetting himself. As he had been depressed before the trial so now he
was unduly exultant, forgetting altogether, as it seemed to me, not
only his nervousness but also that it had taken him two strokes to kill
the bull. His first attempt was a failure, and the second one, though
it brought the bull to his knees, never reached his heart. But Juan was
delighted and seemed never to weary of describing the bull and how he
had struck him, his mother listening to him the while adoringly. It was
past midnight when we parted from our friends; and Juan, as we returned
to my rooms, would talk of nothing but the salary he expected to get. I
was out of sorts; he had bragged so incessantly I had scarcely got a
word with Clemencia, who could hardly find time to tell me she had a
bad headache. Juan would come up with me; he wanted to know whether I'd
go on the morrow to the Director to get him apermanent engagement. I
got rid of him, at last, by saying I was tired to death, and it would
look better to let the Director come and ask for his services. So at
length we parted. After he left me I sat for some time wondering at
Clemencia's paleness. She was growing thin too! And what thoughts had
induced that rapt expression of face?</p>

<p>"Next morning I awoke late and had so much to do that I resolved to
put off my visit to Clemencia till the afternoon, but in the meantime
the Director spoke to me of Juan as rather a bungler, and when I
defended him, agreed at last to engage him for the next four Sundays.
This was a better result than I had expected, so as soon as I was free
I made off to tell Juan the good news. I met his mother at the street
door where she was talking with some women; she followed me into the
patio saying Juan was not at home.</p>

<p>"'Never mind,' I replied carelessly, 'I have good news for him, so
I'll go upstairs to his room and wait.'</p>

<p>"'Oh!' she said, 'you can't do that; you mustn't; Juan wouldn't like
it.'</p>

<p>"Then I laughed outright. Juan wouldn't like it&mdash;oh no! It was
amusing to say that when we had lived together like brothers for years,
and had had no secrets from one another. But she persisted and grew
strangely hot and excited. Then I thought to myself&mdash;there you are
again; these women understand nothing. So I went away, telling her to
send Juan to me as soon as he came in.At this she seemed hugely
relieved and became voluble in excuses. In fact her manner altered so
entirely that before I had gone fifty yards down the street, it forced
me to wonder. Suddenly my wonder changed to suspicion. Juan wasn't out!
Who was with him I mustn't see?</p>

<p>"As I stopped involuntarily, I saw a man on the other side of the
street who bowed to me. I went across and said:</p>

<p>"'Friend, I am Montes, the <i>matador</i>. Do you own this
house?'</p>

<p>"He answered that he did, and that every one in Madrid knew me.</p>

<p>"So I said, 'Lend me a room on your first-floor for an hour; <i>cosa
de mujer</i>; (A lady's in the case.) you understand.'</p>

<p>"At once he led me up-stairs and showed me a room from the windows
of which I could see the entrance to Juan's lodging. I thanked him, and
when he left me I stood near the window and smoked and thought. What
could it all mean? . . . Had Clemencia anything to do with Juan? She
made me get him his trial as <i>espada</i>; charged me to take care of
him. He was from the South, too, and she had grown to like Southern
men: 'they were passionate and gentle with women.' Curses on her! Her
paleness occurred to me, her fits of abstraction. As I thought, every
memory fitted into its place, and what had been mysterious grew plain
to me; but I wouldn't accept the evidence of reason. No! I'd wait and
see. Then I'd&mdash;at once I grew quiet. But again the thoughts
came-like the flies that plague thecattle in summer time&mdash;and
again I brushed them aside, and again they returned.</p>

<p>"Suddenly I saw Juan's mother come into the street wearing
altogether too careless an expression. She looked about at haphazard as
if she expected someone. After a moment or two of this she slipped back
into the patio with mystery in her sudden decision and haste. Then out
came a form I knew well, and, with stately, even step, looking neither
to the right hand nor the left, walked down the street. It was
Clemencia, as my heart had told me it would be. I should have known her
anywhere even had she not&mdash;just below the window where I was
watching&mdash;put back her <i>mantilla</i> with a certain proud grace
of movement which I had admired a hundred times. As she moved her head
to feel that the <i>mantilla</i> draped her properly I saw her face; it
was drawn and set like one fighting against pain. That made me smile
with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Five minutes later Juan swung out of the doorway in the full
costume of an <i>espada</i>&mdash;he seemed to sleep in it
now&mdash;with a cigarette between his teeth. Then I grew sad and
pitiful. We had been such friends. I had meant only good to him always.
And he was such a fool! I understood it all now; knew, as if I had been
told, that the intimacy between them dated from the time when I lay
suffering in bed. Thinking me useless and never having had any real
affection for me, Clemencia had then followed her inclination and tried
to win Juan. She had succeeded easily enough, no doubt, but not in
getting him to marry her.Later, she induced me to make Juan an eapada,
hoping against hope that he'd marry her when his new position had made
him rich. On the other hand he had set himself to cheat me because of
the money I had given her mother, which relieved him from the necessity
of helping them, and secondly, because it was only through my influence
that he could hope to become an <i>espada</i>. Ignoble beasts! And then
jealousy seized me as I thought of her admiration of handsome men, and
at once I saw her in his arms. Forthwith pity, and sadness, and anger
left me, and, as I thought of him swaggering past the window, I laughed
aloud. Poor weak fools! I, too, could cheat.</p>

<p>"He had passed out of the street. I went downstairs and thanked the
landlord for his kindness to me. 'For your good-nature,' I said, 'you
must come and see me work from a box next Sunday. Ask for me, I won't
forget.' And he thanked me with many words and said he had never missed
a Sunday since he had first seen me play with the <i>capa</i> three
years before. I laughed and nodded to him and went my way homewards,
whither I knew Juan had gone before me.</p>

<p>"As I entered my room, he rose to meet me with a shadow as of doubt
or fear upon him. But I laughed cheerfully, gaily enough to deceive
even so finished an actor as he was, and told him the good news.
'Engaged,' I cried, slapping him on the shoulder. 'The Director engages
you for four Sundays certain.' And that word 'certain' made me laugh
louder still&mdash;jubilantly. Then afraid of overdoing my part, I sat
quietly forsome time and listened to his expressions of fatuous
self-satisfaction. As he left me to go and trumpet the news from
<i>caf&eacute;</i> to <i>cafe&eacute;</i>, I had to choke down my
contempt for him by recalling that picture, by forcing myself to see
them in each other's arms. Then I grew quiet again and went to call
upon my betrothed.</p>

<p>"She was at home and received me as usual, but with more kindness
than was her wont. 'She feels a little remorse at deceiving me,' I said
to myself, reading her now as if her soul were an open book. I told her
of Juan's engagement and she let slip 'I wish I had known that sooner!'
But I did not appear to notice anything. It amused me now to see how
shallow she was and how blind I had been. And then I played with her as
she had often, doubtless, played with me. 'He will go far, will Juan,'
I said, 'now that he has begun&mdash;very far, in a short time.' And
within me I laughed at the double meaning as she turned startled eyes
upon me. And then, 'His old loves will mourn for the distance which
must soon separate him from them. Oh, yes, Juan will go far and leave
them behind.' I saw a shade come upon her face, and, therefore, added:
'But no one will grudge him his success. He's so good-looking and
good-tempered, and kind and true.' And then she burst into tears, and I
went to her and asked as if suspiciously, 'Why, what's the matter?
Clemencia!' Amid her sobs, she told me she didn't know, but she felt
upset, out of sorts, nervous: she had a headache. 'Heartache,' I
laughed to myself, and bade her go and lie down; rest would do her
good; I'd come againon the morrow. As I turned to leave the room she
called me back and put her arms round my neck and asked me to be
patient with her; she was foolish, but she'd make it up to me yet. . .
. And I comforted her, the poor, shallow fool, and went away.</p>

<p>"In some such fashion as this the days passed; each hour&mdash;now
my eyes were opened&mdash;bringing me some fresh entertainment; for, in
spite of their acting, I saw that none of them were happy. I knew
everything. I guessed that Juan, loving his liberty, was advising
Clemencia to make up to me, and I saw how badly she played her part.
And all this had escaped me a few days before; I laughed at myself more
contemptuously than at them. It interested me, too, to see that
Liberata had grown suspicious. She no longer trusted Juan's
protestations implicitly. Every now and then, with feminine bitterness,
she thrust the knife of her own doubt and fear into Clemencia' s wound.
'Don't you think, Montes, Clemencia is getting pale and thin?' she'd
ask; 'it is for love of you, you know. She should marry soon.' And all
the while she cursed me in her heart for a fool, while I laughed to
myself. The comedy was infinitely amusing to me, for now I held the
cords in my hand, and knew I could drop the curtain and cut short the
acting just when I liked. Clemencia's mother, too, would sometimes set
to work to amuse me as she went about with eyes troubled, as if anxious
for the future, and yet stomach-satisfied with the comforts of the
present. She, too, thought it worth while, now and then, to befoolme,
when fear came upon her&mdash;between meals. That did not please me!
When she tried to play with me, the inconceivable stupidity of my
former blind trust became a torture to me. Juan's mother I saw but
little of; yet I liked her. She was honest at least, and deceit was
difficult to her. Juan was her idol; all he did was right in her eyes;
it was not her fault that she couldn't see he was like a poisoned well.
All these days Juan was friendly to me as usual, with scarcely a shade
of the old condescension in his manner. He no longer showed envy by
remarking upon my luck. Since he himself had been tested, he seemed to
give me as much respect as his self-love could spare. Nor did he now
boast, as he used to do, of his height and strength. Once, however, on
the Friday evening, I think it was, he congratulated Clemencia on my
love for her, and joked about our marriage. The time had come to drop
the curtain and make an end.</p>

<p>"On the Saturday I went to the ring and ordered my <i>palco</i> to
be filled with flowers. From there I went to the Duke of Medina Celi.
He received me as always, with kindness, thought I looked ill, and
asked me whether I felt the old wound still. 'No,' I replied, 'no,
Se&ntilde;or Duque, and if I come to you now it is only to thank you
once more for all your goodness to me.'</p>

<p>"And he said after a pause&mdash;I remember each word; for he meant
well:</p>

<p>"'Montes, there's something very wrong.' And then, 'Montes, one
should never adore a woman; they all want a master. My hairs have
growngrey in learning that. . . . A woman, you see, may look well and
yet be cold-hearted and&mdash;not good. But a man would be a fool to
refuse nuts because one that looked all right was hollow.'</p>

<p>"'You are wise,' I said, 'Se&ntilde;or Duque! and I have been
foolish. I hope it may be well with you always; but wisdom and folly
come to the same end at last.'</p>

<p>"After I left him I went to Antonio and thanked him, and gave him a
letter to be opened in a week. There were three enclosures in
it&mdash;one for himself, one for the mother of Juan, and one for the
mother of Clemencia, and each held three thousand <i>duros</i>. As they
had cheated me for money, money they should have&mdash;with my
contempt. Then I went back to the ring, and as I looked up to my
<i>palco</i> and saw that the front of it was one bed of white and
scarlet blossoms, I smiled. 'White for purity,' I said, 'and scarlet
for blood, a fit show!' And I went home and slept like a child.</p>

<p>"Next day in the ring I killed two bulls, one on his first rush, and
the other after the usual play. Then another <i>espada</i> worked, and
then came the turn of Juan. As the bull stood panting I looked up at
the <i>palco</i>. There they all were, Clemencia with hands clasped on
the flowers and fixed, dilated eyes, her mother half asleep behind her.
Next to Clemencia, the niece with flushed cheeks, and leaning on her
shoulder his mother. Juan was much more nervous than he had been on the
previous Sunday. As his bull came into the ring he asked me hurriedly:
'Do you thinkit's an easy one?' I told him carelessly that all bulls
were easy and he seemed to grow more and more nervous. When the bull
was ready for him he turned to me, passing his tongue feverishly over
his dry lips.</p>

<p>"'You'll stand by me, won't you, Montes?'</p>

<p>"And I asked with a smile:</p>

<p>"'Shall I stand by you as you've stood by me?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, of course, we've always been friends.'</p>

<p>"'I shall be as true to you as you have been to me!' I said. And I
moved to his right hand and looked at the bull. It was a good one; I
couldn't have picked a better. In his eyes I saw courage that would
never yield and hate that would strike in the death-throe, and I
exulted and held his eyes with mine, and promised him revenge. While he
bowed his horns to the <i>muleta</i>, he still looked at me and I at
him; and as I felt that Juan had levelled his sword, and was on the
point of striking, I raised my head with a sweep to the side, as if I
had been the bull; and as I swung, so the brave bull swung too. And
then&mdash;then all the ring swam round with me, and yet I had heard
the shouting and seen the spectators spring to their feet. . . .</p>

<p>"I was in the street close to the Alvaredas'. The mother met me at
the door; she was crying and the tears were running down her fat,
greasy cheeks. She told me Clemencia had fainted and had been carried
home, and Juan was dead&mdash;ripped open&mdash;and his mother
distracted, and 'twas a pity, for he was so handsome and kind
andgood-natured, and her best dress was ruined, and <i>los toros</i>
shouldn't be allowed, and&mdash;as I brushed past her in
disgust&mdash;that Clemencia was in her room crying.</p>

<p>"I went up-stairs and entered the room. There she sat with her
elbows on the table and her hair all round her face and down her back,
and her fixed eyes stared at me. As I closed the door and folded my
arms and looked at her, she rose, and her stare grew wild with surprise
and horror, and then, almost without moving her lips, she said:</p>

<p>"'Holy Virgin! You did it! I see it in your face!'</p>

<p>"And my heart jumped against my arms for joy, and I said in the same
slow whisper, imitating her:</p>

<p>"'Yes; I did it.'</p>

<p>"As I spoke she sprang forward with hate in her face, and poured out
a stream of loathing and contempt on me. She vomited abuse as from her
very soul: I was low and base and cowardly; I was&mdash;God knows what
all. And he was handsome and kind, with a face like a king. . . . And I
had thought she could love me, me, the ugly, little, lame cur while he
was there. And she laughed. She'd never have let my lips touch her if
it hadn't been that her mother liked me and to please him. And now I
had killed him, the best friend I had. Oh, 'twas horrible! Then she
struck her head with her fists and asked how God, God, God could allow
me to kill a man whose finger was worth a thousand lives such as
mine!</p>

<p>"Then I laughed and said:</p>

<p>"'You mistake. You killed him. You made him an
<i>espada</i>&mdash;you!'</p>

<p>"As I spoke her eyes grew fixed and her mouth opened, and she seemed
to struggle to speak, but she only groaned&mdash;and fell face forwards
on the floor.</p>

<p>"I turned and left the room as her mother entered it." After a long
pause Montes went on:</p>

<p>"I heard afterwards that she died next morning in premature
child-birth. I left Madrid that night and came here, where I have lived
ever since, if this can be called living, . . . Yet at times now fairly
content, save for one thing&mdash;'Remorse?' Yes!"&mdash;And the old
man rose to his feet, while his great eyes blazing with passion held
me&mdash;"Remorse! That I let the bull kill him.</p>

<p>"I should have torn his throat out with my own hands."</p>

(A CONFESSION)

<p> </p>

<p class="l">MY BOYHOOD and youth were passed in Brighton. I entered
the College there as a boy of ten, and went through every class on the
Modern side in the usual seven years. I only tell this to show that
from the beginning my father intended me to go into business, and that
I was not particularly clever at books. I loved football as much as I
hated French, and I learned more of "fives" in half an hour than I knew
of German after eight years' teaching. In fact, if it had not been for
mathematics I should not have got my "remove" each year regularly as I
managed to do. There were lots of fellows who could beat my head off at
learning; but there were very few as strong or as good at games, and
I'd have been Captain of the School if Wilson, who was one of the best
"bats" of his day (he played afterwards for the "Gentlemen")' had not
been a contemporary of mine. I was not bad-looking either. I do not
mean I was handsome or anything of that sort; but I was tall and dark,
and my features were fairly regular, and, as I had more of a moustache
than almost any fellow in the school, I rather fancied myself.</p>

<p>After leaving Brighton College, my father got me a clerkship with
Lawrence, Loewenthal and Co., stockbrokers, of Copthall Court. My
father was rector of a Brighton parish, and knew Mr.Lawrence who came
regularly to his church. The two old boys were great "pals," because,
as my father said, they were both Protestants and not Catholics in
disguise; but I always thought that my father's liking for Mr.
Lawrence's port and Mr. Lawrence's respect for my father's birth and
learning had more to do with their mutual esteem. However that may be,
old Lawrence gave me a good start and I turned it to account. From the
first I took to business. The school work at Latin and Greek had had no
meaning for me; but in the City the tangible results of energy and
skill were always before me, interesting me in spite of myself, and
exciting me to do my best. And rivalry soon came to lend another spur.
In Throgmorton Street my chief competitors were young German Jews, keen
as mustard in everything relating to business, and preternaturally
sharp in scenting personal profit. Their acuteness and boldness
fascinated me: I went about with them a good deal, picked up
conversational German without much effort, and soon learned from my
mentors how fortunes were to be made. A little group of us pooled our
savings, and began to speculate and, after a succession of gains and
losses which about balanced themselves, turned our tens into hundreds
over a "slump" in American rails. Our success was due to
Waldstein&mdash;the Julius Waldstein who has since made a great
fortune, and whom I should like to write about some day or other, as I
look upon him as the first financial genius of the age. But now I must
get on with my story. It was a remark I made after this lucky "deal"
that drewMr. Lawrence's attention to me and gave me my first step up in
the house. I had gone into his private room with some transfers to be
signed. He was reading a letter; in the middle of it he rang for the
managing clerk, and asked him:</p>

<p>"How are Louisvilles going?"</p>

<p>"I'll see," was the reply; and in a minute or two old Simkins
returned with:</p>

<p>"Steady at 48."</p>

<p>I could not help muttering "They'll be steadier at 35."</p>

<p>"What do you know about it?" asked Lawrence, with an air of amused
surprise. His tone put me on my mettle, and I laid my reasons, or
rather Waldstein's, before him, and he soon saw that I knew what I was
talking about. A year afterwards, I, too, was a managing clerk and a
member of the Stock Exchange; and from that time on have never found it
very difficult to lay by something each year. It's curious, too, how
the habit of saving grows on one&mdash;but I am forgetting my
story.</p>

<p>As I became interested in my work and confident of success I wanted
some one to talk to, to brag to if the truth must be told, and life, I
have noticed, generally furnishes us with the opportunity of gratifying
our desires. I still kept up the custom of going home to Brighton from
Saturday till Monday. And one Sunday coming out of church my sister
introduced me to some people whom I took to immediately, Mrs. and Miss
Longden. Mabel Longden was tall and good-looking, but too dark for my
taste. Still, we chummed atonce, and perhaps got along together better
than if we had fallen in love at first sight&mdash;a thing, by the way,
which I have never believed in. Mrs. Longden was the widow of a major
in the army, and lived in a small house in Kemp Town. She had only a
hundred a year or so beyond her pension, and her one ambition in life
was to keep herself and her two daughters like ladies. Her love of
gentility was so passionate that when the rumour got about that she was
the daughter of a small tradesman, everyone believed it. Mabel had a
sister whom I have not mentioned yet, perhaps because I saw little of
her for some time, and the little I saw did not interest me. She could
not have been more than thirteen or fourteen years of age when I first
met her, and she seemed to me an ordinary schoolgirl&mdash;all ribs and
ankles. Her face was not even pretty; the eyes were all right, greyish
and large, but the nose was inclined to be thick and the oval of the
face was too narrow; the jaws seemed pinched in, and this peculiarity
gave her an uncomfortably sharp look. She was a strange child in every
way, and I did not like her. I remember the first time I really noticed
her. I had been talking to Mabel about business; telling her how I had
nabbed a fellow who had tried to cheat me, when suddenly I looked up
and found Blanche gazing at me. As our eyes met she looked away
quietly, and then got up and went out of the room, leaving me under the
impression that she disapproved of me, or did not like what I had been
saying. I put this down to "cheek" that deserved to be snubbed; but she
never gave me theopportunity of snubbing her; she seemed rather to
avoid me.</p>

<p>A few weeks later I was waiting one afternoon in the little parlour.
Mabel had gone up to dress to go out with me, when suddenly Blanche
came into the room with her cheeks aglow, crying, "Where's mother?" She
had been skating, and her sparkling eyes and rich colour so improved
her that I exclaimed, "Why, Blanche, you're quite pretty!" I suppose
the astonishment in my voice was rather marked; for as I looked her
eyes grew indignant; the colour in her cheeks flamed from pink to
scarlet, and she turned and stalked out of the room with her chin in
the air. An absurd child; she annoyed without interesting me, and I
resolved to take no further notice of her.</p>

<p>It was easy to keep that resolution; for about this time my
companionship with Mabel became close: we began to spoon in fact, and
soon tried to believe ourselves very much in love with each other. But
there was always something lacking in our intimacy, and now, looking
back, I see that there was no real bond between us, and I begin to
suspect that kisses often stand youth in lieu of sympathy. For even if
I would, I really could not tell much of my flirtation with Mabel
Longden. She was good to look at and good to be with, too uniformly
sweet-tempered ever to have cared much about me, I imagine; but I know
little of her true character and temperament; for love was not in her,
love with its terrible need of self-betrayal. There were moments, it is
true, when we seemed drawn together, moments when her eyes soughtmine
with timid abandonment, and when pride in her looks and pity of her
weakness grew in me to unselfish tenderness; but there was no enduring
strength in the feeling, no roots of life in it, and a few days'
separation chilled us both. I am glad now to think that the play was
pure comedy on both sides, though at the time I was often vaguely
disappointed with our aloofness from one another, and tried by dwelling
on her beauty to bring myself to the passionate ardour I ought to have
felt for her. Mabel never really loved me at all; at the height of our
intimacy I noticed that she used to lead me on to talk of the fortune I
should make, and of the great house we should have and the horses and
carriages, and it seems to me now, though I am half ashamed to say it,
that it was some picture in her mind of dress and jewelry and
distinction which made her try to like me. In any case the matter is
not worth thinking about any longer, and I only mention it now because
it belongs to my story.</p>

<p>I had known Mabel Longden for nearly two years, and for six or eight
months had spent three-fourths of the time I passed in Brighton, with
her, when I called early one Saturday evening and found that she was
out. I was a little hurt&mdash;more in vanity than in affection, I
think&mdash;and disappointed, which I took to be a proof of feeling,
whereas it was merely the result of balked habit. True, I was later
than usual, much later in fact; but then my father had kept me talking
of my younger brother Tom, and I had bought tickets for the opera to
make up for my late coming. Ifound it difficult to disguise my bad
humour when I was told that Mabel had gone out for the evening and
would probably not be home till eleven.</p>

<p>"You see," said Mrs. Longden apologetically, "you never sent her
word, and I presume she thought you were not coming at all." While she
was speaking, my eyes, wandering about in hesitation and annoyance,
suddenly caught sight of an expression of indignant contempt on
Blanche's face as she sat looking into the fire.</p>

<p>"But what am I to do with these tickets?" I asked, in helpless
irritation. As I spoke Blanche kicked the fender and got up hastily,
and an idea came into my head.</p>

<p>"Would you let me take Blanche?" and I turned to Mrs. Longden.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Longden after a moment's hesitation, only to be
noticed because of her unvarying suavity; "yes, certainly; and I think
Blanche would enjoy it. She loves music."</p>

<p>"Well, Blanche?" I asked; but there was no need of an answer, for
the girl's eyes were dancing.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said in a low voice, as if to excuse her joy, " it is 'Le
Nozze di Figaro' isn't it? and I love music, and Titiens and Trebelli
are both in it. Oh," and she drew in her breath with delight and
clasped her hands, "it is kind of you!"</p>

<p>"What will you wear, dear?" asked her mother, and the girl's face
fell so lugubriously that I could not help laughing. "Anything will do:
we must start at once," I said, and bustled them both upstairs. I like
music as much as most people, but I like, too, to talk between the
acts, and mycompanion that night was more than silent; still Titiens
was very good in spite of her bulk, and Trebelli the most enchanting
page that was ever seen. When she sang "Voi che sapete" with that
angelic voice of hers, I was carried off my feet.</p>

<p>As she finished the song my companion gave a queer, little,
hysterical squeak that turned all eyes upon her. I saw that the child
was overwrought; her face was pale and pinched, and the eyes blazing,
so I whispered, "Let us go, Blanche, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she said. " No! it is too beautiful&mdash;please, please
don't go."</p>

<p>"If we stay," I insisted, "you mustn't cry out; the people are all
looking at you."</p>

<p>"What do the people matter?" she snapped, and then, pleadingly,
"please, let me listen." Of course there was nothing more to be said,
and we stayed to the end.</p>

<p>It was a fine night, and we walked home together, Blanche taking my
arm.</p>

<p>"Are you glad I took you?" I asked, feeling that I should like her
to thank me; she pressed my arm. But I wanted to talk, so I went
on:</p>

<p>"You liked the play, didn't you?" That started her off; she was so
excited with enthusiasm and admiration that she talked like one out of
breath.</p>

<p>"The music," she said, "was divine; so beautiful, it hurt. I ache
with it still. I can never, never forget it."</p>

<p>I laughed at her exaggerations, and brought her down to common
sense, and then she began to attack the play.</p>

<p>"It was beastly," if you please; "all falsehood and deceit and
cheating. I hope life isn't like that," she burst out, "if it is, I
shall hate it. How could Mozart have given that lovely music to those
horrid words and horrid people? How could he?"</p>

<p>There seemed to be some sense in what she said, but as I knew very
little about it, I preferred to change the subject. And then the
conversation died away.</p>

<p>When we reached her house I left her at the door. Somehow or other I
did not feel inclined to go in and make up my little difference with
Mabel. It seems to me now as if our estrangement began that evening;
but, indeed, I did not trouble much about it, either then or later. And
it was not any affection for Blanche that put Mabel out of my head: no,
the child excited my curiosity, and that was all; she was evidently
clever, and I liked that; but she was also intensely emotional, which
seemed odd rather than pleasant to me.</p>

<p>For some weeks I did not call at the Longdens, and when I called I
noticed that Mabel was affected in manner and speech. Her coldness I
didn't mind; in fact, I felt relieved by it; but her graceful poses and
little slang phrases of gentility seemed ridiculous to me. I wondered
that I had never been disagreeably impressed by them before. I felt,
too, that they were characteristic of her; she was affected and vain. I
did not want to be alone with her, and though we spent several
afternoons together I maintained my attitude of polite carelessness.
Mabel scarcely seemed to notice my change of manner; she was often out
when Icalled, and I fell upon the idea of asking Blanche to accompany
us whenever Mabel happened to go out with me. At first Blanche used to
refuse point blank; but as I returned to the charge she consented now
and then, evidently in accord with her sister; indeed, Mabel often
pressed her to say "Yes."</p>

<p>I remember one Saturday evening taking them both to dine at
Mutton's. We had a private room and the best dinner the place could
afford; for success and Waldstein's example were teaching me to be
extravagant in such matters. The week had been a red-letter one for me;
I had cleared a thousand pounds in it and naturally was cock-a-hoop,
though I did not conceal from myself, or even from the Longdens, that
my success was due to Waldstein. In fact, towards the end of the dinner
I set his whole plan before them and gave all his reasons for the
course he took. Before I had got half through the story it was
impossible not to notice that Blanche was my only listener. Mabel made
polite exclamations of attention at the proper places; but she was
manifestly rather bored by the account, whereas Blanche asked about
everything she didn't understand, and appeared to be really engrossed
by the dramatic elements in the struggle for wealth. Piqued by Mabel's
manner, I did my best to interest Blanche and succeeded, I suppose, for
Mabel at length left the table and took to drumming on the window pane
to show her impatience.</p>

<p>"I must go!" she exclaimed at last. "I expect Captain Burroughs to
call this evening to tryover a song with me, and I don't want to be
late." After that there was nothing left for us but to put on our wraps
and go. I had met Captain Burroughs at the Longdens more than once, but
had not paid much attention to him. He was an ordinary-looking man, I
thought, with nothing particular about him except that he was well
set-up and had large blue eyes. Now as Mabel spoke his image came
before me, and I understood that he was good-looking, that she thought
him exceedingly attractive, and had more than consoled herself with his
courtship for my inattention. Perhaps even she had begun to go her own
way before I had thought of going mine. Yes, she had; a hundred little
signs unnoticed at the time assured me that she had. The discovery
relieved and pleased me greatly; I grew excited and felt quite cordial
to her. She was a fine girl after all, and deserved a handsome husband
like Burroughs. Was it this elation or the wine I had drunk that made
me act as I did? I don't know; the bare facts are not flattering to me,
but I'll set them down. Mabel went out of the room first, as if in a
hurry to get to her Captain; she disappeared just as I took up
Blanche's jacket to help her on with it. As the young girl swung round
before me I noticed for the first time that she had a figure, a figure
that promised to be a very pretty one, and after putting on her jacket
I could not help taking her slender waist in my hands. Of course I said
something to cover my action: "Go along, let us catch Mabel," or
something of that sort; but the words died on my lips, for she
turnedabruptly and faced me with an imperative: "Don't!"</p>

<p>"Go along," I repeated awkwardly, "you're only a child."</p>

<p>She moved away haughtily, without a word, and followed her sister
downstairs.</p>

<p>The cab was waiting for us, and as soon as we were seated in it I
forced a conversation with Mabel on the subject of her song and Captain
Burroughs' voice.</p>

<p>After this incident Blanche avoided me persistently. At first,
feeling rather uncomfortable, I was not at all sorry to get out of a
complete explanation. But as the feeling of shame wore off I began to
contrive occasions for being alone with her. "I don't care for her," I
used to say to myself, "but I don't want her to think me a howling
cad." But though I did not care for her she was in my thoughts a good
deal, and knew how to pique my vanity at least by continually avoiding
me. She was more successful in this than she could have been a few
months before; for now I never went to the house without finding
Burroughs in the little parlour on the ground floor, filling the place
I had formerly occupied beside Mabel. In fact, about this time Mrs.
Longden confided to me that the pair were engaged, and when I
congratulated Mabel I noticed that she was prettier and less affected
than I had ever imagined she could be. Love is like youth for hiding
faults and setting off merits. After this event my chances of meeting
Blanche alone became too slight to be worth the risk of disturbing the
lovers,and so I gave up going to the house at all regularly. Mere
chance soon helped me where purpose had failed. One afternoon late, as
I reached the house I found the servant at the door, who told me that
every one was out except Miss Blanche. I was very glad to hear it.
Blanche was in the parlour alone, and as I entered she stood up
hastily, and returned my greeting with a cold "I'll see if mother or
Mabel is in." But I stopped in front of the door, and said:</p>

<p>"Won't you speak to me, Blanche? If I've offended you, I beg your
pardon. Forgive me, and let us be friends again." I caught myself
speaking with an intensity far greater than I had thought of using;
and, as her face did not relax and she kept her eyes obstinately bent
on the ground, I began again with an extraordinary eagerness:</p>

<p>"Why will you bear malice? I had no idea you could be so cross. Just
remember what a great talk we had that night, and forgive me." Still
the same silence and little downcast face, scarcely to be seen in the
gathering shadows. I began again: "Really, Blanche, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself. It is childish to sulk so: yes, childish," I
repeated, for she had looked up at last. "If you were older you would
know that every woman forgives when the man apologizes and asks for
pardon." She looked me straight in the face, but said nothing. Had I
excited myself by my own pleading, or what was it? I don't know; but I
began again in a different tone:</p>

<p>"Upon my word, if you won't speak, I'll treatyou like the little
girl you are, and kiss you into a good temper."</p>

<p>"You daren't," she said, and stood rigidly.</p>

<p>"You mustn't dare me," I cried, and I threw my left arm round her
waist, and held her face to mine with my right hand. At first she
struggled desperately, and writhed so that I could hardly hold her.
Then gradually I overcame her struggles, and kissed her again and
again. I shall never be able to describe the strange, keen pleasure I
took in the touch of her lips; nor the intimate, intense delight it
gave me to hold her tender, panting form against my breast in the
darkness. Whilst I was still embracing and kissing her, the idea came
to me that her resistance had become merely formal; that she was not
trying to avoid my lips. At once conscience smote me, and I felt that I
had been a brute. No sort of excuse for me&mdash;none. I pulled myself
together, and stopped kissing her. Then I began pleading again.</p>

<p>"Little Blanche, have you forgiven me? Are we friends again? Won't
you speak to me now?" And I laid my cheek to hers: the girl's face was
wet, and I realized with a pang that she was crying silently. This was
worse than I had feared. I was genuinely grieved.</p>

<p>"Oh, Blanche," I exclaimed, "if you knew how sorry I am! Please
don't cry; I didn't mean to hurt you; I'm so sorry&mdash;what am I to
do? I'll never, never forgive myself." As I began to speak she slipped
from my arms and went to the door.</p>

<p>"Blanche," I went on&mdash;for I couldn't let her go like
that&mdash;"you must hate me to leave me so;won't you say you'll
forgive me, please?" She paused, holding the door ajar; then I heard
her say in a little subdued voice,</p>

<p>"There's nothing to forgive," and then "It wasn't your fault," and
the door closed behind her quickly, leaving me in the dark, half
penitent and half in doubt as to her meaning, though the tone of her
voice had partially reassured me. After she left me I seemed to be
possessed by a demon of unrest. Up and down the parade I tramped
reproaching myself for what I had done. I had no business to kiss her.
It was a shame. I felt very clearly that kisses meant infinitely more
to her than they did to her sister. What was I to do? I didn't love
her, and yet I had never kissed anyone with such passion. She was an
inscrutable mystery to me. Why had she cried? Did she dislike me? Had
she grown tired of struggling, or merely affected to struggle, wishing
all the time to be kissed? This flattering hypothesis seemed to be
true; but, if true, why had she begun to cry? And if she had cried out
of vexation, why did she say that there was nothing to forgive, and
that it wasn't my fault? I couldn't read the riddle; and it was too
fascinating to leave unread. I wanted to return to the house to see her
if but for a moment, but that went against my pride. I resolved to
write to her. The girl was a mystery, and the mystery had an attraction
for me that I could not account for nor explain. That night I went up
to my little bedroom and sat down to write to her. I soon found that
the task was exceedingly difficult. At one moment I waswriting as if I
loved her, and the next I was warning her that I did not love her yet.
At length I began to quiet myself: "Why write at all?" But I couldn't
leave her without a word, and so I decided at last to write just a
brief note, saying how grieved I should be to hurt or offend her in any
way, and declaring that I would call next Saturday afternoon as soon as
I reached Brighton. I began "Dear little Blanche," and ended up with "I
shall think of you all through the week; yours, Will Rutherford."</p>

<p>The week passed much as other weeks had passed, with this difference
however, that from Monday on I began to look forward more and more
eagerly to seeing Blanche again. I did not write this to her in the
meantime, partly out of prudence, partly out of the wish to tell it to
her when we met. As soon as I reached Brighton on the Saturday I
hurried off to the Longdens. The mother met me in the parlour.</p>

<p>"Where's Blanche?" I asked, gaily.</p>

<p>"Blanche!" repeated Mrs. Longden, with a slight tone of surprise;
"she has gone into the country to stay with some friends."</p>

<p>"Into the country," I muttered, in confusion; "where to?"</p>

<p>"Near Winchester," came the calm reply.</p>

<p>"But did she leave no message for me&mdash;no letter?"</p>

<p>"Not that I'm aware of," replied Mrs. Longden, smilingly; "I didn't
even know that you took interest enough in each other to write or send
messages.</p>

<p>And that was all. I left the house more bewildered than ever; but my
pride was up in arms, and I resolved to put Blanche out of my mind
completely. That seemed easy enough at first; but with time it became
increasingly difficult. The mystery puzzled me more and more, and the
abrupt parting piqued my curiosity. As the weeks passed and I recalled
all our meetings and what she had said, I began to see that she was
very intelligent and very ingenuous. At length I couldn't stand it any
longer; so I wrote to her, telling her how constantly I thought of her,
and begging her to let me see her. I took the letter to Mrs. Longden,
who promised to forward it, with a request to Blanche to answer it, and
next week Mrs. Longden showed me the end of a letter Blanche had
written to her: "I received the letter you sent me; please tell him
there's no answer. I have nothing to say."</p>

<p>I had gone as far as my pride would allow. From that day I never
went near the Longdens, but gave myself up to work, and gradually the
fascination of business took hold of me once again. Four or five years
later I married and bought a little country place near Winchester. A
year or so afterwards I took my wife to a ball given by the officers of
the Hussars, who were quartered in the Cathedral city. I knew a good
many people, and, as I liked dancing, prepared to enjoy myself; feeling
sure that my wife would be well taken care of. After the second or
third dance, a Captain Wolfe come up to me and said, "You're in luck,
my friend; I'm going tointroduce you to the belle of the ball." With
some laughing protestation I followed him and he presented me by simply
saying "This is Mr. Rutherford."</p>

<p>The girl certainly deserved his praise; she was one of those
bewitchingly pretty girls one sees now and then in England and nowhere
else in the world. I cannot describe her except by saying that she was
above the middle height and of a very perfect lissom figure, with the
most dazzingly beautiful face I have ever seen.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," I said, "but Captain Wolfe forgot to tell me your
name."</p>

<p>"Don't you know it?" she asked, while her blue eyes danced with
amusement.</p>

<p>"No," I replied, "how should I? I have never seen you before."</p>

<p>I spoke with absolute conviction.</p>

<p>"What a bad compliment&mdash;to forget me and deny me! Aren't you
ashamed of yourself?" and she pouted adorably.</p>

<p>"The best of compliments," I retorted warmly; "the certainty that if
I had ever seen you I could never have forgotten you."</p>

<p>She swept me a low courtesy, and then, with sudden gravity, "Allow
me to introduce myself, Miss Blanche Longden that was, now Miss
Longden."</p>

<p>I was dumbfounded. The grace, the charm, the self-possession, I
could understand, even the fine figure: but not the change in face.
Blanche's nose had been rather heavy and shapeless, and now it was
daintily cut; the pointed chin was rounded,the oval of the face had
filled out, the eyes had surely grown darker, the complexion that had
been muddy was now like exquisite porcelain; but even these
extraordinary changes did not account for her entrancing loveliness. I
was lost in wonder.</p>

<p>She laughed in a pleased way at my embarrassment:</p>

<p>"You don't recognize me even now?"</p>

<p>"No," I confessed ruefully. "You are altogether changed: even your
voice has improved beyond recognition." .</p>

<p>"Let us sit down," she said, "and talk, if you have this dance
free;" and I sat down, careless whether I was free or not. At last I
should get the mystery solved. What did we talk about? At first the
usual things. Her sister, I learned, was married and had three
children. She was in India now with her husband, and Mrs. Longden, in
Brittany, was taking care of the little ones. At last I put my
question:</p>

<p>"Why did you go away from Brighton, and never answer my
letters?"</p>

<p>"I did answer them. Mother told me she showed you my answer."</p>

<p>"That was no answer. You have no idea how disappointed and hurt I
was; how I grieved over your silence." I could not help being much more
intense with this girl than I had any right to be. "But tell me why you
left me so, and I'll forgive you."</p>

<p>She seemed to consider, and then:</p>

<p>"I don't know; there <em>was</em> nothing to be said;"and then, "You
are married, aren't you?" I nodded; she went on: "I want to know your
wife; you must introduce me."</p>

<p>"With pleasure," I replied: "but my answer; you will explain the
mystery now."</p>

<p>"But you must have understood?"</p>

<p>"No; I did not, I assure you, and even now I can't make out why you
acted as you did."</p>

<p>"How strange!" And she laughed, looking away from me. On reflection
afterwards, it seemed to me that this laughter of hers was a trifle
forced; but I may be mistaken. At the time I didn't remark the false
note. How strange!" she repeated; and then, with sudden gravity, "Shall
I dot the '<i>i</i>s ' and cross the '<i>t</i>s' for you, and confess?
I wonder will it be good for my soul. The truth is very simple, and yet
very hard to tell. I loved you. Oh! as a child, of course, I mean, but
with an ideal passion. You never guessed it? I'm glad. Do you know, I
think it began that night at the theatre. You won something of the
charm of that fatal music that seemed to me the voice of my soul's
desire. It transformed me; the tide of it swept through me, and ebbed
and flowed in me, and bore me away out upon it till the sweet tears
scalded my eyes and made my heart ache. After that my guard broke down
before you; the way was open and you took possession of the empty
throne. How I loved you! I invested you with every grace and every
power; you were the lay figure and I the artist. Forgive me, I don't
mean to hurt you; but that's the truth. You brought the wild fresh air
of struggle and triumph intoour close narrow life, and I made a hero of
you, that was all.</p>

<p>"I think I began by pitying you; even in short frocks some of us are
mothers. I saw that Mabel didn't love you and was indignant with her.
After seeing her with you my heart has ached for you, and I've gone out
of the room hating her make-believe of love and stopped in the hall to
talk to your coat. How I used to kiss and stroke it and put my cheek
against it and whisper sweet things to it! 'Tell him, dear coat,' I
used to say, 'that I love him, and he mustn't be sad or lonely. Tell
him&mdash;tell him that I love him.' I used to believe that
unconsciously you must receive some comfort from those assurances.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the dinner when you touched me? I stopped you; I
was so glad at heart that I had to pretend to be angry for fear you'd
understand. And that afternoon when you kissed me; I provoked
it&mdash;on purpose? I don't know. I do know that I resisted as long as
I could, and when I could resist no longer, you stopped. How the
passion of shame hurt me then! I thought I should die of it, and then I
thought of the sweet unknown affection I had been giving you&mdash;all
past and at an end&mdash;and the tears came. . . . Well, there's my
confession. You see now that I could not answer your letters. I had to
win back self-respect, and I did."</p>

<p align="center" class="cen">* * * * *</p>

<p> </p>

<p>There; that's all the story. I know I've told it badly, but I've
done my best. What did I say toher? I played the fool. I could find
nothing sensible to say; I held my head in my hands and muttered:</p>

<p>"And now?"</p>

<p>"And now," she repeated, smiling through wet eyes, "I'm grown up and
you're married, and I want to know your wife."</p>

<p>"And that's all?" I blundered on.</p>

<p>"All?" she said; "all&mdash;and enough too, I should think." Her
voice had changed and grown hard; even as a girl she was
quick-tempered: "Do you know I look at you and can't tell what
possessed me, what I could have seen in you? You're not even like the
mental picture I had made of you. I don't know how I could have dressed
you up in those heroic vestments. When I look at you I wonder at
myself. I must really ask your wife what she sees in you;
for&mdash;"</p>

<p>At last I came to sense; the beautiful play was over, and I had
offended her; but she had gone too far in punishment: the words came to
me:</p>

<p>"If you go on hurting me, I shall think you are daring me
again."</p>

<p>The blood surged to the roots of her hair; she rose and took the arm
of a man who had just come up, and vanished from my sight; and with her
going romance died out of my life, and the grey walls of the ordinary
shrank round and hemmed me in for ever.</p>

<p>In the years that have elapsed since, my business instincts have
often forced me to try and strike a balance: I was richer by a
wonderful memory andpoorer by the sense of incalculable loss. Sometimes
I try to console myself with the thought that perhaps that is all life
holds, even for the luckiest of us.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_4">PROFIT AND LOSS</a></h3>

<p> </p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_5">I</a></h3>

<p class="l">THE great dry-goods store was silent and shadowful. A
misty light glimmering through the frosted glass of a little office at
the back discovered dimly the lines of counters stretching away into
the darkness and the spectral grey-brown hangings which hid the shelves
of goods. In the office a man sat working amid a pile of account-books.
He was very young&mdash;to judge by his thin, dark moustache not more
than two or three and twenty years of age, but the vertical lines
between his eyebrows and a certain hardness of compressed lips made him
appear five years older. David Tryon was not to be called good-looking,
though his features were sharply cut and for the most part regular, and
his dark eyes intent with purpose. His ugliest trait, a long square
chin, deepened the impression made by brow and eyes and imparted to his
face a character of extraordinary resolution. As he laid down his pen
and closed the ledger he had been using, an expression of complete
lassitude came over his tensely-strung features; he was evidently
exhausted. The July day had been excessively hot, and the summer
stock-taking had made his labour as cashier very heavy. For a week past
he hadworked eighteen hours out of every twenty-four, and now he had
just completed the annual statement and drawn out the profit and loss
account. This task was supposed to take about a month, but Tryon knew
that his principal had some special reason for wishing to ascertain as
soon as possible how his affairs stood, and accordingly he had
overworked himself, as ambitious young men of a nervous, bilious
temperament are apt to do. He was so worn out that he could scarcely
think; sleepiness seemed to blunt and numb his senses. He didn't notice
the opening of the office-door, and he started when he felt a hand laid
upon his shoulder and found himself face to face with his chief, Mr.
Jefferson Boulger. Tryon was greatly surprised. Mr. Boulger lived in
the country, and it was most unusual to see him in the store at ten
o'clock at night.</p>

<p>"Been working hard as usual, Dave," said his employer pleasantly, as
the young man started to his feet and roughly brushed his hair back
with his hand as if to drive away his weariness.</p>

<p>"I guess it'll worry you to get out the balance-sheet this
year&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"It has cost some work," Tryon replied, "but it's done now and the
statement of profit and loss as well."</p>

<p>"You don't say! I reckoned 'twould take another week at least. But
you're real smart at figures, and as I was in town I thought I'd look
in on the chance"&mdash;here Mr. Boulger as if correcting himself added
hastily, "That is, I s'posed you'd know about how we stood, and anyway
I'd have atalk with you. Is that it?" and he pointed to a sheet of
foolscap on the desk.</p>

<p>"That's it," Tryon answered, handing the paper to his chief.</p>

<p>Mr. Boulger had a large experience of life and some quickness of
perception, but he was not a good enough actor at this moment to
conceal his emotion. Though he turned sideways half-hiding his face as
if to read the statement by the lamp, his nervousness was manifest. In
truth, he had good reason for anxiety.</p>

<p>Mr. Boulger was a handsome man&mdash;tall and well-formed, with
regular features, large blue eyes, and fair moustache. In spite of his
fifty-five years he seemed to be in his prime; life had always been
easy to him; his good looks had made it easy. They had won for him when
still a young man a wife with money and connections, and this
circumstance had transformed him from a clerk into the owner of a
business at the time when Kansas City began to grow with such rapidity
that almost every use of capital brought large profits. Mr. Boulger was
sufficiently vain of his person, but he was far vainer of his
intelligence. He ascribed all his success in life to his ability; the
extraordinary chances which had favoured him, never entered into his
thoughts. It had, however, been borne in upon him lately that the
prosperity of his business was anything but assured. The causes of this
phenomenon lay beyond his powers of vision. The truth was that the
growth of Kansas City had begun to attract attention throughout the
Union. Capitalists from Eastern cities had flocked in andestablished
business-houses on a scale formerly unknown in the Western town. And
Mr. Boulger had not kept pace with these new competitors, while for
reasons which will soon be set forth, his expenses, always large, had
of late been very largely increased. For some time past he had been
short of money; he was now embarrassed for want of it; and a series of
novel and unpleasant experiences had, at length, made him anxious.
Hence his excitement when he took up the statement which must show his
exact position. Mechanically he turned over the pages without seeing
the figures, though pretending to scan them closely, but when he came
to the nett results his surprise and fear overcame his prudence:</p>

<p>"A million! A million of goods here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tryon, as if following the thread of the elder man's
thought. "The buyers this year have been&mdash;unlucky; the silk and
velvet patterns have not gone off well, and in the cotton goods
Marchants have taken nearly all the trade away from us by cutting
prices, and so the balance is bad."</p>

<p>"Bad," repeated Mr. Boulger, while his blue eyes dilated with
mingled fear and anger. "Bad. I reckon 'tis bad. I don't see how it
could be much worse. The buyers must go. They ain't worth their salt.
Why, we sold more than this, fifteen years ago, when a hundred thousand
dollars would have bought up the whole place. Bad," and his voice rose
passionately, "the salesmen must be bad too. I don't believe," he went
on, bringing his shapely hand down on the desk with a thump inhis
excitement, "I don't believe there's a man in the place does his work
properly&mdash;of course except you, Dave."</p>

<p>"That ain't quite so," Tryon objected. "The salesmen are fairly
good, and they do their best. But the buyers don't seem to know what
the folk out here want, and there's no one to put them right."</p>

<p>"It's just too bad," resumed Mr. Boulger, who seemed to have
overheard Tryon's concluding words. "Too bad. Year after year the stock
gets larger, and these last four or five years the sales have been
fallin' off. Why, I remember when I first took over the place. I ran
the sales up year after year, and the stock remained about the same.
Then I extended the business; made this the biggest dry-goods house in
all the West; and still we used to be short of stock often. Now it
seems as if nothin' would go&mdash;nothin'. . . . I wish I'd had a son
to take my place. No business goes well unless the head's there all the
time, and since that fever four years ago I've not been able to stick
to work as I used to do. I guess that's got something to do with it. I
wish I'd had a son. But there! I believed the store would run itself;
it always seemed so easy to make things go well; and then I thought
that you, Dave, would look after everything. Why, since I first took
you in, I've just pushed you right along till you've got the best place
in the house, and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You forget, Mr. Boulger, that when I advised Williams three years
ago what to buy, he went to you, and you told me to mind my own
businessand not to interfere with the buying. But even now," Tryon went
on, with keen decision in his voice, "it's not too late to alter. I'll
undertake, if you give me the power, to clear out a quarter, at least,
of this stock within the year." (Mr. Boulger made a gesture of
hopelessness.) "I mean at fair prices. Of course, there'd be a loss,
but not much. Though I'd rather realise three-quarters of the stock for
what it would bring, and then start fresh&mdash;most of it's out of
fashion. There's no reason why the business shouldn't go better than
ever it has gone. For though Marchants are smart competitors, the
town's growing very fast, and there's room enough for us all."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but not time enough, Dave, not time enough." And then, as
if taking up a new train of thought, and abandoning his despairing
meditation, Mr. Boulger laid his hand on Tryon's shoulder, and went on
earnestly:</p>

<p>"I've been kind to you, Dave, and I guess you won't go back on me
now. No, I'm sure you won't. Well, time's what we want&mdash;time and
money. You're surprised. It seems strange, don't it? but it's true. My
home costs a good deal; I've always lived well. And when Milly was
married I had to fit her out. I put up the house for her and all that,
and gave her a good many thousand dollars besides. I don't hold with
the Yankee idea that daughters should go empty-handed to their
husbands. And Mrs. Boulger and the younger girls spent a pile in
Europe. I guess livin's dear there. And they had to make some sort of a
show. Any way, I'm very short now. There's no doubt aboutthat. Stewart
wants a large cheque to clear his account, and I don't like to try to
borrow from the bank here&mdash;even if they'd lend it. I don't know
why I talk to you like this, Dave; but I guess you know about how
matters stand, and I've always liked you. You know that, . . .</p>

<p>"I didn't realise at first how the business was goin'. I had kinder
got used to success, and took things too easily, hopin' for better
times; and now, just when I had made up my mind to work again&mdash;you
may have noticed I've come regularly to business this last
month&mdash;it's too late. There's a million on these shelves, and I'm
pressed, worried for a hundred thousand dollars. It's too bad!"</p>

<p>"But can't you sell your real estate, Mr. Boulger, and your trotting
horses? I don't mean your house, but the farms and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Boulger shook his head mournfully.</p>

<p>"I've done everything, Dave. The real estate is mortgaged, and if I
sold my trottin' horses every one would talk and my credit would be
gone. No," he added, shortly, "that's not the way." Then, after a
pause, during which his fine eyes had taken in the young man's
excitement and a certain pained, embarrassed look on the nervous face,
he repeated, "That's no good." The silence that ensued was painful to
Tryon; evidently he was at a loss what to advise.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Boulger asked, as if the thought had just come into his
head.</p>

<p>"What's the place insured for? A million at least, ain't it?</p>

<p>"About that, I think, but it's placed in so manydifferent companies
that I couldn't tell exactly without looking it up in the books."</p>

<p>"That ain't necessary," Mr. Boulger went on; "I don't put all my
eggs in one basket. It would be worth while for any Insurance Office to
contest a claim of a million, but when a loss is small, an Insurance
Company prefers to pay up promptly." The look of comprehension which
came over Tryon's face at this remark stimulated the vanity of the
older man, who went on complacently: "Besides, I guess you'll find the
London, Liverpool and Globe is down for the largest amount, and it sort
o' way consoles Americans when foreigners lose more than they do. I
haven't lost all business sense yet, I reckon. Any way I feel certain
that if the place burnt down I'd get every cent of the insurance money.
An' think what that would do, Dave; 'twould set us all 0. K. again. A
million. I wish the store would catch fire an' burn right out. I'd give
a hundred thousand dollars to get rid of all that stock&mdash;an' be
glad to do it." Here Mr. Boulger paused significantly as if inviting an
answer. But Tryon didn't speak, couldn't speak indeed, though it was
manifest that he had fully grasped his principal's meaning.</p>

<p>Tryon's parentage and training had been peculiar. He had never known
his father, who had die when he was still a young child. He had been
brought up entirely by his mother, and a better nurture in some
respects no boy ever enjoyed; for Mrs. Tryon was one of those rare
persons whose good qualities inspire affectionate admiration. Before
her marriage she had been a schoolmistressin Hanley, Vermont, and when
her husband died, a few years after their emigration to Missouri, she
returned to her old occupation with an eagerness that testified
eloquently to the trials of her married life. Of these she never spoke,
even to her son. She talked to Dave of his father's brains and
quickness; but she seemed to have forgotten the fits of drunkenness
that had turned her life into a martyrdom of shame. Her energy and
optimism made her school-work enjoyable to her, but, curiously enough,
she attributed her success as a teacher, not to her moral qualities,
not to the sound judgment, amiability, and firmness which she possessed
in an eminent degree, but to her intelligence. She had always been
"smart and spry," she thought proudly, and it was perhaps the cruellest
disappointment of her life to find that her son Dave was not "smart."
She had, however, endowed him with not a little of her own strength of
character, and when he was about thirteen, he found with surprise that
he was gradually out-stripping boys whom for years he had regarded as
cleverer than himself. This consciousness brought about a revulsion in
his nature; stubborn humility gave place to eager pride, and under the
impulse of this new feeling, he redoubled his exertions at a time when
most of his school-fellows, quickening with the passions and hopes of
approaching manhood, began to lose interest in the routine of lessons.
It was one of the sweetest moments in his life when his mother declared
with glad tears that he had completely outgrown her assistance. About
this time, on the very threshold ofyouth, Dave met Miss Georgie
Boulger. She entered the high-school as a girl of fourteen, when he was
on the point of leaving it at sixteen, with the reputation of having
easily surpassed all his competitors. But he had never spoken first to
a girl in his life, and it never entered his head to speak to Miss
Georgie Boulger who wore a fur cloak, and was accompanied to and from
school by a negro servant. It was not her social superiority, however,
which won Tryon, although undoubtedly it attracted him, but Georgie's
aplomb and talkativeness and, above all, her kindness to him. She spoke
to him first about a difficulty in a lesson, and seemed grateful for
the help which he bashfully offered. The pair soon became fast friends.
Miss Georgie's girlish vanity was gratified by her conquest. The
strength of Tryon's character, his pride and gratitude, were all
enlisted on the side of his affection. He no more let his thoughts
wander from the young girl than he would have dreamed of giving up a
problem unsolved. Success, he had found out, came by perseverance, and,
as usual, the effort required for success&mdash;all the sacrifices it
demanded&mdash;served to increase his desire. When his mother,
delighted with his steadiness and boyish triumphs, pressed him to
continue his studies, and go to the university, he wouldn't hear of it.
He'd try to get a place in Boulger's store; she had worked long enough
for him; he wanted to help her now; and at last the mother, touched to
the heart by the devotion which she had given, but never expected to
receive, yielded.</p>

<p>Tryon took up his work in the store as he had studied in school,
with the difference that now he made light of difficulties which he
felt sure of his own power to overcome. In a very few months Mr.
Boulger learned to appreciate his assistant cashier, who certainly knew
more about the stock and business than anyone else in the place. And
when three or four years later, his chief cashier and manager, Mr.
Curtis, died suddenly, Mr. Boulger at once offered his place to Tryon,
with a salary of a hundred and fifty dollars a month. But when he found
that this advancement only intensified his young cashier's energy and
devotion, instead of further increasing his salary he began to treat
him with a great show of kindness, and at last got into the habit of
frequently inviting him to come out to his house and spend the night.
There Tryon renewed acquaintance with Miss Georgie, who responded to
his advances with the old kindliness and laughing good temper, touched
to a keener issue by a certain maidenly sense of what courtship meant.
Tryon had vastly improved in manner and bearing in the five years which
had passed since he left school, and though he was not fully conscious
of this, or of the natural effect upon a girl's nature of an assured
and resolute self-possession, Miss Georgie noted and admired the
change. Tryon felt simply that his perseverance was again meeting with
its reward; he had but to work he thought and he'd reach this goal,
too, when the news came that the Boulger girls with their mother were
going for a trip to Europe.</p>

<p>Then for the first time since his boyhood herealised the full
bitterness of failure, intensified in this case by the hopes of success
which he had cherished. But with the years his character had grown in
strength, and as soon as he had said farewell he turned again to his
work with renewed vigour. Hadn't Georgie, in reply to his expressed
fear that in Europe she'd forget old friends, laughed up in his face
with the words, "Anyway, I won't forget you, Mr. Tryon"? That was hope
enough for his persistent and steadfast nature. And when the trip of
six months lengthened to a year, and when the year became two, his
hopes grew with his own growth in self-confidence. The fact was always
there that Miss Georgie was still unmarried, and that encouraged
him.</p>

<p>In the years which Tryon had passed in Boulger's, there had taken
place that change in the business which has already been noticed.
Naturally enough Tryon was the first to feel the keener competition,
and to realise the necessity of meeting it by increased exertions. But
here he found himself thwarted by his chief. The influence which each
of these men exercised upon the other was anything but happy. Just at
the time when Mr. Boulger began to feel that he deserved rest, Tryon's
energy and ability rendered it unnecessary for him to occupy himself
actively in the store. Mr. Boulger, too, had found that Tryon knew more
about the business than he did, and this consciousness, while giving
him freedom, irritated his restless vanity. When Tryon came to him with
suggestions he assented to them with difficulty, even when he
understood their value and importance,but whenever he could, without
manifestly injuring the business, he waved the young man's proposals
loftily, or even contemptuously aside. Tryon, he felt, was inclined "to
play boss." His prolonged absence from business made it impossible for
Mr. Boulger to understand the changing conditions of trade, and so it
came about that while unable himself to make head against his new
competitors, he wouldn't allow Tryon to do his best to stem the tide.
The business went from bad to worse. It would be difficult to describe
Tryon's continual, resolute efforts to constrain fortune. All was in
vain; Mr. Boulger's jealousy of him foiled his best plans. Still what
he could do he did, and at length, to brighten his almost hopeless
labour, came the news that Mrs. Boulger and her daughters had returned
home. But weeks passed, and still his employer didn't invite him to his
house, and so the temptation came to Tryon at a moment when he was cast
down in spirit by the fear that his efforts to better the business had
lost him Mr. Boulger's liking, and with it all chance of winning his
daughter, Georgie.</p>

<p>If Mr. Boulger had been gifted with omniscience he could hardly have
chosen a fitter moment for his proposal. And yet when he spoke Tryon
kept silent. The plan suggested by his chief shocked him. His first
movement was one of instinctive, passionate recoil. But he had laboured
incessantly, with all nerves strung, for years, in order to bring
himself nearer to Georgie; and he curbed his first impulse of
indignation, fearing that if he gave way to it, his path to her wouldbe
blocked for ever. And once his honest instincts were held in silence,
the issue of the struggle was not doubtful. If it is true that one's
actions gradually change the character, it is also true that thoughts
and desires long persisted in, modify the texture of the mind. From
childhood David Tryon had been trained to think chiefly of success. The
triumphs of successful endeavour had hitherto been his chief pleasures;
how was he now to give up all that was delightful to him in life when
he had never so much as contemplated the possibility of such
renunciation? Having conquered the first movement of revolt, the
intoxication of an immediate triumph overpowered him. He did not dwell
long upon the condition; he had been trained in a school of life which
judges by results, and is little scrupulous as to means. He could not
help feeling that an opportunity now presented itself to him which
might never come again, an opportunity which opened a broad road to the
object of his desires. It was not the money-bribe which tempted him as
much as the escape from a harassed and fettered activity into a wide
field of free effort, and&mdash;Georgie. Yet&mdash;</p>

<p>While Tryon stood to all appearance impassive and thoughtful Mr.
Boulger grew impatient. He felt that he had gone too far to recede; he
must go on and take the risk of refusal. Tryon's silence must mean
consent. Besides, his position was desperate and this last throw, even
if it failed, would leave him no worse off than he had been before
speaking. No one, he thought, would believe Tryon's word against his.
But evidently he mustbid higher&mdash;that was plain. So he began again
in a strained voice:</p>

<p>"Dave, you see I trust you, and a hundred thousand dollars or say a
hundred and fifty thousand ain't to be won every day. What do you say?"
Then impatience mastered him, and he added,</p>

<p>"Will you do it? That's the point. You ain't afraid, I know, and the
risk ain't anythin', but will you?"</p>

<p>The words, the manner, the impatient eagerness of the voice recalled
Tryon's business wits. Often in his school days his slowness in
grasping the full import of a question had stood him in good stead, and
as the slowness changed to quickness of apprehension by dint of effort
and concentrated attention, he had made it a habit to think carefully
before he spoke, having again and again realised the advantages of
second thoughts. Accordingly, though his heart was beating fast and
hard, he held the question before him and forced himself to consider it
in all its bearings, understanding that his silence had already induced
Mr. Boulger to increase his offer and that to take time might well
serve him in more ways than one. Besides, at the bottom of his heart he
hated the proposal. Was there no other way? Yet he must not offend
Georgie's father. If only&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you'd renew that bill of Stewart's for thirty days and give me a
free hand here, we could have a clearance sale that would meet the bill
and give us money to go on with. This store's a fortune. The other
thing's foolish."</p>

<p>"The bill has been renewed twice and they won't renew it again, and
the bank won't take it up&mdash;I'm in debt to the bank. Dave, there's
no other way out&mdash;not one. Will you take a hundred and fifty
thousand dollars and set me on my feet again&mdash;that's the
question?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather work and wait. Crime&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw!" And Mr. Boulger laughed noisily to conceal his
agitation. "There ain't no risk. With your head, Dave, one don't get
caught, and a man can work and wait a long time before he gets a
hundred and fifty thousand dollars. You know that as well as I do."</p>

<p>"The risk's there and I hate it; 'tisn't needed. Besides, your
promise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, Dave, I guess you can trust me&mdash;I don't go back on my
word, you know that. I've shown you, I reckon, that I like you and
think a heap of you. Of course I'd pay what I say I would." Mr. Boulger
spoke with the accents of an almost affectionate reproach. He was
evidently feverishly anxious.</p>

<p>"Do you mean a promissory note-three months after date? "</p>

<p>"Dave, I can't do that. You might die or&mdash;but I'll tell you
what I'll do. I'll make you manager right off and give you five
thousand a year and an engagement for five years certain. Then if I got
the insurance money and didn't want to pay you, you'd have a
prim&acirc;-facie case against me. The largeness of the salary would
testify against me&mdash;will that do?"</p>

<p>"How could I sue you without confessing."</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" exclaimed Mr. Boulger, exasperated by the
reasonableness of the objection and intensely desirous, as only a weak
nature is, to have the matter settled without further suspense.</p>

<p>"I can't see any way but a promissory note. It might be deposited
with some third person who would keep it until we both asked him to
return it."</p>

<p>"No. I can't do that. Why should you and I, Dave, give ourselves
into the power of any third party. I'll make you manager at once and
bind the agreement as I said, but the note's foolish. You can surely
trust me?"</p>

<p>Tryon knew Mr. Boulger well enough to know that when pressed too far
he was apt to become stupidly obstinate. After a short pause for
thought he began:</p>

<p>"The risk's great; the store mightn't be burned out; the fire
brigade's well organised; but what I undertake to do, shall be done as
well as I can do it.</p>

<p>Yet I must think of myself, too. Do you mind," and here he looked
Mr. Boulger in the face, "giving that note to Miss Georgie to keep? I
guess you can trust her." In spite of himself a light as of
comprehension and satisfaction came over the upper part of Mr.
Boulger's countenance. Quickly Tryon went on: "You might take me out
with you some evening. If she tells me she'll keep the paper for two
months and then give it to me or open it herself before us, and decide
between us, I shall be content."</p>

<p>"If you care for Georgie," broke in Mr.Boulger, joyously, "the
matter's settled. Georgie's good; she'll not go back on either of us,
and I had reckoned anyway on givin' her nearly as much when she
married."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Tryon, "I love her, or else I'd never think of doing
what you want."</p>

<p>"Pshaw, man!" Mr. Boulger said loudly, "the risk ain't worth
considerin'. Everything'll turn out right as I always felt it must.
Dave, I'm real glad. There's no one I'd rather have for a son-in-law
than you&mdash;no one. I'm glad I came in this evenin'. Now I can go
home and sleep with my mind at rest. But 'twas a near thing; that bill
of Stewart's'll fall due in six weeks, and my note at the bank, too. I
guess we'll be able to pay them, eh, Dave?"</p>

<p>The loud satisfaction, the inconsequent speech, grated upon Tryon's
nerves. Oppressed by doubts he could not still, he answered coldly:</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps you will."</p>

<p>The words and voice seemed to Mr. Boulger to indicate doubt if not
regret. Accordingly he hastened to clinch the bargain without delay,
and to give vent to his relief and joy in what seemed to him a generous
way. Putting his arm on the young man's shoulder, he exclaimed, with
kindly eagerness</p>

<p>"But I was forgettin'! The least I can do is to make my son-in-law
manager right off, eh, Dave? I can do that right now. An' it'll show
you that I'm willin' to keep my word."</p>

<p>Tryon protested sincerely, "'twas time enough for that; a day or two
wouldn't matter; 'twouldbe better to sleep on it,"&mdash;and so forth.
His inheritance of honest instincts had begun to stir in him again, and
made him hesitate to engage himself. But Mr. Boulger wouldn't be
denied. Tryon's protestations only excited him to immediate action; he
sat down at the desk and wrote the appointment. As he dried the ink the
thought came to him that he was giving something for nothing; but he
consoled himself by calling to mind the powers employers possessed to
rid themselves of cashiers, or even managers, who didn't please them.
Besides, Tryon was worth the money in any house of business, and as a
son-in-law he'd be more easily dealt with;&mdash;Mr. Boulger's fears
prevented him from thinking clearly. Folding the paper carefully he
handed it to Tryon.</p>

<p>"There, Dave," he said, trying to speak impressively, "that's a long
step towards fortune. I guess managers often turn into partners. An' I
don't wish for a better partner than you. I'll get that other thing
written right soon, and I'll speak to Mrs. Boulger tonight. Then you
can come out whenever you like." With the feeling that he had done his
best, and might lose all influence over his seemingly impassive
listener if he continued, he added shortly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, I guess, I'll have to be goin'. Good night, Dave," and left
the store. But before he had walked a hundred yards towards the
livery-stable where he had "put up" his horses and buggy, he had begun,
not only to regret his decision, but to resolve to modify it. His
thoughts ran thus:</p>

<p>"He's smart, I guess, very smart. I didn't intend to make him
manager or to offer more than a hundred thousand. I hadn't no need to;
he's in love with Georgie; he'd have done it for her, perhaps. Why, he
said so. He did! I don't mind the hundred thousand, though it's too
much&mdash;far too much. Any young man would have done it for fifty. I
was too hasty, though I was in a real tight place. And then, as manager
he'll want to do everythin'. I'll have to give way before&mdash;and
afterwards it'll be hard to alter. I was too hasty, I was, and too
generous. That's always been my fault&mdash;generosity. I like to do
things largely; I hate meanness. And then I give myself away every
time." But as this course of self-reproach recalled unpleasant
memories, Mr. Boulger broke it off:</p>

<p>"What's to be done now? Of course, I want to treat him
fairly,&mdash;I guess I'll draw that note and leave the sum blank. Then
I'll say, 'See here, Dave, you belong to us now, and I've two other
girls; I reckon I'll fill this in for a hundred thousand, eh?' He can't
object&mdash;put in that way. He won't: he wants Georgie. He'll have
seen her then and talked to her. I guess it'll be all right. He'll do
it: there's no fear about that. . . .</p>

<p>"Damn those insurance companies anyway. They've got premiums out of
me for thirty years. Now, it's my turn. I'm only getting back my own
money from them after all."</p>

<p>David Tryon wasn't able to console himself so easily, nor so
completely. Brought face to face with fraud and crime, his deeper
nature revolted.Yet his own dissatisfied conscience forced him to think
with bitterest contempt of Mr. Boulger.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't do the work nor let me do it either. The vain fool!
Always running about showing off, and leaving his business to take care
of itself, and this is what it has come to. I've to save him, and how!
In six months the business properly worked would bring him out all
right, but he goes and leaves everything to the last moment, and then,
puts it all on to me."</p>

<p>This train of thought, however, seemed to Tryon unprofitable; his
understanding of his own resolution forced him to renounce the pleasure
of condemning his master. "I guess he only acted according to his
nature&mdash;and now I've to go right on."</p>

<p>Characteristically he thought first of what he ought to do, the
steps which should be taken. Forethought would avert suspicion. In
outline at least the enterprise was soon clear to him. He trusted much
to time and careful deliberation; he intended to consider the whole
scheme again and again before proceeding to carry it into execution.
Meanwhile he wouldn't delay any needful preparation. Having decided so
much, he allowed his thoughts to wander. It was characteristic of his
nature that they turned first to his mother, and to the joy she would
feel in his success. Tryon was neither passionate nor very
affectionate, but his affections were of those which grow with custom
and association; and the isolation of the life he had led with his
widowed mother made him connect her with himself in an intimate
communityof feeling and interest. It irritated him, therefore, to
realise all at once that he could take no pleasure in his mother's
delight; he felt distinctly that she wouldn't be glad if she knew all,
and the sincerity in him prevented him from sharing even in
anticipation in her joy.</p>

<p>As he put the agreement in his pocket, turned out the lamp, and set
forth for home, it came to him suddenly that if his mother's suspicions
were aroused, if the rapidity of his rise led her to fear, however
vaguely, anything resembling the truth, she would certainly oppose his
design with all her strength. For the first time there was a gulf
between them. But instead of setting himself to think of the meaning
and cause of this separation he simply resolved to pretend to be frank
and deceive her. His mind was made up. It was better that she should
know nothing. Yet as he reached the house he felt intensely
uncomfortable. Deceit was painful to him. He resolved to say as little
as possible.</p>

<p>According to her invariable custom, his mother was waiting up for
him. When he spoke to her of getting a larger house and engaging a
"help," and showed her the agreement, attributing his advancement to
the way he had worked in getting out the balance-sheet, she seemed in
no way surprised, though the sudden delight brought quick tears to her
eyes. Her boy thought of her first of all. This was perhaps the heart
of her joy, and yet she gave no expression to it in words. Even when
most deeply moved, men and women speak generally from the ruffled
surface of their souls. Thetranquil depths of perfect honesty and
self-abnegation in this mother-heart could not come easily to
expression.</p>

<p>"It makes me very happy for you, Dave," she said, trying to smile,
"but you deserve it all; you've worked night and day; all last night
you were writing. Oh, I heard you. A mother doesn't sleep when her
son's waking. . . . I've got more happiness through you than I ever
expected in this world. It makes me feel as if all my prayers had been
answered. God's very good to me, Dave." And through her tears she
added, with a deprecating smile, "To think I used to be afraid you
weren't smart!"</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief Tryon felt that the chief ordeal was passed;
he felt, too, somewhat to his surprise, that he did enjoy his mother's
deep happiness, though he knew he had no right to enjoy it.</p>

<p>Success, he understood, might bring him more even than assured
position and wealth; it might bring content. After a talk, which was
cut short by his mother insisting that he must go to bed and get a good
rest, Tryon went to his room to think of Georgie. He felt certain that
under the present circumstances she wouldn't refuse him. And in his
self-controlled nature, desires awoke alien to his habit and coloured
the picture his fancy painted of a future passed between his mother and
his wife.</p>

<p>Long after her son had gone to sleep the mother sat nursing her
delight, following it into all its possibilities. What wouldn't her
Dave do and become? A member of Congress, perhaps, loved andhonoured by
all, as he deserved. Woman-like she had made an idol of him ever since
his school-boy triumphs; and to her larger, more expansive, and more
generous nature his cool self-restraint and steady purpose seemed the
ideal of noble manhood. And mingled with her admiration of his strength
and resolution, was an intense tingling gratitude for his affection. He
had thought first of her and her wellbeing. At the remembrance of his
words quick, sweet tears of pleasure came again to her eyes. A sense of
life's compensations penetrated her as she thought of her husband and
son together. Yet she was superstitiously afraid to admit even to
herself what she felt to be the fact, that she was blessed in her son
beyond her own deserts, beyond all previous suffering. Great joy, she
felt, must be followed by lasting sorrow. She set herself, therefore,
to wonder when he would marry, and whom he would choose. No one in
Kansas City was at all worthy of him; she'd advise him to wait;
meanwhile she'd look out for him, for she knew exactly the sort of
woman who would make him happy. And yet not even the ideal in her mind
was worthy of her son&mdash;of Dave!</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_6">II</a></h3>

<p>About a week after Mr. Boulger's nocturnal visit to his house of
business, his wife and his three unmarried daughters were assembled in
the drawing-room of their country residence, awaiting his arrival, and
that of the manager, Mr. Tryon,whom, to their surprise, Mr. Boulger
seemed resolved to honour. A word or two about Mrs. Boulger and her
daughters may not be out of place here.</p>

<p>In person Mrs. Boulger was thin and dry, but in spite of sallow
complexion and round black eyes the sharp-featured face and tall figure
had a certain dignity. She belonged, as she was pleased to inform
everyone, to an old Southern family&mdash;a family, she used to add,
that had been slave-holders "for generations." In truth, the little
plantation of the Carters had been bought by the grandfather, but as
she advanced in life, and her position improved, Mrs. Boulger's
ancestors grew in number and legendary importance. Pride was her
dominant quality and, in process of time, it had swollen to such
exaggeration that it bred virtues in her, foreign to her nature. Just
as it would have been difficult to induce her to do anything which
seemed to her unworthy of a great position, so nothing would prevent
her doing what she thought her position demanded. She lived, therefore,
at the rate which her ever-increasing knowledge of luxuries required,
careless of the fact that in the last years she had spent more than her
husband could earn.</p>

<p>The eldest daughter, Ada, resembled her mother save that she was
good-looking, well-educated and accepted in faith her mother's
imaginary descent and hereditary splendour. She was selfish, as her
mother was, unconsciously and intensely, with a complacent
self-approval that her mother could hardly reach. The unity of type of
Mrs. Boulgerand Ada had had certain curious effects upon the two
younger girls.</p>

<p>Ivy, the youngest, seemed in many ways to take after her father. In
person she was an inferior copy&mdash;small and slight of figure, with
a doll's face. The self-satisfied pride of her mother and eldest sister
had intensified and developed her egotism to deliberate and conscious
purpose. Her emulative instincts and her desire to please had led her
to cultivate her manners, which would have been perfect had she been
able to comprehend any nature other than her own. Her ruthless
self-seeking and obstinacy had won the unwilling respect even of her
mother, and she was undoubtedly her father's favourite.</p>

<p>Georgie, on the other hand, was by nature honest, frank and kindly.
She tried to dwell on the good qualities of her mother and sisters, but
unknown to herself their egotism brought out and developed the
unselfishness in her. She found it easy to yield to the demands they
were continually making on her good-nature; though sometimes she
rendered service with a certain contempt. For Georgie was not a saint
to whom self-sacrifice was a pleasure, but a sound-hearted girl with a
strong craving for affection. To her alone the return to Kansas City
was a source of satisfaction. She looked forward hopefully and with a
confused yet eager anticipation of life's joy and purpose to the
meeting with Tryon, whom she had liked and trusted from the first. She
thought of herself and even of her person with reasonable pleasure. She
knew perfectly well that she was not so tallor elegant as Ada, but she
was stronger and had better health. Again and again, too, she had
noticed that if men were first attracted by Ada's good looks and
stateliness or by Ivy's charming manners and affectation of intense
interest, the majority of them came gradually to pay her attentions
which, if not passionate, were, at least, constant and sincere. She
had, accordingly, a premonition that life would afford her what she
most desired, and therewith she was content. If her outlook was narrow
it was clear. She was truthful and trustworthy, as are the
unimaginative. Neither her father nor Tryon had reason to fear betrayal
from her; she held to the plain rules of conduct and liked the straight
lines cut by American roads and streets. As soon as her father had
spoken of Tryon, even before he mentioned his promotion to the post of
manager she had divined that her future was intimately concerned. And
this gratified not only the better part of her nature but also a
certain vanity. She had always wished to be married before either of
her sisters; she felt that she had more affection to give than they
possessed, and Ivy's vanity and selfishness and Ada's complacent pride
seemed to her to render them distinctly her inferiors.</p>

<p>In spite of the unusual enthusiasm with which Mr. Boulger spoke of
Tryon, neither Mrs. Boulger nor Ada was at all inclined to attribute
much importance to his visit. They knew themselves to be far above
clerkdom. But Ivy noticed at once that her father seemed to speak at
Georgie in particular, and it was easy for her to interpret
herfavourite sister's manner. When she entered the drawing-room she saw
that Georgie, like herself, had dressed with more than ordinary care. A
certain feminine jealousy in her came at once to speech, though she
tried to modify the bitterness of her words because it was no part of
her policy to offend the sister who was continually doing her
kindnesses, and whom she liked as much as she could like any one.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," she said carelessly, "it's no use for you and me to
get ourselves up for Mr. Tryon while Ada's there. We haven't a chance
with her. After all, I don't mind. I don't want papa's manager. But
it's a pity you're not looking your best to-day&mdash;you've too much
colour."</p>

<p>Georgie felt the keenness of the shaft which, indeed deepened the
healthy flush of her cheeks, but she maintained her self-control, and
after a short pause, spoke of indifferent things. A few minutes later,
just after the lights had been brought in, and the windows closed, Mr.
Boulger and Tryon entered the room. Mrs. Boulger was polite, and even
pleasant to Tryon, as she always was to new acquaintances, and Ada
attempted to appropriate him as if each and every man must needs wish
to be at her feet. Tryon, though not at ease, showed to advantage. His
purpose was so strong that nothing of the self-conscious awkwardness of
his youth was visible, and when, after replying politely to the elder
sister, he turned to Georgie, she was astonished by the improvement in
him. He was more manly, masterful even, she thought, with a flush
ofpleasure, which gave her a charming expression of girlish
embarrassment. Besides, she really felt somewhat shy. The fidelity in
Tryon's look brought the future very close to her, and she was
astonished at the strength of the feelings he called forth in her.</p>

<p>The evening passed pleasantly enough. Ada, it is true, was at times
contemptuous; Ivy made remarks which were significant and slightly
malicious, but Mr. Boulger' s unceasing good-humour, and Mrs. Boulger's
pleasure in recounting her European experiences made things go
smoothly. From her conversation, Tryon gathered that Mrs. Boulger
looked upon America since the abolition of slavery as a very poor
place; "The servants were ill-taught and independent," was a phrase,
the sense of which he could not seize. The dinner seemed to him
oppressive in length; he felt that it wasn't right for people to drink
wine with their meals, and that the house was too splendid to be
comfortable. He told his mother afterwards that it was like being
dressed always in one's best clothes. But Georgie's eyes and words
showed him that she, at any rate, understood and appreciated him, and
that was enough. After dinner, too, she arranged matters so that Tryon
could talk to her <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, and when he
hoped that she had kept her promise not to forget old friends, she
replied without affectation that she had not forgotten him. Her
frankness put him at his ease, and to his own surprise he found himself
speaking to her with interest of the business and the improvements he
hoped to effect in it. The insightand energy in him impressed her, but
more still the strength and persistence which she felt to be the
foundation of his character. Once, at least, she caught herself
blushing, half with surprise at an incautious phrase which betrayed the
strength of her feeling for him. As he grew in her esteem she showed a
good humour and enjoyment which made her quite pretty. In fine, they
both appeared at their best; they were both conscious of this, and each
accordingly felt increased sympathy for the other. Towards eleven
o'clock Mr. Boulger approached them.</p>

<p>"Georgie," he said, in a low voice, after a few careless sentences,
"we both want you to come down early to-morrow morning; we've something
to talk over with you, and as Dave wants to go to business before eight
o'clock, you should be down at seven to give him and me breakfast."</p>

<p>Mr. Boulger's tone and confidential manner were highly significant.
Most girls would have felt somewhat embarrassed at the quick approach
of the decisive moment, but Georgie answered quite naturally:</p>

<p>"All right, father, I'll be here at half-past six. Now it's time to
go to bed, I suppose, though, thanks to Mr. Tryon, the evening has
seemed very short."</p>

<p>For some time after he reached his room, Tryon gave himself up to
thought. He felt certain that Georgie cared for him, and that she would
consent to be his wife. Her frankness and good humour had been very
pleasant to him, almost as delightful in fact as certain signs of
affection which herecalled with joy. On all points save one his mind
was at rest. Her frank affection had increased his confidence in her to
such an extent that he felt inclined to confide in her without reserve.
She deserved complete trust, he knew, and he felt that she ought to
know beforehand what he intended to do. The influence of his business
training had been so immoral that he would have decided probably to
tell her his secret had not his high opinion of his mother restrained
him. Perhaps Georgie would take the same view of it as his mother
would. Perhaps? Certainly. Then there was nothing more to think of; he
would say nothing, and go ahead.</p>

<p align="center" class="cen">* * * * *</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The next morning Tryon was in the breakfast-room at six o'clock. The
servants were leaving the room as he entered it. He had not waited long
when Georgie came in. She looked so bright and neat; her blue eyes so
glad and her complexion so fresh that he felt his senses stir again in
him as they had stirred more than once during the previous evening.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Tryon. You are down early. Has father appeared
yet?"</p>

<p>"No, and I'm glad he hasn't," replied Tryon steadily, "for I've
something to ask you first," he added, as their hands met. "Do you
remember," he went on, "how kind you were to me when I was with you at
school?"</p>

<p>Georgie tried to meet his eyes but could not. It was too sudden.
Still she would have controlled even this faint testimony to her joy
andsatisfaction had not a delicious feeling of pride in his directness
and a certain shy longing to yield herself completely to his
masterfulness made it impossible for her to do anything save try by
<em>thinking of something else</em> to still the tumultuous beating of
her heart while following his every word.</p>

<p>"Well, ever since that day you asked me about the sum, I've loved
you, and now, Georgie, I want to know whether you care enough for me to
be my wife? "</p>

<p>At the direct question, none of the romantic imaginings of her
girlhood came into her head; on the contrary, her previous emotions
even seemed to leave her. She regained self-possession at once and,
looking him in the face, she answered,</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>As he put his arms round her and kissed her again and again, the
tumultuous emotions came back to her with an added keenness of pleasure
in being so embraced, which made it impossible for her at first to add
anything to the simplicity of her avowal. But in a moment or two she
disengaged herself. She felt afraid of herself&mdash;afraid lest these
new, strong, delightful emotions might carry her further than she ought
to go. She felt shy, too, and strove to hide her shyness under an
affected confidence.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, with an added flush on her cheeks and brightness in
her glance, "after having crumpled my frock and loosened my hair, and
made me hot, perhaps you'll tell me was this the reason why papa wanted
me to come down. early?"</p>

<p>"One of the reasons, I think," said Tryon, smiling in response to
her smile. "Didn't you guess it, Georgie?" and he put his hand on her
shoulder as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Perhaps; but do you know you've altered a great deal; you're not
like what you were-I mean you're-older, and I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you did think of me sometimes, Georgie?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded her head with deep tenderness in her eyes. A need of
frank confession was upon her, for her whole nature opened to this
affection freely, as a flower to the sun's warmth.</p>

<p>"I just hated Europe and wanted that tour to end, for I was lonely
often, and I thought perhaps you cared for me, though I wasn't sure you
did so much&mdash;till last night. It is good to like some one, isn't
it, and to be&mdash;liked? "</p>

<p>After this she did not seek to free herself, but suffered him to
kiss her and to lead her to the sofa. The talk between them, made up of
memories, and the questions and answers of a happy affection, seemed to
have lasted but a minute when Mr. Boulger came into the room.</p>

<p>"That's right," he exclaimed joyfully, rubbing his hands, as the two
stood up quickly as he came towards them, "that's right. I guess you've
settled the main point already." But the part of happy father,
difficult for Mr. Boulger to play at any time, was impossible without
the help of even a word from either of the young people, and so, after
a pause, he added more seriously and in almost his ordinary tone: "Now,
Georgie,you must let me take Dave away for a minute, as we've somethin'
to mettle first. We'll be back soon."</p>

<p>Without more ado he led Tryon into the drawing-room, and, taking a
long white envelope from his breast-pocket as he went, he said
hastily:</p>

<p>"Here's the note, Dave. You see I've filled in the sum as a hundred
thousand. I've other girls, and&mdash;an' that was my first
proposition. Wasn't it? You won't mind, I guess; you'll have ten or
fifteen thousand dollars a year to live on, an' Georgie's a good girl
an' not extravagant, an' you'll be better off anyway than any young
pair in the town, an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tryon's real rapidity of judgment stood him in good stead on this
occasion. He felt it was impossible for him to bargain at such a time,
although the trick was palpable and irritated him. He saw at a glance,
however, that nothing remained for him but to accept the situation. It
was evidence of his rare adaptability that he also resolved to humour
the cheat. Georgie's father was worth conciliating.</p>

<p>"All right," he replied slowly but with a smile. "I guess it's hard
to trade with you and come out even. You're smart. There's no doubt
about that."</p>

<p>The smile of self-satisfaction which spread over Mr. Boulger's face
at what he accepted as a pleasant truth showed Tryon that he had said
enough, so he broke off, and after looking over the paper carefully, he
folded it up, and placing it again in the envelope, returned it.</p>

<p>"That makes you somethin' like my partner, you know, Dave," said Mr.
Boulger conciliatingly, "and I mean to act fair by you always. I've
every reason to now&mdash;but I'll be glad when it's all over. When do
you think&mdash;but I guess we'll have time to talk of that after
breakfast. Now, come."</p>

<p>On their return to the breakfast-room Mr. Boulger handed the
envelope to Georgie.</p>

<p>"You're to keep that, Georgie, for three months." (The girl
flushed.) "Then you're to give it to Dave, or, if I object, you're to
open it and decide fairly between us. D'you understand? I guess we can
both count on you&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl, knitting her brows and looking from her lover
to her father. "At the end of three months I'm to give it to Mr. Tryon,
unless you object, but if you do, I'm to open it and decide. It seems
strange. Mayn't I know what's in this mysterious envelope?"</p>

<p>"Girls mustn't know too much at once," replied Mr. Boulger
carelessly; "but now keep the paper safe, and let's have breakfast. I'm
real hungry. An' I guess Dave'll be able to eat a square meal, too.
Happiness is a good sauce&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>The breakfast was cheerful and pleasant. Mr. Boulger talked
incessantly in a somewhat excited way, which left the young people to
their thoughts and interchange of looks. Dave Tryon was more than
satisfied with his success. Georgie seemed to him an ideal wife; and
the girl herself would have been lost in her deep content had she not
noticed anxiously that her lover now and then seemed very
thoughtful.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_7">III</a></h3>

<p>The store was composed of four storeys, three of which were filled
with goods. The staircase ran from close to Tryon's office, in the back
part of the first floor, towards the front, and emerged on the fourth
floor, dividing it into two almost equal halves. Here in a sort of
attic lived a German with his wife, who, by way of rent, took care of
the building, sweeping and dusting it out in the mornings and at night,
airing it in summer, lighting the fires in winter, and so on. As soon
as Tryon thought of getting in wood he remembered the Lenzes. He had
always given Lenz the money for the wood and current expenses, and he
had now to see him in order, if possible, to get Lenz to propose to buy
a quantity of wood at once for cheapness' sake and to store it beneath
the stairway. This was easily accomplished; a few words of praise
induced the simple German to take upon himself the honour&mdash;and the
responsibility&mdash;of having suggested this important purchase. So
far so good. But Tryon understood that if he tried to get the Lenzes to
leave the store on any pretence whatever, suspicion would at once
attach to him. They must go out of their own accord, and he would have
to take advantage of the opportunity which chance or their habits might
offer. The worst of it was that he knew next to nothing of the Lenzes
or of their way of living. They did their work so well that he had had
but few occasions to speak to them, and the contempt whichAmericans
feel for all foreigners, and particularly for those who speak with a
foreign accent, had hindered him from having any intercourse with them.
Tryon realised that it would never do to question Lenz as to his habits
and customs. These he must learn from others. So he began to frequent a
German lager-bier saloon in the evenings and talk with the customers.
This served another purpose. Tryon's rooted repugnance to fraud was
stirred to activity chiefly by his mother; intercourse with her
awakened all that was honest in him, and again and again led him to
question his resolve. And this was very painful to him: hesitation
being intolerable to men accustomed to action. Accordingly he soon
became aware that his visits to the lager-bier saloon not only
increased his knowledge of Germans and their ways, but also diminished
the unconscious influence of his mother upon him, and so freed him from
remorseful doubtings, which were hard to combat. He, therefore, kept up
his visits to the saloon long after his primary object was
accomplished, and he excused himself to his mother for the lateness of
his homecomings by alleging the necessity for increased exertions in
his new position. Mrs. Tryon accepted this excuse the more readily as
her son had, of course, informed her that he was engaged to Georgie
Boulger. In spite of Mrs. Tryon's natural jealousy, the girl's
frankness had made a favourable impression upon her, and the two soon
became as good friends as such a connection permits even between women
who are both of kindly nature.</p>

<p>In his third or fourth visit to the saloon Tryon found out that the
<i>Turn-Verein Fest</i>, a sort of annual festival, which all Germans
of the middle and lower classes are accustomed to attend, would be held
on the 1st of August (his visit to the Boulger's took place on the 10th
July). A few evenings later he learned that Lenz and his wife were
almost sure to be present, and as Lenz held some sort of subordinate
office in the <i>Verein</i>, he would be kept at the festival till
midnight or later. Tryon had, therefore, nothing to do but prepare
everything, wait for the evening of the 1st, and then act.
Methodically, according to his habit, he took the evenings in the
saloon for thought, and during the day set himself to organise and
develop the business with all his energy. That he knew would avert
suspicion from him. Who could imagine that the energetic manager would
set the building on fire wherein he worked with tireless devotion? And
in the evenings spent in the saloon, while considering and
reconsidering all the details of his plan, he was but little troubled
by remorse or doubts. The unfamiliar faces in the saloon, and the
strange speech, moved him to dislike and contempt excited, indeed, his
combative instincts while subduing his better nature. So the days
passed, marked by no incident save an occasional sentence or two
exchanged with Georgie when, from time to time, she, with her mother or
sisters, visited the store. Mr. Boulger seldom went to business after
Tryon's inauguration as manager; and, when he did go, the mere sight of
Tryon's activity and resolution seemed to assure him thathis cause was
in good hands. It was characteristic of Tryon, and of his opinion of
Mr. Boulger that he never told his employer when or how he intended to
effect their purpose. Somehow or other Tryon felt sure that if Mr.
Boulger knew the moment, he would "fuss" and perhaps excite suspicion;
besides, as he had undertaken to do the thing, he wished to do it in
his own way, taking all the responsibility upon his own shoulders. He
felt stronger alone than with any associate.</p>

<p>At length the 1st of August dawned. A cloudless, hot day even when
Tryon awoke at half-past five. There was wind, too, a moderate breeze
from the north-east, of all winds the most favourable to his design. He
couldn't help smiling as the proverb came into his head, "It's an ill
wind &mdash;&mdash;." He felt proud of himself; as the trial came near
he was neither elated nor depressed. As usual he talked quietly with
his mother over his breakfast and then walked to the store. All the day
through he worked as usual, perhaps with a slight increase of energy,
but with all his wits about him. Towards six o'clock he happened to be
standing just outside his office when the Lenzes, dressed in their best
clothes, came down the stairs towards him. The shop was filled with
customers availing themselves of the comparative coolness of the
evening to make their purchases. No one of the clerks had time to
notice the outgoing couple or the short conversation which took place
between Lenz and Tryon.</p>

<p>"Going out, Mr,</p>

<p>asked Tryon carelessly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but we come back before twelve hour and den I set
everytink in order."</p>

<p>The man appeared to have more to say; but Tryon turned away smiling,
and Mrs. Lenz drew her spouse towards the back door. With their
departure Tryon felt that his last anxiety was lifted. An hour or so
later he sat in his office alone. In half an hour more he had posted
his books in his usual, firm, clear hand. It was still quite light. He
went up the staircase looking round each room as he went. When he
reached the third floor he walked to one of the front windows and threw
it up. By an instinct of carefulness when he returned to the staircase
he went up the narrow stairs which were unprotected by a hand-rail, to
the fourth floor and looked round the bare attic. On his right stood a
wooden partition which cut off the Lenzes' abode from the rest of the
huge space; he saw their door; it was closed. Of course, he thought,
they've locked it till their return. He went down the stairs again and
stopped before the petroleum cask which stood in the corner formed by
his office; it was covered from view by a piece of cloth (damaged
goods), which lay on it half unrolled. In the short interval which had
elapsed since he had ascended the stairs, it had grown dark. By moving
a step or two, however, he could still see to the top of the flight,
but while he looked the shadows came and shrouded everything in night
and mystery. He needed no light. He knew it was about nine o'clock and
that was the hour he had fixed upon as most favourable to his
purpose&mdash;a little earlier and business peoplewere still about, a
little later and the frequenters of saloons and bars would be on their
homeward way. His fire had a clear hour or so in which to do its work;
less than half that time he had decided would be more than sufficient.
Quietly he moved to the back-door, drew aside the green curtain and
peered out over the empty lot. Nothing stirred. He could just see dimly
across the lane to the backs of the houses which fronted north on
Jackson Street; their outlines cast shadows against the sky. Nothing
stirred. He dropped the curtain and returned to the cask of petroleum;
he didn't even lift up the cloth which covered it; he put his hand down
underneath it and&mdash;turned the tap. He had studied the floor
carefully weeks ago; he knew that the number of people passing up and
down the staircase must have depressed the floor there. He heard
nothing but the glug, glug, glug, of the running oil, which seemed to
keep time to the strong thumping of his heart. A few moments and the
glug, glug grew slower and then silence reigned again. He had drawn a
step or two backwards just to make sure that none of the oil spreading
should come on his boots.</p>

<p>Now he struck a wax-match, and looked. Everything had taken place
just as he had planned it. The petroleum had run from the corner, and
now lay in a broad pool at the foot of the stairs, spreading two, oily,
dark arms around it as if to embrace its prey. Just on the edge of the
pool stood his basket of waste-paper, and reaching from the basket to
the dry floor a long horn of paper. For a moment Tryon paused, but
onlyfor a moment; then he stepped forward and put the match to the end
of the paper-horn. As the paper caught fire he turned and walked
quickly to the back-door. He opened it and looked out for a minute or
so while he unlocked the outside iron grating: nothing stirred. He
entered the store again, and, holding the door nearly shut in his hand,
he put his foot against the large pane of glass and pressed steadily.
Suddenly it broke under the pressure and fell jingling. Nothing
stirred, and yet he uttered an exclamation to deceive a possible
listener. People later, would think the glass was broken by the heat.
It was worth risking to create a thorough draught. One glance backward
showed him the thick horn of paper blazing. Quickly he stepped outside
and shut the door. As he put the key in the lock he heard above its
grating a sort of hissing noise. He peered about him. Nothing stirred;
silence and darkness enfolded him. Standing in front of the broken
window, he put his hand carefully through and drew a small piece of the
curtain aside, then, stooping, he looked in. At once he let the curtain
go, and, turning, passed through the iron grating, which he locked. As
he went to the lane and walked down it he felt a glow of heat on his
back&mdash;fancy, of course; but it wasn't fancy the great flame which
had shocked his eyes a moment ago, and which still seemed to blind him.
It wasn't fancy either that crackling noise of dry wood blazing. But he
hadn't gone fifty yards down the lane before the breathless excitement
left him, giving place to a feeling of satisfaction. He had donehis
work well, as he always did, and if nothing stirred and no one had seen
him, that was only what experience had taught him to expect. As he
walked rapidly towards the German saloon his satisfaction grew almost
to exultation. He had foreseen everything; planned everything rightly,
even to the draught, and now the wood under the staircase was blazing,
and the staircase itself a tunnel of flame. Half an hour and Boulger's
store would be afire so that no engines could extinguish the flames
till the floors fell in, leaving the blackened walls to be gazed at by
a crowd, as when Treadwell's burned down in the winter. And no one had
seen him; he knew beforehand that it was a hundred chances to one that
no one would, and with the long odds went success&mdash;Georgie and
money, and a full, strong life of successful labour. That was the
difference between men like himself and criminals. Those who committed
crimes, as a rule, were degraded and debased specimens of humanity, who
had neither foresight nor coolness. He had both, therefore everything
went well with him. With these thoughts and in the mood they indicate,
he reached the saloon. It was nearly empty; he took his usual seat and
called for a glass of lager-bier. Instinctively when in the light he
looked at his right foot&mdash;no, neither the oil nor the glass had
marked it; he was too cool, had taken too much care to make any
slightest mistake. As the <i>Kellner</i> brought him his beer Tryon
watched to see if the man noticed anything unusual in his appearance or
manner. No; with a "Goot evenin'!" the man put the glass before him,and
turned away indifferently. Reassured, Tryon set himself to consider
once again, as he had often considered in the last few days, the
question whether any one could connect him with the fire? No&mdash;no
one. Suspicion there might be. It was to Boulger's interest that the
store should be burned; the insurance was very heavy, and therefore he,
or some one moved by him, might have done the work, but then Boulger's
name was good, and of proof or of connecting link there wasn't a
trace.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of Tryon that his feeling of complete security
should awaken remorse in him.</p>

<p>"'Twas a miserable thing to have done after all&mdash;a mean fraud.
Theft," he faced the word, "theft. What a fool Boulger had been; what a
vain, weak &mdash;&mdash; Now, there was nothing for it but to get to
work. If Boulger played fair and made him a partner, he might yet get
rich enough to make up for the fraud. He didn't want to steal; there
was no dishonest instinct in him, he felt proudly. He knew what he
could make of the business; with half the stock it should bring in at
least a hundred thousand dollars profit the first year, and more in
every succeeding year. Then if he got rich he'd pay the money back in
some way&mdash;pay it to the poor; they needed it more than the rich
insurance companies. But he'd see that they got something, too. The new
store would, of course, be fireproof; he'd insure it for more than the
proper amount, for more than it was insured at before, and he'd not
carry half thestock. So the insurance companies would get some of their
money back, anyway. There'd be no more fires while Dave Tryon was
manager; he'd take care of that."</p>

<p>Here his reflections broke off in a chill of anxiety.</p>

<p>"If the fire hadn't caught, had burned out in spite of all his care.
Absurd. It had caught&mdash;it must have. He had done his work too well
to be afraid of that. But if it had caught, some one should have seen
it ere this. No. 'Twas better that no one should notice it for at least
half an hour, and he hadn't been sitting down ten minutes yet.</p>

<p>"Suppose some one noticed it now&mdash;now! and gave the alarm. It
might be put out, and all his work lost and hopes gone." Mechanically
he took out his handkerchief and wiped the cold perspiration from his
forehead. For the first time in his life he took up the glass and drank
the beer. Usually he spilled some of it and left the rest. In a moment
again his throat was parched; but he wouldn't drink any more; the
<i>Kellner</i> might remark it, if he asked for a second glass.</p>

<p>Every moment that passed made his position better. "'Twould be all
right." And so he sat and waited, outwardly calm; but every minute
seemed an hour to him, till he ventured to look at his watch, and saw
that it was half-past nine. Then relief came for a time.</p>

<p>"'Twas all right now; the traces of his work had all been destroyed
by this time, swallowed up by the flames. Poor work it was&mdash;mighty
poor."For ten minutes or a quarter of an hour this thought was with him
in all its bitterness; then the old doubts came to him again.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it hadn't caught, after all!&mdash;hadn't got to the
piled-up wood. Some one would surely have noticed it by now if it had
really caught, as he intended it should. But, no! That hour was the
quietest in the whole day. Besides the front door was so protected;
till the second storey was blazing no one could see anything. But as
the minutes passed the doubt grew stronger and stronger. In spite of
his resolution and courage his feverish anxiety made it almost
impossible for him to sit quietly there and wait while the precious
minutes flew. Weeks ago, he had made up his mind to go back to the
store at half-past ten, if the alarm had not been given before, and in
case the fire had burnt out, to do his best to hide his handiwork. And
it was already quarter past ten; his face seemed to grow harder and
thinner as he thought that, after all, it was possible that his labour
and care had been vain.</p>

<p>Of a sudden his eager senses became aware of a stir in the distance;
he listened, and could hear nothing. Yet again, and far away the air
seemed to be stirred with sound, though he could distinguish nothing.
He looked about him; no one seemed to have noticed anything unusual.
Yet he was sure, and his heart and temples throbbed tumultuously.
There! Distinctly he heard running footsteps pass the corner hastening
up Lee Street. Would those dolts never hear, and so give him the chance
of flying to the scene of action? There!and again the hurrying
footsteps and the vibrant, living air with its eager message seemed to
draw nearer and nearer, and past the door of the saloon went one
racing. At last the Germans seemed to become conscious that something
unusual was afoot.</p>

<p>As the <i>Kellner</i> stopped on his way to an open-mouthed customer
and looked towards the door, which hurrying footsteps were again
passing, Tryon rose quietly and walked to the bar. As he laid down his
quarter he said to the proprietor:</p>

<p>"I guess there's something the matter."</p>

<p>He was proud of the fact that his voice was as quiet and even as
usual, though the beatings of his heart seemed to shake his chest. As
the man turned towards him, the brazen voice of the alarm-bell shocked
the air. With the first note Tryon was in the street; he had felt that
all had risen to the warning, and that he was free to act. What a
relief it was to run lightly along the bending wooden sidewalk to the
corner. No more restraint needed; he could have shouted with the mere
delight of freedom and excitement. As he turned into Lee Street he
found himself beside another man who was racing, his breath coming in
short, laboured gasps.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" cried Tryon to him.</p>

<p>"Don't know."</p>

<p>Then others were beside him, and soon among the knot running some
one said:</p>

<p>"It's Boulger's."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Tryon, as if horrified, and at once sped away from
them.</p>

<p>As he stopped in front of the building he found himself in a group
of some thirty or forty men and boys, who were all gazing up at the
ominous red gleam in the window of the second storey. Thick smoke was
issuing from the window on the third floor, and in spite of the
darkness of the night could be seen against the sky, whirling away in
black wisps of rack. At the same moment Tryon became aware of a noise
within the building which was at once crackle and hiss and muffled
roar, the sound which once heard is never afterwards mistaken for any
other&mdash;the voice of a great fire with its chords of menace and
rage and triumph.</p>

<p>"What's to be done?" he cried, pushing his way towards the great
entrance. "I've the keys."</p>

<p>"Nothin', I guess," some one answered, "here's the engine."</p>

<p>Down the street it came, like a thing alive, the horses galloping,
the men shouting, and drew up before the door. As the firemen, with an
astonishing celerity, got to work, each man in his place, opening the
main, attaching the hose-pipe, etc., with the practical genius
characteristic of the race, and which is always seen at its best when
the need of action is greatest, Tryon stepped to the side of the
chief&mdash;"I've the keys. Shall I open the door?"</p>

<p>"No, 'twould make a draught," came the quick answer; "we'll have to
get to work through the second storey, though I'm afraid we're too
late."</p>

<p>The man had hardly finished speaking when there came a loud crash
and the noise of breakingglass, and then the flames, leaping from their
confinement out into the air through the second storey casements, lit
up great clouds of dust which rose from the quivering building, and the
faces of the firemen and those of the crowd of people who filled the
further side-walk, revealing every incident of the scene in one glare
of yellow-red light. Then the flames drew in again as a man draws
breath for a further effort.</p>

<p>"By God! The first floor's gone; the place'll fall in before we get
three engines to work. Clear the side-walks there! Fifty yards from the
engine. Stand back!"</p>

<p>As the order was given the crowd fell back quietly, drawing Tryon
with them. In a whirl of emotions and sensations not to be analyzed
then or afterwards, Tryon stood among his fellows while a ladder was
reared against the building, and a fireman climbed it and began to play
through the shattered windows of the second storey. He saw the flames
leap out against the stream of water as if in combat; he heard men
about him saying that in an hour the building would fall in; he was
conscious that a second engine had come to aid the first, and a little
later that a third had arrived, but thought was whelmed in feeling. He
realised that all efforts were in vain, that nothing could check the
fire, that his work was done&mdash;completely. And then remorse came
upon him; at first with a vague sense of loss, such as one feels in
missing the familiar and accustomed; later, with the full understanding
of waste and destruction, as acutely keen regret. Suddenly the
feelingebbed, leaving him conscious of utter weariness; instinctively
he changed his posture and began to look about him. He was on the edge
of the side-walk, about twenty yards below the circle wherein stood the
three engines, with the firemen moving about automatically in the
strong light which poured from the windows of the second storey. Far
away up and down the street the crowd stretched into the darkness. With
clear brain now he took in all the details of the scene. Two streams of
water rose from the street like silver serpents, bent in an arc which
ended hissing among the flames from the casements: the third, directed
by a fireman standing on a ladder at the height of the second storey,
but a little way from the window, ran out from the pipe in a long arrow
which, now here, now there, gleamed like a ray of moonlight. Tryon's
heart lay heavy within him as he took in the progress of the ruin he
had wrought. "Never again," he muttered to himself, "never again."</p>

<p>All at once came the sharp noise of glass breaking on the side-walk,
and then from the height above the fireman on the ladder, from a window
of the fourth storey a cry&mdash;a shrill child's voice shrieking in
terror&mdash;and as Tryon looked up he saw two thin arms waving and a
little black head which suddenly disappeared. Speechless, with a dread
he would not acknowledge and was afraid to understand, he stood at
gaze.</p>

<p>"Whose is the child?"</p>

<p>They were asking him! How should he know? He could do nothing but
look his horror. "Alittle nigger. A coloured girl. 'Bout twelve years
old;" the hurried exclamations fluttered; then all eyes turned again to
the burning building. Mechanically Tryon's followed. Three serpents
instead of two now curved from the street to the windows. Four of five
men were moving the ladder a little more to the left, and then came a
groan of disappointment as it was seen that the ladder only just
reached to the window of the third floor. Quickly a fireman ran up it
and disappeared through the window; the crowd surged forward, carrying
Tryon with it. The movement seemed to give him conscious thought.</p>

<p>"Not fire then&mdash;not theft. Murder!" The child must have been
employed by the Lenzes. The man's hesitation came back to him. He
understood it all at once. His previous remorse intensified to horror.
And in his horror came strangely the thought of his mother, nerving him
to action. "No, that mustn't be, sha'n't be," he said to himself; "not
that! not that!"</p>

<p>With the resolution the blood came back into his veins in quick
thrills. Just at this moment he saw the fireman appear again at the
window on the third storey, with a gesture as of regret. As the man
climbed over the sill and began to descend the ladder, Tryon with all
his senses about him, tore himself through the crowd as a bramble is
torn from a garment. As the firemen pushed him back from the foot of
the ladder, he said simply, "I know the way." They pointed to the man
descending and he waited a moment quietly. He was not one of those who
act bravely on animpulse; he needed thought and time for decision, but
once his resolution taken he was sure to carry it out undeterred by
fear of danger. As the fireman put his foot on the ground, Tryon began
to mount the ladder&mdash;slowly, for the work was new to
him&mdash;carefully, for he didn't mean to fall. As he went up, rung by
rung, more and more surely and quickly, stern joy came to him.</p>

<p>"This was the way. So he'd blot out his fault."</p>

<p>Such was his thought till he found himself on the third floor moving
towards the ladder staircase. He had gone perhaps half the way when he
felt himself choking with the smoke; his eyes, too, were burning; he
closed them and held his breath and went on quickly. A dozen steps and
he opened his eyes again. Before him to his left was the staircase, a
round furnace mouth of flame eating away at the ladder which led to the
fourth floor; it scorched his face; unconsciously he drew breath and
was nearly choked with the thick smoke. One quick glance and he turned
and ran back to the window.</p>

<p>The fireman had followed him up. Tryon thrust his head past him into
the air and drew two or three long, cool breaths. The fireman said,
"It's no use. No one can do it." Tryon filled his lungs to the
uttermost and turning with eyes shut ran down the store. He had judged
the distance in his mind. Of a sudden he stopped and opening his eyes
found himself almost where he had been before. Measuring the space with
his eye he took two quick steps&mdash;and jumped. He landed on the
ladder and scrambled up it. As he cameto the top he fell forward on his
face on the fourth floor. He could still breathe there. Instinctively
he rubbed his legs together to put out the fire which had caught his
trousers and was burning him. Then he called out, "Where are you?" No
answer. He ran to a window and smashed it with his fist in a sort of
vague hope to get light and air. Again and again he called as he went
along the front wall feeling sure the child would be there. Suddenly he
saw her crouching in the farthest corner. He picked her up at once and
ran as well as he could towards the ladder. As he put his foot on the
first step, she began to scream and struggle. No wonder: it seemed to
her as if they were going into the heart of the furnace which was
roaring beneath them. Tryon held her firmly and went down a few steps
carefully to get beneath the floor. The heat was too frightful; he
could go no further. As he turned on the ladder he felt almost sure
that he couldn't jump beyond the flames. But there was nothing else to
be done. Holding the child tightly to him with his left arm, he sprang
out with desperate effort.</p>

<p>So far he was fully conscious and sensible. But in his determination
to protect the child, he had jumped in such a way that if he fell his
right arm would sustain the shock. As he landed on the floor and
pitched forward just clear of the flames, his right arm snapped under
his weight. His consciousness seemed to turn to sick agony. He rolled
over on his back, and he had to push with the broken arm to regain his
balance and rise tohis feet. Each time, too, he put his right foot to
the ground, he grew faint. How he got forward, he never knew. But the
will in him held, sharpened now by a dread which was all instinctive.
Of a sudden as it seemed to him, he reached the window; he saw the
fireman's hand on the sill; he pushed the child against it. In an
instant the fireman had taken the child, lifted her over the sill and
disappeared with her down the ladder. With the removal of his burden,
Tryon seemed to lose his purpose and almost his senses. A sick
faintness came over him and he sank down against the sill without
strength sufficient to put his leg over it, much less to descend the
ladder. His force was spent. But the fresh air revived him a little,
and the intense pain of his wrist rousing him to a sense of danger,
moved him to a last effort. Slowly and with infinite pain he got his
right leg over the sill, and so lay astride upon it, half unconscious,
incapable of movement. But the crowd below, much more interested in him
than in the saved child, shouted to the firemen, two of whom, realising
his state, ran up the ladder almost side by side. Just as the foremost
reached him, there came another crash, and, as the third floor fell in,
the imprisoned flames sprang up round Tryon, as if reluctant to lose
their prey. For a moment the crowd saw him in the heart of the fire,
and then he was dragged down on to the ladder and held in front of the
firemen, who began to descend slowly, letting the unconscious body
slide after them. As he passed the light of the second storey it
appeared to everyone in the crowd that Tryon was dead. So limp helay
and helpless, with the right hand bent back, like a broken stick which
hangs only by the bark.</p>

<p>As the men reached the ground and bore him across the street and
laid him on the pavement not a sound was to be heard, save the
hysterical sobbing of the negro-girl. A few moments passed, moments of
intense anxiety to thousands who didn't even know Tryon's name, and
then as the doctor stood up with, "I think he'll bear carrying," a wave
of joy went through the crowd, and tears came into many eyes unused to
weeping. Stretched on a mattrass he was borne still unconscious to his
mother's house. The crowd followed quietly; the interest in the fire
was lost in this deeper interest. As the doctor reached the door just
before the bearers, it was opened to him by Mrs. Tryon.</p>

<p>In a few hasty words he told her of her son's daring, and assured
her that he thought he would pull through. The mother took the sentence
without flinching, and candle in hand showed the way into her own
bedroom on the ground floor. As the bearers emerged from the house and
closed the street-door after them, the crowd began to move away. It
occurred to them at last that the night was far advanced. But still
they went in groups talking and discussing the story.</p>

<p>"Jack Whatman said it couldn't he done. The smoke was awful. . . .
All for a nigger-girl. I'll just be damned. He has sand in him. . . .
But why did <em>he</em> go? Not I for a nigger, . . . He's broke his
arm. And leg! Did ye hear the nigger cryin'? I guess he was more
worth'n a pile of nigger girls. . . . The doctor thinks he'll
live.He'll never be as good a man again. Never! . . . What'll Boulger
say? What'll he do? He's insured, I guess. You bet. He ain't no fool.
The nigger might have burned for him. He'll get the greenbacks. . . .
Who d'ye think will be manager now?"</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_8">IV</a></h3>

<p>Mr. Boulger drove into Kansas City very early the morning after the
fire so as to catch Tryon alone before the store opened; he had a
difficult and unpleasant task to perform. It was manifest to him that
Tryon, in spite of his resolute manner, was "lettin' things slide." He
had gone to business again and again with the intention of pressing
Tryon to immediate action, but somehow or other he felt it impossible
even to approach the subject when he came face to face with his strong
manager. Yet, since their compact had been settled he had never entered
the store with any other object. And this for a good reason. He knew
that Tryon had taken control of the business as master; he felt that
his presence in the store under these circumstances would be a tacit
recognition of Tryon's position and authority, and that it would be
difficult for him later to turn the whilom manager into a subordinate.
Accordingly, he had determined not to go to the store till afterwards,
when he could at once show Tryon his true position. Tryon, he felt, was
altogether too masterful, and besides, he was young and inexperienced.
In fact, it was almost impossible for Mr. Boulgerto contemplate any one
as manager of the business which he flattered himself he and he alone
understood in all its bearings. Tryon's astonishing knowledge of the
business in its details and possible development was a perpetual
annoyance to his employer. Mr. Boulger liked to ask questions which no
one could answer; it showed his superior intelligence. But Tryon had an
answer to all relevant questions, and he simply did not hear irrelevant
ones. His knowledge was insulting. Then, too, Mr. Boulger liked to make
suggestions, to propose new schemes by which the business might be
developed. And Tryon had either put these schemes into operation
already or else was prepared to demonstrate their impracticability. He
was always so d&mdash;&mdash;-d conceited. And this conceit enraged Mr.
Boulger. Again and again he had made up his mind not to go near the
store till&mdash; But yes, he'd just look in for a moment and ask
carelessly, "Well, Dave, is everything goin on all right?" No one but
Tryon could understand that. And a word in reply would be sufficient.
That was all he wanted&mdash;to know the thing was movin'. But 'twas
impossible to ask the question. There was Tryon directing, managing
everything, pretending to be very busy, scarcely vouchsafing a word to
him, who, after all, was not only the owner, but knew more of the
business than any one else could possibly know. 'Twas exasperatin', and
he didn't intend to put up with such treatment any longer.</p>

<p>For all the while Tryon was just tradin' on his generosity. 'Twas
all very well for him to playmanager and take five thousand dollars a
year; to talk and whisper to Georgie as if he were already her husband;
but what had he done for it all? Nothin'. Nothin' as yet anyway. And
perhaps&mdash;perhaps he didn't mean to do anythin'? Who could tell?
Mr. Boulger grew cold with fear at the thought, and then viciously
angry. He'd put down his foot. He wasn't to be fooled easily; he knew a
thing or two; he could play a game as well as the next man. Damn him!
He'd show him that kindness, generosity, yes, generosity, didn't mean
foolishness&mdash;wasn't to be played with. And so this very morning he
told Georgie that she was altogether too free with Tryon. She shouldn't
talk to him in the store. It didn't look well. She was treating him as
if he were her husband, and those daily visits to his mother were out
of place&mdash;altogether out of place.</p>

<p>The girl had regarded him with astonishment, and her astonishment
brought him to a standstill. He saw he had gone too far.</p>

<p>Of course, he thought a pile of Tryon. Tryon was hard working, and
'twould all come right with time, he guessed; but there was no use in
goin' too fast. Girls shouldn't go too fast; 'twarn't their place, and
so forth&mdash;the reproaches dying away into weak generalities.</p>

<p>But the consciousness of this impotent conclusion only exasperated
him the more with Tryon. "Was he or was he not goin' to do the work?
And if so, when?" These were the questions to which Mr. Boulger
resolved to get an immediate answer, and as he drove into the city he
made uphis mind that he would grasp the thistle firmly. He wouldn't
give Tryon any more time; he had given more than enough already.
Besides, time was everythin' in this matter. That bill of Stewart's
pressed, and Tryon knew about it. 'Twas too bad of Tryon to keep him in
such anxiety. 'Twarn't fair of him. No, he'd have an answer at last.
He'd insist on having one.</p>

<p>Immersed in such reflections as these, Mr. Boulger reached Lee
Street. Owing partly to the earliness of the hour, and partly to his
own preoccupation, he had almost reached the store before noticing
anything unusual. But as he turned into Lee Street at the very block
whereon his house of business stood, he banished thought and looked
about him. The street seemed crowded; people had come to business
earlier than usual. What was that? Impulsively he drew the reins tight,
and his trotter's speed quickened to racing pace. In another minute,
with white face and trembling lips, he was in front of the blackened
four walls, from which smoke was still issuing&mdash;the walls which
but yesterday had been his store. Paralyzed with amazement and fear he
sat in the buggy staring. The surprise stood him in good stead.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Boulger, you look astonished?" The sarcastic interrogation
came from the agent of a New York Insurance Company, which stood to pay
Mr. Boulger a hundred thousand dollars&mdash;if, indeed, the fire was
an accident. The agent, a young and able man who commanded the respect
of his colleagues, had a very strong suspicion that this fire, so
extraordinary in its completeness, wasnot due to mere chance; but when
he saw turned upon him Mr. Boulger's white face, trembling lips and
vacant stare of wonder, all his doubts disappeared. This man evidently
knew nothing of the catastrophe, and as he was the only party
interested&mdash;Mr. Jenkins at once changed his tone.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you heard the news?"</p>

<p>"When&mdash;?" The interrogation caused Mr. Boulger a gulp.</p>

<p>"Between nine and ten last night. 'Twas all over by twelve, before
that German and his wife got back from their doggoned festival. I guess
he had left somethin' burnin'. But hain't you heard of Tryon, your
manager? Every one's talkin' of him."</p>

<p>Mr. Boulger shook his head; fear seized him. What about Tryon? For
the life of him he couldn't have uttered a word. Then, as the crowd
gathered about his buggy, Mr. Boulger heard the whole story. As he
listened to the curt phrases which seemed to sharpen the edges of the
tragedy and to lend weight to the praise of Tryon's conduct, Mr.
Boulger's muscles relaxed, and his face gradually regained its colour
and ordinary expression. What should he say? He felt that Jenkins was
takin' him in and postin' him up. The enthusiasm with which the crowd
listened to the meagre statement of what Tryon had done, gave Mr.
Boulger his cue.</p>

<p>"Well, the fire's bad enough for me, but I'd lose twice as much to
know that Tryon was out of danger." With the actor's instinct, which is
inseparable from vanity, he saw from the faces of thepeople that he had
struck the right note, and so he went on. "Why, he's engaged to my
daughter! I must go right off and see him. What'll&mdash;" From a dozen
men came words of approval and sympathy. Mr. Boulger glowed with
pleasure; he felt at ease again, but his inventive faculty was neither
facile nor profound.</p>

<p>"Georgie'll want to know whether there's any hope. I&mdash;" The
chord seemed false, not equal to the diapason of popular sympathy and
reverence. Mr. Boulger felt that he had made a mistake, but having to
say something, struck the right key immediately, with&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'll fetch my daughter: she'll do him good, I guess." Again the
murmur of approval; and forthwith he drove rapidly up the street
homewards. Again his impressionable nature had served him better than
any calculation could have done. As Mr. Boulger turned and drove away
without even a word to him, Jenkins, the insurance agent, felt his last
doubts removed. Clearly Boulger knew nothing of the tragedy and feared
no investigation; he wasn't conciliatory, not polite even. So Mr.
Jenkins set himself to think how he could turn this knowledge to
account. Utterly unconscious of the effect he had produced, or of its
importance, Mr. Boulger drove on in a whirl of emotions and
thoughts.</p>

<p>He was glad. Yes. The store was burned clean out; the insurance
money was safe; he was all right; Stewart's bill all right too; but
what did it all mean? Tryon wounded and badly burnt was to him a source
of dread. What mightn'thappen? He might be delirious; might begin to
talk; might&mdash;God, what bad luck!</p>

<p>"He might die&mdash;without speakin'." Mr. Boulger felt a warm
thrill of pleasure run through him at the thought. "But nothin' ever
turns out quite right&mdash;nothin'. Still he might. Who knows? The men
seemed to say he was very bad."</p>

<p>With the feeling that Tryon was pretty sure to die, Mr. Boulger was
conscious of a certain pity and almost affection for him. "Poor devil,
it's hard on him; he did the thing well;" but as the thought came again
that perhaps Tryon might "let out" something instead of dying quietly,
the pity gave place in Mr. Boulger to a sort of surprised indignation
not unmixed with contempt.</p>

<p>"What did he want tryin' to save a nigger girl? Why didn't he go
quietly home and let the store burn? 'Twas foolish goin' back. And then
to try what the fireman said was impossible. That was just like him; he
always knew better than any one else: he'd never take good advice-he
deserved what he had got."</p>

<p>Mr. Boulger thought with warm self-satisfaction how differently he'd
have acted had he been in Tryon's place. He'd have just gone in at the
window, as the fireman did, and then come out again; that would have
looked well, and would have cost nothin'. No. Tryon wasn't really
smart&mdash;he wasn't; he was rather stupid; hard-working, yes, but
slow&mdash;dull, that was the word, dull.</p>

<p>"Would he die? That was the point."</p>

<p>And how would Georgie take it? She'd get onher high horse, he felt,
and play the fool; girls always did; they hadn't any sense. Mr. Boulger
realised with a sting of keen annoyance that he could do nothing to
restrain his daughter. Tryon, he felt, had got into favour with the
people and&mdash;yes, that was a good thing for him, too. The insurance
companies would make no fuss about payin'. Well, so far, at any rate,
it had gone all right, and if Tryon had got hurt, 'twas his own fault;
and if Georgie acted foolish, that was her business. After all, he
couldn't force her to be sensible.</p>

<p>With such thoughts as these in his mind, Mr. Boulger drew up at his
own door. As he gave the reins to a negro boy, and thought of what he
should say to Georgie, the popular feeling came back to him in all its
strength, and he resolved to act as if he admired Tryon. And he did
admire him: very few would have done what he did, and if 'twas foolish,
well, after all, so far it had done no harm&mdash;rather the contrary,
in fact.</p>

<p>As he entered the sitting-room, Georgie came to meet him, startled
by his quick return and by the unwonted seriousness of his manner.
Scarcely had he begun his story, when she interrupted him:</p>

<p>"And Mr. Tryon? Is he&mdash;?" and she flushed crimson.</p>

<p>In spite of himself, he answered her excitement with direct
narration. As soon as he had finished the story she left the room
hurriedly. But Mr. Boulger went on talking; Tryon's heroism impressed
him while he described it; he thought it wise, too, to add that though
he was insured, yet,of course, he'd have to lose something. 'Twould
take three or four months, workin' night and day, to rebuild the store;
and, as Tryon was in bed, he'd have to direct everythin' himself. But
then 'twould be better done. So p'r'aps 'twas just as well. His
women-folk didn't receive his self-gratulation as sympathetically as
usual, and this made Mr. Boulger feel ill at ease. In truth, they were
more moved than they cared to show. Ada felt sorry that she had treated
Tryon with contempt; perhaps, she thought, if she had encouraged him a
little&mdash;. Ivy regretted that she had yielded the place so quickly
to Georgie, and thought Georgie ought to be very grateful to her,
still. Mrs. Boulger condescended to say that the young man had acted
very well&mdash;"'twas a pity he had had no advantages." Then Georgie
came into the room dressed to go out. "Let's go, father," she said, and
at once Mr. Boulger yielded. He felt 'twould look well to take her in
without loss of time; 'twould be the right thing to do; only&mdash;</p>

<p>On their way into town the girl drew from him the whole story over
again. And Mr. Boulger felt it to be impossible to warn her, as he had
meant to do. Her seriousness kept him at bay. She shivered as she
passed the store. The smoke rising from the roofless building, the
height of the third storey, appalled her. And the glimpse of blue sky
she caught through the blackened windows chilled her with apprehension.
She almost took it as an omen.</p>

<p>They had been in the front room but a moment or two when Mrs. Tryon
came in. She was calm,but very pale. Impulsively Georgie took a step or
two towards her, and then, stopping, burst into tears. The mother's
strong, silent grief frightened her. But Mr. Boulger said:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tryon, we've come to ask after Dave; we hope he's not much
hurt. And if we could do anything for him, we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's very ill," Mrs. Tryon spoke quietly, "and I mustn't leave him
long. The doctor says he may be&mdash;lame for life, even if he ever
recovers. And his arm's broken, too. But I feel he'll get well; he must
get well. He's not conscious sometimes, but he lies quite still and
never complains. My boy! The doctor says everybody is talking of him,"
and the mother's lip quivered. "But now I must go to him; I hear him
stirring," and she passed noiselessly into the sick-room.</p>

<p>Mr. Boulger was so relieved to know that Tryon lay quite still that
he felt almost grateful to him, and forgave Georgie her tears. In a few
moments Mrs. Tryon returned.</p>

<p>"He wants to see you," she said to Georgie coldly; "but you must
take care and not excite him. The doctor said that would be bad for
him; and you mustn't cry nor make a noise." As the girl turned towards
her a tear-wet face, the large-hearted woman added more
sympathetically, "There, it'll be all right, I guess. There! dry your
eyes and come; it'll do him good to see you." What it cost her to add
the last phrase, only a woman can understand.</p>

<p>With a great effort Georgie dried her eyes and disappeared into the
room after Mrs. Tryon. Thecolloquy didn't last long. In ten minutes she
was again in the buggy with her father.</p>

<p>"Well, what did he say?"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he only asked me to read the letter if&mdash;if he died."
Georgie's eyes filled as she spoke. "He looked terrible&mdash;all
black; his mother says that'll go off, but oh, I hope his eyebrows will
grow again. And he's so weak. Father, do you think he'll ever get well?
He could scarcely speak; he just lay and looked at us, and whispered.
Oh, I hope&mdash;I hope he won't die," and again Georgie burst into
tears. The catastrophe had not upset her as much as Mrs. Tryon's strong
self-repression which she felt was born of dread.</p>

<p>"He'll get well, I guess," replied Mr. Boulger, to soothe her. "In a
month he'll be up and about again; but, Georgie, remember you weren't
to open that letter unless we both wanted you to. He can't alter that
now. 'Twouldn't be right, would it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, father!" the girl cried reproachfully, "I must do what he asked
me. I said I would."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Mr. Boulger, "we'll have time to think over that."
His resignation came from the sudden reflection that if Georgie
insisted upon opening the letter he'd tell her that his promise to pay
Tryon a hundred thousand dollars was given on condition that they were
married&mdash;as a wedding-present, in fact.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="1_0_9">V</a></h3>

<p>About six weeks later Tryon and his bride were seated side by side
near the open window in the sitting-room of his mother's house. Half
reclining in an easy chair with his right arm in a sling, he looked
anything but strong. Yet though his face was thin and drawn, the eyes
were bright and a spot of colour on the cheeks made him appear better
than he was. He was excited a little by the thought that this was the
day fixed for the presentation by the mayor and chief dignitaries of
the city of the cheque for five thousand dollars which had been
collected for him. Tryon felt no incongruity in this testimonial of
respect and admiration. His direct and practical nature had from the
beginning looked upon the saving of the girl as atonement for setting
fire to the store. Whenever he thought of that night, and he thought of
it but seldom, for his sufferings and slow convalescence had removed it
into the far past, it seemed to him that he had been punished more than
sufficiently. It was the future which occupied his mind.</p>

<p>Even on this occasion the lovers' talk was of the new store, for
Georgie's tenderness excited by admiration took interest for the time
being only in what interested her lover.</p>

<p>"Father says everything shall be done as you wish, and the side-door
you wanted near the front-entrance is already half made. It looks so
small and cute. The foreman told me the building goes up three feet in
every twenty-four hours, andthere's not a store east of the Mississippi
river as strongly built. He says it'll be quite fire-proof," and the
girl shivered as she spoke.</p>

<p>"It'll be finished then in twenty days more," said Tryon
thoughtfully, "and all roofed in about the time we're married; then
we'll go and see it, won't we? I want to arrange everything inside
myself. We must have show-room enough. When goods are crowded, nothin'
looks well. I wish 'twas the twenty-fourth of September to-day; don't
you, Georgie?" And he kissed her as he spoke. The girl nodded her head,
smiling with eyes wide open, in tender joy and gladness.</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened and Mrs. Tryon came in, followed by
Mr. Boulger. Mrs. Tryon had regained her usual cheerful manner. Mr.
Boulger seemed handsomer than ever. Clearly prosperity agreed with him.
The truth was that the public feeling for Tryon had carried him away on
its strong tide. It was impossible to his vanity to be left out of the
flow of expansive good feeling. And he had thought of a means of
playing a conspicuous part in the honour about to be paid to Tryon.</p>

<p>"Dave," he said cheerfully smiling. "I congratulate you. Now you've
got into this room, you'll soon be allowed out and then, then," he
said, laying his hand on his daughter's head, "you'll soon get into the
church, eh? And you deserve it all. There's no question about that. But
now before the Mayor and Committee come, I want a word with you alone,
and Mrs. Tryon declares you'll be able to bear it. Eh, Mrs. Tryon?"</p>

<p>The mother smiled pleasantly, and taking Georgie's arm left the
room.</p>

<p>"Dave, it's just this. The insurance money has all been paid, every
cent. 'Twas Jenkins started it: he got a good advertisement by bein'
the first. 'The Banner' just whooped it right along, talked of his
business energy, and all the other agents followed suit when the
preachers began gettin' up the subscription for you. The money's all in
the bank now, and if it hadn't been for you I'd have left it there.
I've worked long enough, but you want your turn, and so the store's
bein' rebuilt. That'll cost a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, with
fittings complete. Fifty thousand dollars must stand for current
expenses, and I think four hundred thousand dollars'll be enough for
stock. Six hundred thousand dollars in all. Now what do you say? I
propose to put in the six hundred thousand and take you in as partner
to the extent of a fourth share for the note which Georgie has. I say a
fourth instead of a fifth so as to make up for your salary as manager.
I guess that's fair, ain't it?" (Tryon nodded.) "Well, I've had the
deeds of partnership drawn out to be signed on your marriage with
Georgie, and I thought if you were agreed I'd just announce the fact
to-day. 'Twouldn't look well if I was the only person to do nothin' on
such a day to show my appreciation of you. I guess Boulger, Tryon and
Co. will do over the entrance, eh?" And Mr. Boulger's face shone with
the consciousness of kindly generosity.</p>

<p>For all answer Tryon held out his left hand witha smile of
acceptance. To him the proposition seemed highly advantageous; he knew
what he could do with the business, and if it had been revealed to him
that Mr. Boulger's chief reason for making the proposal was that he
imagined he would have more control over a junior partner than he could
have over a strong-willed and popular manager who, with a hundred
thousand dollars at his back could always set up for himself, and might
become a dangerous competitor, Tryon would only have smiled dryly. He
knew that work tends to fall into the hands that can do it.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the street in which the Tryons lived began to
fill with people. "The Banner" had insisted upon the desirability of a
popular demonstration in honour of David Tryon, and the people were
nothing loath to lighten the monotonous grind of life with a new and
interesting celebration.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of waiting the crowd opened to allow free
passage to the Mayor, Judge Whatley of the District Court, and the Rev.
Mr. Jackson of the First Episcopal Church. As this committee entered
the house the people cheered. After the usual greetings, the Mayor
cleared his throat and began his speech, every word of which was heard
through the open windows by the listening crowd.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tryon, it would be impossible, and I think it's unnecessary for
me to tell you how deeply your courage and unselfish heroism have moved
the hearts of your fellow-citizens. I have never seen anything like it.
You have had our sympathy inyour sufferings; we rejoice in your
restoration to health. Sir, we feel that you are an honour even to this
great community, and it has been unanimously resolved in full City
Council that this committee should express to you our appreciation of
your conduct and should present you with this cheque for five thousand
dollars as a token of the admiration which every citizen feels for your
heroism. Sir, I'm proud to shake your hand."</p>

<p>Having suited the action to the word the sturdy hardware
manufacturer moved a step or two to the rear amid the cheers of the
crowd outside.</p>

<p>Judge Whatley spoke briefly in much the same strain, and then amid
the renewed cheers of the populace Mr. Jackson began. Highly nervous
and vain, but intensely matter-of-fact, he had been the first to
propose to his congregation on the Sunday after the fire to make up for
Tryon's unmerited suffering by a general subscription. His initiative
had been followed; he was now modestly elated by his success and the
position he held as mouthpiece. His reed-like piping came as a relief
after the loud voice of the Mayor, and the hard high clearness of the
Judge's utterance.</p>

<p>"I have been sent here, Mr. Tryon, to give unanimous expression to
the feeling of Christians and Christian teachers in regard to your
action. No words of mine can convey our admiration of it. 'Greater love
hath no man than this that he lay down his life for his friend,' and
yet to save the life of a coloured girl-child, a stranger, you
imperilled your life and almost lost it. Your action was an emanation
from the spirit of the Masterhimself. Every person in this city, and
many outside its limits, will be better men and women because of your
deed. That is your reward. The money subscribed is but an expression of
our admiration and gratitude&mdash;a thanks-offering to you for an act
of Christian self-sacrifice and heroism such as has rarely been
recorded in the annals of Time. It is as a Christian hero that we all
value you, and hope that your life may be a long and happy one."</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson's words were listened to in respectful silence by the
crowd, as by those inside the room. It was felt with a sort of
astonishment that he had "put Tryon away up," and that Tryon deserved
the honour paid him. As Mr. Jackson drew back, Tryon said simply, "I
thank you, gentlemen, for your kindness."</p>

<p>In the pause which ensued Mr. Boulger found his opportunity. His
vanity moved him to speech with irresistible force; his
impressionability helped him to words.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,&mdash;I'd like to be allowed to say a few
words, for in this matter I naturally feel strongly. I know David Tryon
well, I've known him for years. I was glad when he came to work for me;
I advanced him from clerk to cashier, and then made him manager, and I
can say truly that I had learned to esteem him before the fire took
place. I look upon him as a hero, and I'm proud to think he's going to
be my son-in-law and my partner. Yes, sir, the firm of Boulger will in
future be known as Boulger, Tryon and Co. I guess it'll get along all
right. Dave's young,but he's a hero, as Mr. Jackson has said, a
Christian hero."</p>

<p>While Mr. Boulger covered his inability to find further words by
shaking the Mayor vigorously by the hand, Tryon sat in silence. The
cheering of the crowd, the eulogies pronounced upon his conduct moved
him to momentary self-question.</p>

<p>" A hero? Had all heroes been like&mdash;"</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_10">THE INTERPRETER (A MERE
EPISODE)</a></h3>

<p> </p>

<p class="l">I WAS in the entrance hall of the Hotel de Roma in Madrid.
I had come downstairs to see if I could get an interpreter or competent
guide to accompany my wife to the Museum of the Prado, whilst I went
off with a Toreador to a rustic wedding. There was a man in the hall
who rather puzzled me; he was not well dressed enough for a visitor to
the hotel; yet his eye did not seek mine with the servile solicitation
which is the mark of the guide tribe in all civilized capitals, nor did
he show that dignified indifference to one's obvious wants which is, so
to say, the livery of the Spaniard in quest of employment. He was about
the middle height, of commonplace appearance; but there was something
in the thoughtful quietude of his look and manner that pleased me. As
there was nothing for it but to speak to him, I made up my mind to
speak in English: "Good morning."</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," he answered quietly. His tone encouraged
me.</p>

<p>"Do you happen to be an interpreter?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, I am not an interpreter." There was something subdued, half
melancholy, in his tone, but he was a Spaniard; the r's betrayed him
unmistakably.</p>

<p>"What a bore," I said disconsolately, turning half aside;
"Mazzantini will be waiting for me, and I wanted some one to go with my
wife to the Museum."</p>

<p>"I shall be happy to accompany Madame," said the Spaniard, "and if
Madame cares for paintings, she will have emotions in the Prado."</p>

<p>"Thanks, as you are not a guide, I must not trouble you."</p>

<p>"I often go with people to the Prado," he answered simply.</p>

<p>"But then," I went on with British love of a fact, "you must be
either an interpreter or a guide."</p>

<p>"I am not an interpreter," he replied abruptly, his manner almost
rude as he turned away.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, feeling my mistake, "at any rate you speak English
better than any Spaniard I have met, and I dare say you know more about
the pictures than the ordinary guide."</p>

<p>He turned to me, lifting his eyebrows in deprecating pity, and as my
wife appeared at the moment, I confided her to his charge. When we met
before dinner my wife spoke of him: "Such a strange man&mdash;so
terribly enthusiastic. He bored me to extinction about Velasquez, and
seemed quite hurt because I could not appreciate&mdash;'las
Meni&ntilde;as,' yes, that was the name&mdash;a quite absurd picture.
Polite? Oh yes, for a foreigner and a man in his position." After this
I met the man frequently, and often talked with him. I found that he
knew a great deal about the Spanish school of painting, andespecially
about Velasquez and Goya; but his knowledge was curiously fragmentary.
He had evidently divined more than he had read, and his ideas about men
and things had grown to have all the weight of facts for his mind.
There was, too, a curious mixture of self-assertion and humility about
him which I could not account for. I ventured to ask him, one evening,
how he had come to learn so much about painting, and especially about
Velasquez. He went on twirling a cigarette between his yellow-stained
fingers, while his little brown eyes contracted with the effort of
thinking. After a pause, he said:</p>

<p>"I was in the Prado every day, and somehow or other the little
pictures grew hideous to me and the masterpieces more and more
interesting.</p>

<p>"That's a rare experience," I said, "but not singular; I have a
friend who declares that no one can really understand a picture till he
has lived with it. But of course there are people who can appreciate
even a masterpiece at first sight." As I saw he didn't agree with me, I
went on probing: "Surely you must have got some of your knowledge from
books?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied indifferently, "what I knew before, I found in
books and little else. But most people like what they call facts, so I
read in order to get facts. But I am so constituted that I can only
remember such facts as possess some vital or spiritual significance, so
I am not much better off for all my reading. Other men's knowledge
doesn't help one much."</p>

<p>"Then you have always been a guide and interpreter?" I
interrupted.</p>

<p>He turned upon me abruptly in a revolt of conceit:</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Se&ntilde;or, I was an interpreter once. I did not only
interpret our language, but the pictures of our greatest masters in the
Prado to ordinary visitors. You know that as a rule people do not see
pictures at all until their beauties have been pointed out to them.
Well, I revealed to Englishmen, Frenchmen and Germans the immortal
works of Zurbaran, Velasquez, and Goya. And when there were any willing
to listen, I went further and showed them how these masters had
discovered their souls in their paintings; and thus I interpreted to
foreign tourists the spiritual essence of our greatest. Ah, it was
strange! For one who admired the strength and dignity of Zurbaran there
were a dozen who loved the brutality of Goya, and the voluptuousness of
his <i>mayas</i>; and for a score who understood Zurbaran, there was
only one to care for the soul of Velasquez, who saw dwarfs and kings,
ministers and women, horses and dogs, as God's sunlight sees them.
Curious, isn't it? that only the noble can love nobility, and that a
thousand wanted me to translate to them some silly piece of newspaper
scandal for one who wished to understand how Velasquez felt towards
Christ, . . . I began as a democrat," he went on, as if to himself,
"but I soon came to hate and despise the people. Nine men out of ten
have no reverence in them, no desire to learn and grow. I used to think
my trade the best in the world,"he broke off,&mdash;"in itself an
education that refines and ennobles. Yes, oh yes," he repeated, nodding
his head, while a sort of flush came over his sallow cheeks, "I was an
interpreter&mdash;once."</p>

<p>In spite of his self-assertion the man impressed me; I noticed now a
certain intellectuality in his breadth of brow and patient insistence
in his peering eyes; his mouth, too, was very sensitive and refined.
But underneath my sympathy there was the prickling of vulgar curiosity,
and after a certain amount of lighter talk I couldn't help asking
him:</p>

<p>"Why did you tell me the first evening that you were not an
interpreter? And why don't you wear the band on your cap?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and said nothing. I pressed him, and at
length he spoke:</p>

<p>"When the visitors found out I was a real interpreter, they began to
recommend me to their friends, and I got constant employment, more than
I could do; and as I got money, I grew proud. The proprietor let me
have rooms in the hotel. . . .</p>

<p>"One day, out of the season, an English gentleman, called Mr.
Ponsonby, came here, and after spending a day in his room, he asked me
what there was to do in this dull place, and I took him to the Prado.
He was very affable and quick, and liked all I told him. He said I
ought to have a great reputation, and when I said I thought I had, he
said he did not mean that sort of reputation. I ought to write down
what I knew about the painters, and the book would sell, and make me a
reputation throughout Europe. We passed theevening together in this
<i>caf&eacute;</i>; see, at that table. All the next day, too, we spent
together; he did not seem to want to be alone; it was so damned dull,
he said, without anyone to talk to. He always read the English
newspapers as soon as they came. Except for that time, I was with him
every minute for three days.</p>

<p>"On the fourth morning, about nine o'clock, I was in the hail
waiting for him, when suddenly there came up to me my sister's
husband's brother's son, the youngest of the family. He was in the
police and had got on. I had known him as a baby, and played with him
often; his third name was Jos&eacute;, after me. We began to talk. I
asked him about the family; they all live in Toledo. And so we passed
about ten minutes; then he said to me:</p>

<p>"'Are you doing anything now? Why don't you go and see them?'</p>

<p>"'Ah, no,' I replied; 'I stick to my work. Besides, I have an
English gentleman here now, who takes me everywhere with him; such a
nice gentleman, a Mr. Ponsonby.'</p>

<p>"'Is he in the hotel now?' he asked.</p>

<p>"'He is in his room; I am waiting for him,' was my answer.</p>

<p>"'Take me up to him, won't you? I think I have something to tell
him&mdash;or something for him.'</p>

<p>"I forget exactly what he said; but I replied: 'All right, come
on.'</p>

<p>"I was sure Mr. Ponsonby would not be angry with me; he was so
pleasant, and I, like a vain fool, never paused to think. We went up to
theroom, and I knocked at the door. Mr. Ponsonby asked sharply: 'Who's
there?' and I said:</p>

<p>"'It is I, Mr. Ponsonby, your guide, Jos&eacute;, who&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Then we heard him unlocking the door.</p>

<p>"As he opened it I began: 'Mr. Ponsonby, I have brought&mdash;'; but
before I could finish, my sister's husband's brother's son stepped
before me, and put his hand on Mr. Ponsonby's shoulder, saying in
English (I did not know he knew a word of it):</p>

<p>"'Mr. Ponsonby Pigott, you must come with me.'</p>

<p>"I still did not understand, and I was a little angry at being
pushed aside, so I went forward and asked him:</p>

<p>"'What do you mean?'</p>

<p>"He looked at me with a smile and said: 'Mr. Pigott understands; he
is my prisoner.'</p>

<p>"Then I knew, and I said to my sister's husband's brother's son:</p>

<p>"'You have made me a spy like yourself, you devil. You have made me
help to give my friend up, you low beast, you . . .' and I went on. I
was mad with rage, because I felt the guilt in myself; but Mr. Ponsonby
Pigott, he did not reproach me. He was too much of a gentleman; he grew
a little pale, that was all.</p>

<p>"Pointing to the alcove where the bed stood, he asked the detective:
'May I go to get my brushes and things?'</p>

<p>"I stepped in front of the young man, and said:</p>

<p>"'Certainly, Mr. Ponsonby Pigott, you shall get what you like; he
does not dare to disturb you.'</p>

<p>"Oh, I was determined to be a fine fool to the end! When he went to
the alcove, I turned to my sister's husband's brother's son, and I spat
on the floor and said&mdash;What did I not say? I have not forgiven
him; he will see yet.</p>

<p>"All the while I was thinking what a brute I had been and fool, to
be outwitted by a boy. Suddenly there came a click, and&mdash;as the
detective rushed past me&mdash;the bang of a revolver. When we got to
the alcove, there he lay, Mr. Ponsonby who had been so kind to me, all
huddled up on the floor&mdash;with his brains scattered on the pillow
and the wall&mdash;dead.</p>

<p>"Then I knew what I had done, and I turned and went out of the room,
and in the hall they all met me, and asked:</p>

<p>"'What is the matter, Interpreter?'</p>

<p>"And I took the band on my cap with 'Interpreter' on it, and I tore
it off my cap, and I said:</p>

<p>"'I am no interpreter, I am a fool.'</p>

<p>"I went out crying&mdash;</p>

<p align="center" class="cen">* * * * *</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"Yes, I've heard he was a forger and a cheat; he may have been a bad
man; but whatever crimes be committed, there was something kindly in
him and noble; at all events he knew when to die. . . .</p>

<p>"I was greatly to blame, greatly; I was too self-sufficient and
proud. That is why I will never wear the badge again nor call myself an
interpreter. I am not worthy of the name; but if Mr.Pigott had liked me
as I liked him, and trusted me, I would have hidden him away here in
Madrid, so that they would never have found him, never. I cannot bear
to think of it now, he was so pleasant and kind&mdash;"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_11">SONIA</a></h3>

<p> </p>

<p class="l">IT was a chance meeting&mdash;pure chance, if indeed there
is such a thing. I was giving a sort of farewell dinner to people I had
met in Munich; in another ten minutes I should have been in my own room
and have missed her. She had only stopped with her mother to rest for
the night on the way from Paris to Vienna and had come downstairs by
chance&mdash;chance?</p>

<p>How well I remember the meeting! It was in the smoking-room of the
Vierjahreszeiten Hotel. A couple of professors, some men from the
embassies, and a captain of Uhlans had been dining with me. The dinner
had been dull; our talk had gradually degenerated into spasmodic
remarks; and in spite of the efforts of the French
<i>attach&eacute;</i> to be witty in a language he had only a
smattering of, I had come to the conclusion that specialists do not
make good company, when suddenly I saw a face&mdash;a girl's
face&mdash;looking through the upper part of the glass door. It
disappeared, and I was just hoping that my guests would go away soon
when the door opened and the girl came into the room and took a seat at
the table almost opposite me. The room was a public room, usually used
for smoking and coffee, but in Germany one does not expect to see a
young woman act with independence and I was a little surprised. The
curious part of the matter is that from the moment sheentered I
remember everything that happened&mdash;every word she said, each of
her slightest gestures&mdash;with extraordinary vividness. At first she
was silent. She merely drew the black lace <i>mantilla</i> she was
wearing a little further forward on her head and then let her eyes rest
for a moment or two, first on one man and then on the next. There was
nothing impertinent in her scrutiny, no curiosity even; the glance
seemed merely meditative and impersonal; but the French
<i>attach&eacute;</i> instinctively twisted his moustache to a bolder
curve. When the eyes that had travelled round the half circle met mine,
I was curiously interested. Was it the girl's indifference to the other
men that piqued me? or was there something really impressive in her
calm self-possession?</p>

<p>My looks must have betrayed the interest I felt in her; for she
suddenly spoke to me in French, "You're not a German, are you?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied in the same tongue, "I am English. These gentlemen
are guests of mine." Then taking my courage in both hands, I added, "If
I had the pleasure of knowing your name, I would introduce them to
you."</p>

<p>"No, please not," she said, quickly disposing of my attempt to bring
my friends into the conversation; "I am glad you are English; I have
wanted to know an Englishman for a long time." She spoke quickly, but
with long pauses between the sentences; the effect was to heighten
one's interest in what she was saying.</p>

<p>"I hope I may consider that as a compliment," I replied inanely. I
never talked so stupidly as tothis girl on whom already I wished to
make a good impression.</p>

<p>"Scarcely," she retorted with imperturbable seriousness; "the
reverse, I think."</p>

<p>"Really," I exclaimed in amazement, "may I ask why?"</p>

<p>"It is plain; but&mdash;your guests are going."</p>

<p>And so they were. Headed by the French <i>attach&eacute;</i>, with
his "<i>cher</i>," and "<i>combien je regrette</i>," and his bow that
passed to the lady with a deep inclination of respectful reproach, they
all took their leave. They had scarcely disappeared when I turned to
speak to her again. But that was not her humour. Solemnly rising
opposite me, she drew her heels together and bowed to me as if she had
a hinge in her back with such an exact imitation of the German
captain's salute that I could not help laughing. She laughed
too&mdash;merrily, like a child.</p>

<p>"What strange people," she cried. "What strange people. Did you ever
see such marionettes? "</p>

<p>"They are a little stiff," I admitted, "but you were going to tell
me why you don't like Englishmen."</p>

<p>"I don't know any Englishmen," she said, looking at me with frank
directness, "and from what I have read about them, I'm afraid I should
not like them. I'm afraid not," she repeated decisively.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked; and while she set to work to answer me,
I took the opportunity of looking at her in order to make up my mind
whether she was really good-looking or not. Iknew already&mdash;her
walk and movements showed&mdash;that she had a good figure; but her
complexion was tallowy, as if she had lived much in close rooms, and it
took more than one glance to see that her features were good. Perhaps
the oval of the face was too round for beauty&mdash;the forehead was
certainly too broad&mdash;but the eyes were really fine, a clear hazel
flecked with gold, which doesn't at all explain the impression they
gave of transparent sincerity and courage. Her <i>staccato</i> manner
of speaking with long pauses between each sentence became more marked,
I noticed, when the subject matter interested her.</p>

<p>"The French&mdash;we know what they are," she began. "Nothing will
ever alter them. The Germans, too, we know; they are all like
that,"&mdash;with a gesture that seemed to people again the empty room.
"But the English are hard to know well. They have done great things in
the past&mdash;brought political liberty into life and built up a great
empire; but one feels as if their work were finished. Don't you know
what I mean? A selfish individualism is the soul of them&mdash;the
characteristic&mdash;and that is not what we want to-day."</p>

<p>I was more than interested, I was much astonished and half annoyed
at her frank if somewhat doctrinaire criticism.</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly what you mean," I replied. "What do you find
us lacking in? We don't seem yet to have failed in the world," I added,
with more composure, feeling that at last I had got on safe ground.</p>

<p>"That's just it," she retorted quickly, layingher hand on the table,
"you are successful, and therefore satisfied, as if material success
and contentment were not a proof of spiritual failure."</p>

<p>"Now I'm afraid you have got beyond me," I replied, and, half to
cover my pique, I forced a smile, "unless, indeed, you will mention a
nation that has failed materially and yet been a spiritual
success."</p>

<p>"Athens," she cried, with a look of astonishment. (Her eyes were
magnificent.) "And Judea&mdash;they both speak to the soul and are more
interesting to humanity than Rome, for instance, with its insensate
pride and lust of domination."</p>

<p>I was silenced, if not convinced. No satisfactory reply suggesting
itself at the moment, I tried to make our talk lighter, more personal,
by asking:</p>

<p>"And what countrywoman are you?"</p>

<p>"Guess," she threw out with a smile.</p>

<p>"I am at a loss," I replied hesitatingly. "You are dark, and might
be a Spaniard from the <i>mantilla</i>. But you have no accent in
French and none in German that I can distinguish. I am puzzled."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," she said, "I have an accent in German&mdash;a
strong accent. I am a Russian."</p>

<p>"A Russian. Strange! I'm going to Russia soon." Her look of interest
exciting me, I went on: "A teacher at Oxford put the idea into my head;
an odd mixture, he is, of art-critic and socialist."</p>

<p>"What is his name?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, you would scarcely have heard of him,and yet he's interesting;
his name's Ruskin; a sort of professor at Oxford, and a wonderful
writer."</p>

<p>"So," she said, "he has sympathies with the poor, has he?"</p>

<p>"The deepest sympathy; he gave nearly all his fortune away to them
and preached a sort of new crusade in their favour."</p>

<p>"An Englishman?" she asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," I replied warmly. "There's nothing strange in that,
surely. Everyone must admit that we have done more for the poor than
any other nation."</p>

<p>"We knew you had more to do," she replied, and then after a long
pause, she added, "but not that you had done more."</p>

<p>"I wish you knew Ruskin," I went on, feeling that his fine
personality gave me the best chance of interesting her. "He is all
enthusiasm and unselfishness&mdash;a remarkable man. He had a great
influence at Oxford and did a lot of good."</p>

<p>"And now you are coming to Russia?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that was a sort of farewell dinner I was giving."</p>

<p>"Then you are coming at once?"</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened and a young man entered the room. The
girl presented him simply&mdash;"My brother;" we bowed and shook hands.
One thing was sure; he was utterly unlike his sister. She was tall and
graceful, whereas he was below the average height and very slight. A
little, thin, nervous apparition with the tiniest hands, and dressed
with excessive care like a French dandy.</p>

<p>His sister went on, "This gentleman is thinking of coming to Russia
to learn Russian and he is interested in social questions. We are too,
are we not, Andr&eacute;?" and she put her arm caressingly on the young
man's shoulder.</p>

<p>"You are," he said smiling; the glance was sympathetic and made me
like him.</p>

<p>I don't know why, but the entrance of this new person on the scene
seemed to remove the girl from me, and I was surprised to find
resentment in me at the discovery. I determined to do my best to keep
up the acquaintance.</p>

<p>"I was telling your sister," I began, "that I was just leaving
Munich to go to Russia. I hope we may meet there."</p>

<p>"But if you are going soon," she said, "why not go with us? We are
leaving for Vienna this evening by the express."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the young man, nodding in answer to my look of inquiry,
"why not come with us?"</p>

<p>"But you have probably a father or a mother who might object to my
intrusion."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," the girl broke in, "my mother is resting upstairs, but I
am sure that she would be glad if you would come with us. And then we
might learn more about Ruskin and his socialistic ideas."</p>

<p>"Are you sure she wouldn't object?" I insisted.</p>

<p>"Of course, I'm sure; but I will write and ask her and show you what
she says. Then you will know." She turned to the table and drew the
writing materials towards her.</p>

<p>"You see," the brother said, smiling to me, "everyone does what
Sonia wants. She always has her own way, and it is generally a good
way."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the girl turned round blushing vividly and looking
wonderfully pretty. "Now, Andrushka, you are praising me and that's not
allowed. Besides, if you talk about me how can I write my letter? I
must listen;" and she laughed at the implied confession.</p>

<p>A moment later she had rung the bell and given the note to the
waiter.</p>

<p>"Now tell me of your Ruskin," she said, turning round in her chair.
"He interests me. He must be like a man I knew in Petersburg, who had a
great influence on me, Michailoff. He was a great man in some ways, a
great intelligence, but he was not good."</p>

<p>"Ah," I said, "Ruskin is good. That's perhaps the secret of his
power." Somehow or other, I felt that I was carrying my audience with
me in my enthusiasm and the impulse to continue overcame me. "His
belief comes from the heart and he is not afraid to speak to the
heart." (She nodded with quick approval.) "In one of his lectures at
Oxford&mdash;a lecture to a thousand, irreverent
under-graduates&mdash;I remember he paused in the middle of something
he was saying and turned upon us with the words, 'We should all be
frequent in breaking bread with the poor.' The effect was
extraordinary; one felt that Jesus must have spoken like that.</p>

<p>"It was he who put the idea into my head of studying social
questions on the Continent; hethought that the student, like the
apprentice, should have his <i>Wanderjahre</i>."</p>

<p>At this moment the German waiter came in and handed the girl a note.
After one glance at it she handed it to me. It was from her mother and
this is how it began: "Je serai charm&eacute;e de faire la connaissance
d'un Anglais; ils sont si comme-il-faut. Ton ami sera le bienvenu. . .
."</p>

<p>"You see," said Sonia quietly, "my mother has answered as I knew she
would. Now you will come, won't you?"</p>

<p>"I can hardly come to-night," I replied. "I have to pack and some
friends to see; but I will follow. If you will tell me the hotel you
are going to in Vienna, I will follow you&mdash;in forty-eight hours at
most."</p>

<p>At this they both rose: the brother seemed too nervous to sit still
for any length of time.</p>

<p>"Your Ruskin interests me," the girl said quietly, "and you interest
me more, for you may act while he has only talked or written." (She
spoke without a trace of coquetry.) "I shall be glad to see you in
Vienna. I am glad already that I did not obey my first impulse and run
away when I looked through the door and saw you all sitting there like
automatons, so stiff and prim," and she laughed again at the
recollection.</p>

<p>"Did you really feel shy?" I asked. "You seemed perfectly
composed."</p>

<p>"I'm glad," she replied; "shyness is childish. One has to conquer
those impulses, don't you think?"</p>

<p>Since I had talked of Ruskin, her manner hadgrown quite friendly,
and the change pleased me.</p>

<p>At this moment her brother opened the door, and she passed out of
the room with the words, "The Ring Hotel, Wednesday afternoon," on her
lips. I stood looking after her, feeling as if some of the brightness
had gone out of the air and the warmth. . . .</p>

<p>Until that day I had never thought myself very impressionable, but I
was now to learn the extraordinary influence a girl could exercise on
me after a single meeting. At first I seemed to feel nothing but
surprise at her intelligence. We had only talked for a short time and
yet she had astonished me; was "material success" really " a proof of
spiritual failure?" as she had said. I could not believe that; it
seemed a paradox to me, and yet a paradox full of disquieting
possibilities. She had evidently peculiar standards. The talk about
Ruskin had touched her emotions; was he her ideal? Hardly. Almost her
last words showed that she preferred men of action to writers or
speakers. And then my thought passed to her confession that when she
first looked into the room she had felt too shy to enter it, and I
dwelt on that; it seemed to bring her closer to me. Her manner, too,
had been wholly womanly and sympathetic when she told me she would be
glad to see me in Vienna. I kept recalling this and her delicious
shyness, and her vivid blushing under her brother's praise. In spite of
her intellect, she was a woman&mdash;charming. I wanted to see her
again; I would go to the train to see them off, I thought. No,that
would appear too marked an attention. I mustn't make a fool of myself;
I didn't know who she was, nor her name even. But I should like to know
what she meant exactly, when she said that I might act; as if deeds
were more than any speech or book. . What sort of action did she mean?
. . .</p>

<p>I went out for my usual walk in the afternoon, but I walked as one
in a dream. I could not help recalling her words, her rare gestures,
her looks&mdash;every glance had meaning in it. By the way, what a
funny trick of speaking she had; nervously abrupt and quick, with long
pauses. Was that like her shyness, an impulse held in rein by reason?
And why was shyness so wonderful and charming in her? In was common
enough in other girls and in them rather uninteresting. The whole charm
lay, of course, in the magic of her personality. She might be anyone, I
felt, or do anything. I could not quite understand her, and that
excited me. . . .</p>

<p>Why should I not go to the train? She had been perfectly frank with
me; why should I not be as ingenuous with her? I wanted to go; that was
certain. I wanted to see her again; to feel the cool, firm hand, and
win from her, if possible, another expression of interest in me. Yes,
that was it. I desired this girl's interest and her praise more than I
ever desired praise from anybody in my life. I felt that what she said
would be absolutely sincere. That was not love, I said to myself; it
was the effect her nature made on mine. In reality I wanted praise. I,
go to the station. It was silly not to go. I, meet them on theplatform
with some flowers&mdash;one bunch for the mother and one for the girl.
That would make it look all right. I, hurry back and get the flowers. .
. .</p>

<p>I was on the platform waiting for them before the train was made up.
I had a Dienstmann with me carrying my bouquets, and had already paid
him and given him most definite instructions to make himself scarce,
the moment I took the flowers from him, when suddenly I saw them coming
towards me. They were almost the first arrivals, and walking towards
them I thought, "we shall have quite ten minutes together." The mother
was being wheeled along in a chair, and the daughter was walking by her
side. The old lady was very stout and seemed almost incapable of
moving, but her eyes were bright and intelligent&mdash;hazel too,
though far smaller than her daughter's; and as soon as the daughter
presented me with, "This is the gentleman, mother," she told me in very
perfect French that she was glad to see me and still more glad to think
that I should meet them in Vienna and go with them to their place near
Petersburg.</p>

<p>"I am a great invalid," she went on, "but Sonia and Andr&eacute;
will keep you company, and if you want to learn Russian, it is
certainly dull enough at &mdash;&mdash; to learn anything."</p>

<p>Of course I thanked her and said how sorry I was to see that she was
not strong, but she interrupted me briskly:</p>

<p>"Oh, I am strong, quite strong; it is my body that is weak, and
above all lazy&mdash;very lazy," and she laughed.</p>

<p>"Mother says that," said Sonia, "but she is indeed ailing. You know
you were very ill in Paris, mother."</p>

<p>"Ah, dear Paris," repeated the old lady, with a sigh, "how I love
it, with its frivolity and gaiety. It is all so pleasant to me. There
seems to be no winter there, and in Russia it is all winter and
solitude, and I hate it."</p>

<p>"You see," said the girl gravely, "mother is scarcely a Russian. She
speaks very little Russian; she lived nearly all her youth in Paris;
her father was in the Embassy there. I often say she is not a Russian
or she could not speak of Russia as she does."</p>

<p>"Of course," retorted the mother with a comical little smile,
"children nowadays know more than their parents. But I must be getting
into the train. I am very heavy and almost helpless."</p>

<p>In a few minutes we had got her into the carriage and settled her
among books and wraps, and then for the first time I remembered my
flowers and handed her a bouquet, which brought forth voluble thanks.
She loved flowers, she said; it was so kind of me to think of them; an
old woman was not used to such attentions, and so forth.</p>

<p>My opportunity had come. Turning to the girl, I gave her the other
bouquet, and in a voice which I made as matter of course as possible,
asked her to walk up the platform with me. With rare opportuneness, the
brother had gone off to get papers, and without a word Sonia turned
from the carriage and I was alone with her. I hardly knew how to
begin.</p>

<p>"You love Russia," I said, still under the impression of the feeling
with which she had spoken. She turned to me and nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I love it," she said. "I love it with all my heart and soul."
After a pause she went on, "our peasants call it 'Holy Russia,' you
know, and to us it is even more than that. The other European nations
are uninteresting. What they have done, they will do again; their
course is traced; the orbit known. Their future will be as common as
their past. But everything is possible to Russia. If humanity is ever
to do or be anything great, if men are ever to rise to the
possibilities in them and live noble lives, it must be in Russia. She
is the last of the European nations to enter into her birthright. How
can one help loving her, 'Holy Russia!'"</p>

<p>She spoke with extraordinary passion; but what she said was too
reasoned and decided, I thought; it seemed to put a great distance
between us; I hardly knew how to answer her. The conversation went
lamely afterwards, and in a minute or so the bell rang. As she entered
the carriage, she said:</p>

<p>"I shall be looking for you on Wednesday afternoon. You are
sympathetic."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was her foreign phrase that made me act like a foreigner;
I bowed my head to her and kissed her hand, and the next moment she was
in the train and had taken her seat. I remember shaking hands with her
brother; but she did not come to the window, and I went away from the
station with a vision in my mind of her firstappearance as I saw her
walking by the side of her mother's chair, tall and graceful.</p>

<p>When I thought over this meeting I was disappointed; nothing new had
come to me from her. The truth probably was that I had already been
moved so intensely in the afternoon that my feelings were incapable of
receiving another new an profound impression of the same sort in the
evening. But still her strength of character and passionate enthusiasm
were clearer to me than they had been. Her soul appeared to me like a
flame of extraordinary steadiness and height. An astonishing girl, I
said to myself, most astonishing!</p>

<p>As my stay in Munich drew to an end I began to dwell more and more
on the womanly and charming side of her character, and especially on
the interest she seemed to take in me; and so I cultivated, I suppose,
the growth of a similar feeling in myself. All through life we are
merely children, and turn naturally to what is sweet to us; but my
longing for the pleasant fruit was checked by a sort of natural
caution. I could see that my new friends were people of some
importance, but I resolved to find out much more about them before I
committed myself definitely, and thus I lulled my inborn prudence to
rest.</p>

<p>On the Wednesday morning, when I got into the train, I could not
help noticing that my usual indifference had deserted me. I was so
unnaturally eager that every now and again I had to laugh at my own
impatience. I took no interest in what went on about me; in imagination
I was alreadyat the goal, standing before her, looking into her eyes,
touching her hands. And so I lived in my dream-paradise, shutting out
as far as I could the banalities of the railway journey. As soon as I
had unpacked my luggage and made myself decent, I got the waiter to
take me to their sitting-room. In a moment Sonia was before me, holding
out both hands to me. I took them in some surprise; the mute appeal was
so intense; but her first words explained everything.</p>

<p>"He is so ill," she cried. "Andrushka. I was afraid; but now you
have come, it will all be right," and she sighed with relief.</p>

<p>"Ill!" I repeated. "Sit down and tell me about it. What is the
matter? When did it begin?"</p>

<p>"He must have caught cold," she replied. "You know he has always
been very delicate, and he won't take care of himself. We reached
Vienna very early on Tuesday morning; it was cold, and he must have
caught a chill, for in the afternoon he complained of headache and
pains in his limbs, so I put him to bed and sent for a doctor. But the
fever has increased; his temperature rose all through the night, and
though it is supposed to go down a little in the morning, it has not
gone down but gone up, ever since the beginning, and the doctor looks
very grave."</p>

<p>Tears came into her eyes. I wanted to take her in my arms and
console her, and the impulse was so strong that I rose to my feet in
order by brusque movement to throw it off.</p>

<p>"What does the doctor call it?" I asked."Dangerous fevers don't come
like that in a day from any ordinary chill."</p>

<p>"You will see the doctor," she replied. "He will be back in an hour
or so, and you must ask him. But since you have come I am less
anxious."</p>

<p>She spoke like a child, a tired child, and as I took in the
weariness of her face, I said:</p>

<p>"You have been up all night. You have not changed your clothes, I am
sure. Now go away at once and change. Then you must come back and have
some tea."</p>

<p>She nodded her head again like a child and smiled faintly as she
passed into the room on the other side of the sitting-room. In half an
hour she was back again looking far brighter and better. We had tea
together, and I for one enjoyed it. Then began for us a perpetual
interchange of emotions, a partnership of hopes and fears which
gradually drew us closer and closer in sympathy and mutual
comprehension.</p>

<p>I saw at once that her love for her brother had made her excessively
anxious about him; the quickness of her intelligence acting on her
ignorance of disease had frightened her so that she dreaded the worst
before there was any cause for anxiety. Of course, I set myself to
combat her fears and give her confidence, and I got the German doctor
to help me. At first he wanted to make out that the case was serious.
All doctors do this, I think; it exalts ones's opinion of their skill
if the patient recovers, and if he chance to die&mdash;well, the doctor
is safe, for at the very beginning he said it was serious. But pushed
into a corner, the doctor had toadmit that dangerous fevers are
generally of long inception; and that young Andr&eacute; was probably
suffering from nothing but a feverish attack which would pass off
almost as quickly as it had come. I was more than repaid for all my
efforts when Sonia said to me after the doctor had left:</p>

<p>"What courage you give me! what confidence!"</p>

<p>I tried to persuade her to go to bed and let me sit up in her stead,
but this she would not hear of. Nor could I persuade her to dine with
me. She felt quite strong, she said, after the tea, and did not want
anything more. All I could do was to order a cup of
<i>consomm&eacute;</i> to be left in the room and make her promise to
take it during the night, and then she insisted on my going. I was not
to stay in the sitting-room; I was not to return after my dinner; she
felt she ought not to leave her brother or to see me again that
evening. No, it must be good-bye till to-morrow morning, and all I
could do was to repeat, "Good-night, good-night, Sonia," and take my
leave.</p>

<p>I went to the dining-room rather pleased with myself. I felt that I
had made considerable progress; I had called her "Sonia" without
rebuff. I saw that she liked me, too; and altogether I was pretty
confident. In this hopeful mind I made a good dinner, went to bed, and
slept like a top.</p>

<p>In the morning I called upon her only to find her even more anxious
than she had been the day before. The patient had scarcely slept at
all; his temperature was still going up; the pulse rapid and fitful. In
spite of her attempts atself-control, Sonia was evidently very nervous,
and I had harder work to arouse her courage this time because she was
tired out with another night's watching and sleeplessness. I could not
persuade her to go to rest or let me take her place. It was enough for
her, she said, that I was in the hotel. It did her good. But she would
not hear of me as a nurse; that was her business.</p>

<p>"But," I said, "you are wearing yourself out. You are suffering
already; you will make yourself ill if you go on like this."</p>

<p>"Think of what he is suffering," she said in a pitiful little
whisper, and turned to go to him again. I tried to keep her in the
room, and when I saw that was impossible, tried to make her promise to
see me again in an hour, but she wouldn't. I could come back in the
afternoon, she said, or better still in the evening at seven o'clock,
when the doctor was to come, and then she would see me. She seemed to
take a positive pleasure in her own weariness and discomfort, as if her
suffering could diminish her brother's.</p>

<p>I went out, walked about, and bought some necessaries, and thus wore
through a gloomy and stupid day. I had begun to blame myself for always
giving in to Sonia; the man, it seemed to me, should make his will
dominant, whereas I was continually doing what she wished. Then I
remembered what her brother had said, that everyone did what Sonia
wished, and that usually her way was the best way, and with this
thought I tried to appease my vanity. But a spirit of revolt was in me,
a resolve to have my way a little, and so in the evening Iwaylaid the
doctor in the porch of the hotel and persuaded him to take my side and
insist on Sonia's going to bed. A compliment or two made him willing to
do all I wanted. She was very nervous and over-sensitive, he said, and
the brother had no constitution and seemed to have wasted the greater
part of the little vital energy he was born with. "The girl is strong
and healthy," was his conclusion, "but the boy is a poor creature."</p>

<p>After he had been in the bedroom a few minutes, I went into the
sitting-room and waited for them, and when they came in together, I
attacked at once. But in spite of the doctor's assistance I should not
have carried my point if I had not shown Sonia that the only way to sit
up on Saturday night and on Sunday night was to go to bed on Friday
night. Then she consented, on my promising to wake her up if any change
took place in the patient's condition; but before she would go to her
room she gave me a multitude of minute directions. At length I was left
alone with the patient. He did not seem to know me, but that was not
very wonderful, as his temperature was about 104. If it went up a point
higher I was to give him a little weak brandy and water, otherwise
nothing but milk and soda, and I was to take his temperature every two
hours.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock I found his temperature nearly 105. I gave him some
brandy and water. Holding his pulse, I soon noticed that the stimulant
had done him good; it was strength he needed; I repeated the dose again
and again. At twelve o'clock his temperature was 103, and as I
turnedfrom him I saw that Sonia had come to the bedside. I immediately
led her away into the sitting-room; told her of the fortunate turn the
fever had taken, and insisted upon her going to bed. But it needed no
insistence; she was quite reasonable now.</p>

<p>"I am so glad," she said over and over again, and almost immediately
afterwards, "Do you know, I am very tired and thirsty. Might I have
something to drink?"</p>

<p>I poured her out some soda and milk, and had the satisfaction of
hearing her promise that she would go to bed at once. After that I
closed her own door on her and went again to her brother's bed-side. It
was all plain sailing afterwards. The patient's temperature gradually
diminished, until at six o'clock it was barely 101, or less than it had
been on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>I had the chart in my hand and was studying it in the half-light of
the curtain-shaded room, when I suddenly felt a hand on my shoulder and
the next moment Sonia put her finger on the chart with a little gleeful
whisper:</p>

<p>"Then it was true! I'm so glad. He's much better, isn't he?" and as
I replied very confidently, "He is all right, I think," she took my
head in both her hands and kissed me twice on the forehead.</p>

<p>"You have cured him," she said. "I knew you would; you are all
health, one with nature and life&mdash;not overwrought or tortured, I
mean, like we are. And I, of course, I kept awake for days, and then at
the crisis overslept myself."</p>

<p>She looked so dainty fresh as she spoke that Itried to take her in
my arms, but she drew herself away from me at once with a finger on her
lips and a glance at the bed, so that I could only smile my entire
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Come out," she said, "and tell me all about it," and in the
sitting-room I told her of the happy change.</p>

<p>All she said was, "You cured him. I felt sure you would from the
first, you healer!" When I tried to give the doctor the credit, she
would not have it; she merely shook her head imperiously and said, "I
know, I know." And in this state the doctor found us.</p>

<p>After a short examination of the patient he confirmed us in the
belief that the crisis was over and that there was no longer any
danger. In fact he declared that as the day was going to be warm the
windows of the sick-room could be opened and the patient might take a
little <i>bouillon</i>. He had brought a nurse with him, too, and
insisted that she should take Sonia's place at the bedside.</p>

<p>"But what shall I do?" asked Sonia, in a dismal way that made us
both laugh.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I think you had better go for a drive and have a
pleasant day after all your anxieties."</p>

<p>I could have hugged him for the suggestion, which I took care,
however, to receive in as matter of course a way as possible. When I
said that I would come back at eleven with a carriage, the doctor
backed me up valiantly as one who knew that he was pleasing his clients
by his determined attitude.</p>

<p>"I will answer for the patient," he said; "you go and enjoy
yourselves."</p>

<p>"But first I must tell mother," said Sonia; and she hurried off.</p>

<p>After my tub and breakfast I felt completely refreshed, so spent my
time in hunting up the best droshky I could find; and punctually at
eleven I called for Sonia. She had only to put her hat on, she said,
but first I must come in and see how much better Andr&eacute; was. I
found a marvellous change in him. His face was peaky and white, of
course, and his hands thin to transparency, but he looked something
like his old self and had developed, the nurse said, a remarkable
appetite. He was almost too weak to speak, but he smiled at us and
seemed quite comfortable.</p>

<p>Shall I ever forget that drive, I wonder. We went down the Ring,
through the crowds and past the shops, and then out along the Prater.
The air was like champagne. In spite of the sun's warmth it was cool
under the trees, with the Danube water gleaming through the leaves on
our left. Everything was gay and bright in the summer sunshine, and
Sonia chattered away with the absolute unconsciousness of a happy
child. What she said I don't know, and I would not reproduce it if I
could. It was all so light and unimportant and happy, just the natural
rebound of her spirit from the depression and anxiety of the last few
days.</p>

<p>Suddenly she said she was hungry, and I asked her which was the best
place to get something to eat. She called out the name of a restaurant
tothe driver, who at once turned towards the city. The restaurant stood
on one of the corners of the Ringstrasse, but Sonia insisted on the
driver going to the side-entrance.</p>

<p>"The private rooms are there," she explained, and we don't want to
go into a public room to-day, do we?"</p>

<p>Of course, I agreed with her, but a little chill came over me. Had
she gone to a private room before, I wondered? With some other man,
perhaps? The gaiety and intoxication seemed to have gone out of the
air. As I followed her up the red carpeted stairs, I was plunged back
into my old self and became a little more critical even than usual.</p>

<p>But Sonia would not have it, and sulkiness was impossible in her
company. The lunch was to be the most wonderful lunch that was ever
ordered; I must choose it all; but she was very hungry and it must come
quick. And wasn't the bread in Vienna the best I had ever eaten, and
wasn't it a glorious day, and splendid to be together, till at last I,
too, entered into her mood and talked and laughed without knowing
why.</p>

<p>The lunch was not half over however when Sonia declared she must
hurry and get back. In vain I remonstrated with her. I told her that in
Vienna the coffee was even better than the bread and that I wanted
some, but she would not listen to me. She must go back. If I wanted to,
I could stay and drink my old coffee; she'd go home by herself. Before
I knew what I was doing she had whisked me downstairs and into the
droshky.</p>

<p>At the staircase of the hotel she left me, telling me that she would
be back in a quarter of an hour; and she was back in that time.
Andr&eacute;, it appeared, was really much better; his mother was
sitting with him and we were free to go wherever we liked. So off we
went, side by side, into the solitude of the crowded streets.</p>

<p>From this day our true companionship began, an intimacy of every
hour, which lasted for weeks and weeks and makes it impossible for me
to attempt to chronicle any single day's doings. I remember nearly
every hour of it, though I must resolve now not to tell everything I
remember; but simply the deepest impressions made upon me, whatever was
at once novel and enduring in our intercourse.</p>

<p>One morning, for instance, was spent in the Belvedere Gallery; Sonia
wanted to show me this, that, and the other picture. I soon found she
was a most interesting guide. She did not judge like any one else whom
I had ever seen. She evidently knew something about painting and loved
colours for their own sake; but her judgment was always of the spirit.
I do not mean by that that she judged pictures from the literary point
of view&mdash;by the story they told; she seemed to judge them by the
soul in them, the amount of emotion they contained; and she was often
quite curiously right, I thought. In this way and that the days passed,
and for some time I was content to feel that our intimacy was growing
happier, the lighter side of her nature was charming to me.</p>

<p>What surprised me most in her was that she didnot at once lose that
frank gaiety of spirit I had noticed in her for the first time on the
morning after her brother's recovery. Again and again she forced me to
laughter by her quaint imitations of the faces and gestures we saw in
street and cafe. Everything that was unreal or artificial struck her
humour, and she was continually taking off the endless affectations of
the Germans, the pompousness of the men and the trivialities of the
women, with a power of mimicry that would have made her fortune on the
stage. But though the humour was light and joyous, one felt every now
and then piercing through it the contempt of a sincerer race, or at
least of a race with a surer instinct and understanding of the art of
living.</p>

<p>"The Germans," she said once, "are like their language, large, but
ill-formed and awkward; disciplined mediocrities they all seem to me,
and their women, hens, 'Cluck, cluck, cluck, kaff&eacute;e klatsch!'"
and her laughter had contempt and dislike in it. And just as I noticed
a seriousness behind her mimicry so I soon felt a deep melancholy
underlying her almost feverish gaiety. Sometimes she would brood for
hours without speaking, till I roused her, in fact, and sometimes she
would grow bitterly indignant at some little snobbism that seemed to me
perfectly harmless. She was a <i>revolt&eacute;e</i>, I told myself;
but the changes in her of temper and nature fascinated me and day by
day her beauty grew upon me; for I now saw that she was beautiful or
more than beautiful. The slim grace of her figure was as the swaying of
a lily-stem in water and her eager face with thesoulful eyes and
sensitive mouth was infinitely seductive.</p>

<p>From hour to hour passion grew in me till I lost count of all she
did or said that did not feed my desire, and at last I spoke. We had
spent the morning, I remember, with her brother and mother, and in the
afternoon while they went shopping together, she and I drove out as by
mutual consent along the river. She was in a strange mood; now she
would rally me on my silence, and when I spoke, would herself begin to
brood. We left the carriage at my impulse to avoid the coachman, and as
we walked together in perfect solitude among the trees I tried to
speak; but my mouth was parched as with fever. I stood still, and the
scene rises again before me as I write. There within reach of me the
slight figure, etched against the coppery reds and golds and greens of
sunset. On this side of the sky, tones of turquoise and sapphire
blended with the iris of mother of pearl, and on that side,
cloud-castles of fantastic architecture shot through by jets of flame
glowed and faded in a final conflagration. I could not speak; I
stretched out my arms and drew her to me, and turned her face up to
mine and kissed her as if I would never part from her again. I was
surprised at my own passion; for a moment or two she was wholly mine.
As she moved away from me I asked her hungrily:</p>

<p>"Do you love me, Sonia? You know I love you."</p>

<p>Her eyes dwelt on mine with pitying tenderness; but in a moment she
regained self-mastery:</p>

<p>"Yes; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?" I exclaimed. "What do you mean? What can separate us if
we love each other. Every time you give me a little of yourself, you
take it back next time we meet. Why?"</p>

<p>"Don't say that," she cried appealingly, "I would give you anything,
everything, gladly, if I were free."</p>

<p>"But you are free," I cried hotly. "You told me that you cared for
no one else and are engaged to no one."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "don't let us talk and spoil the golden hours. Love
me if you can and I will love you as I can. For a little while we are
together, and the past is far away and affection's sweet," and she laid
her hand on my arm and gave herself to me in a look. I didn't
understand her; but I drew her to me and kissed her mouth. The slim
body fluttered in my hands as a bird flutters, and then was still; but
as she felt me against her I saw the vivid flush rise in her cheeks and
she began to draw herself away from me, slowly but irresistibly. I was
conscious of the determination in her and let her go; for something
told me that time was on my side and that the sweetness of our caresses
would grow on her and not diminish. In silence we walked together and
soon she took my hand and put it to her cheek, and we went on hand in
hand like children, while my heart leaped in gladness and I could have
thanked God for the winning of my imperious delight.</p>

<p>But my hopes fell very low in the days that followed. Again and
again my passionateexclamation came back to me as the exact
truth&mdash;whenever she gave me a little of herself, she seemed to
take it back the next time we met. I had perpetually to reconquer her,
and this intensified my desire and exasperated my nerves, till at times
I was little better than an animal. Scarcely ever did she yield enough
to call forth in me that divine tenderness which is the seventh heaven
of passion.</p>

<p>It was about this time that she began to ask me about myself and my
plans for my future life. Naturally I told her everything. I described
the old days in the Union at Oxford, and said that I wanted to enter
Parliament, hoping to do some little good. Somehow or other the more
enthusiastically I talked, the colder she seemed to become. I could not
account for it; and yet&mdash;God help me!&mdash;I tried to win her by
exaggerating sympathies which were not the deepest in me. I told her of
what had been done for the poor in England; I described the working of
the Factory Acts and the Poorhouses, and pointed out that more would
have to be done; that pensions for the aged poor would be established
by the State and all taxes on necessaries would be abolished, while the
taxes on luxuries would be greatly increased. It was all no good. She
listened with a curious interest which was a part of her intellectual
being, but behind the mask of sympathetic manner I felt a barrier of
resolute indifference I could not explain or account for.</p>

<p>As the days went on and the date of our departure came nearer, she
seemed to grow colder, more detached; she certainly yielded herself
lessto me. What was the mysterious influence that was drawing her from
me?&mdash;I asked myself in vain. Again and again I tried to win her;
but her resolution stood firm. Now and then she'd let herself go to
love for a moment; but the next moment she'd draw back. I was really
half glad when our stay came to an end. Andr&eacute; was completely
cured, and his mother wished to spend the full summer in her country
house. Just before starting, my exasperated nerves gave way, and I
reproached Sonia with her coldness, and told her that her reserve was
drawing out the worst in me and not the best. As soon as I said that,
she put her hand on my mouth and looked at me with such a passion of
deprecation and regret, that I choked my thoughts to silence. In vain I
cudgelled my brains for some explanation of her conduct; I could find
none. It was really enough to drive one mad, the continual vain groping
to understand the enigma; and yet the clue was to be given me sooner
than I dared to hope.</p>

<p>We had resolved to go over Warsaw to Petersburg; for their
country-house &mdash;&mdash; was only about thirty miles up the Neva
from the capital. If I would, I could not describe the long journey
from Vienna to Warsaw. I was chiefly occupied in amusing the mother and
daughter and attending to their comforts, hoping vaguely in some way or
other to make myself pleasant to them through companionship. The wish
to ingratiate myself, which seemed to me a degradation and to some
extent an abdication of my manhood, had come to me from that last
fortnight in Vienna, in which thefear of losing my love had grown upon
me like a nightmare. The journey was pleasant enough. Andr&eacute; and
his mother were interested in every detail, and that gave rest to Sonia
and myself. We spent a night in Warsaw, in a huge ill-furnished hotel,
and the next day we were off again over the boundless bare plains that
seemed to me so depressing. In the afternoon I remember we crossed the
true Russian frontier at &mdash;&mdash; I forget the name of the
station. As soon as we started again, I found on entering the train
that Sofia had lowered the double windows in one part of the corridor
and was leaning out. I walked up to her and half-timidly put my hand on
her shoulder. She did not draw away; for a moment or two she did not
even seem to notice it, and then she turned to me with tears shining in
her eyes and her whole face quivering.</p>

<p>"Russia," she said, "our Russia! Don't you love it? I love every bit
of it. You said a little while ago in Poland that the boundless plains
were monotonous. My God, how could you have said that? There is the
great earth, naked and fruitful where men labour, where they are born
and live and die, and over them the heavens arched. 'Ugly,' you said.
These plains ugly! And you talked of the need of wood and hill to make
a scene beautiful, just like a landscape gardener. Ah, if it is ugly, I
love its ugliness. Here at any rate one can take long breaths
uncontaminated and feel oneself alone. I return to nature as to a
mother when I get back to Russia, and feel myself at one with the earth
and air and sky."</p>

<p>"But won't you think of England, Sonia?" I said, "and our lives
there."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she answered imperiously, "there it is again, England,
England. But what can we do in England, I ask you? You told me that
there were dozens of men from her universities, just like
you&mdash;well-born, well-taught and far too well-dressed," and she put
her hand on me deprecatingly, "eager to enter Parliament, to extend the
already overgrown British Empire and to debase poverty with the
cast-off clothes and broken meats of waste. England is finished, I tell
you," and she sprang upright, "she is hidebound in her traditions and
her past, and her conventions choke her; but here we have to make
traditions. Think of that. We are not bound in any way; we are only
asked to make our lives memorable. Ah! there is a thirst in me for
great deeds. I hate your ordinary commonplace life. There! it is said."
And she began to move up and down like a caged wild thing, heedless of
the people in the other compartments who stared out at her. In a moment
or two she stopped by me again:</p>

<p>"Will no man be born like Russia, worthy of her?" and she put her
hands on my shoulders and her passion swept her away.</p>

<p>"Don't you see how we want a man?" she cried. "Every nation wants
one. Look at that accursed German emperor! Because the French stole
Alsace from Germany, when he took it back again, he stole Lorraine with
it. Lorraine, the country of Jeanne d'Arc! Lorraine that is all French,
that is as much French as Berlin is German! The ignoblethief! And now
he might give it back and give peace to the world as well and establish
right as a sacred thing, and he is content to drill and dress and feed
and sleep. Will no one kill the dog and make place for a better
man?"</p>

<p>Her reckless violence shocked me. "His successor would be no
better," I said, "probably worse."</p>

<p>"Not so," she said, with eager pointing hand, "were his father swept
away terribly the son might listen to his conscience. The one great
fact would bring him nearer to all other facts. . . . Ah, to think of
it. Any one of those Hohenzollerns by giving back Lorraine to France
might win immortal reputation by a single generous act. There are two
crowns before each of them&mdash;the heavy, hard gold symbol, and the
exquisite circlet forged of peace and love and the gratitude of
humanity. And they all choose the metal crown and strut through bowing
apes and stand in God's sunshine without fear."</p>

<p>She seemed no longer conscious of my existence. Her speech was like
a storm torn by flashes of hate and sarcasm.</p>

<p>"And here in Russia it is worse. We have a nincompoop as
Tsar&mdash;an Alexander," she said bitterly, "when we want a great man.
Was there ever such irony? The people ask him for liberty, for a patch
of land, for ordered peaceful life-space for their souls to breathe
in&mdash;and he sits on their necks choking them. And our people are so
kind, so patient, so long-suffering. 'A good man!' they call him, it
maddens me to hearthem. Will no one free us from the lies and liars?
"</p>

<p>"Ah," I said, "you are kicking against the pricks. Every fine nature
does that."</p>

<p>"And gets tired of doing it too, eh?" she said, sinking down into
her seat wearily and staring again out of the window.</p>

<p>I did not know what to say. Her recklessness had surprised me,
shocked me, too, a little. I moved to her and put my hand again on her
shoulder. She sighed restlessly, but did not move, and so we stood for
a long time together, till I went back to the others and left her still
sitting there.</p>

<p>An hour or so afterwards Andr&eacute; looked out of the door and saw
her, and turned again to his ordinary chatter with a shrug of the
shoulders:</p>

<p>"Sonia is in one of her moods. To be severely left alone is the only
cure."</p>

<p>But I could not take this philosophic view. I was still shaken by
the passion with which she had spoken&mdash;shaken and surprised. What
did it mean, this storm of enthusiasm, and what was to be the outcome
of it? I could not guess. It was long before my heart began to beat
equably again, and then I felt incapable of thought, exhausted, as one
snatched up to the heights where living is a delirium.</p>

<p>It was late at night, and everyone was waiting for the beds to be
made up before she came in. She had evidently been crying. Her face was
startling in its pallor; the eyes seemed half-dead and drooping like
flowers beaten by heavy rain.She made no attempt to conceal her tears,
but simply sat down in her corner wiping her eyes, and sighing heavily
from time to time. My heart wept with her; I longed to take her in my
arms and kiss the tears away. She was unlike anybody else in the world,
I thought, nobler at once and weaker. And so I tried to tell her as I
said good-night, bowing low before her and kissing her hand with a
strange mixture of tenderness and veneration. She understood my tacit
sympathy, for as I lifted my head she took it in her hands and kissed
me on the forehead before them all. I went out of the carriage
trembling with emotion, prouder and happier than I had ever been in my
life. As the hours passed, however, my old self, that had been crushed
and silenced by the whirlwind of her passion, slowly rose again, and
soon convinced me that Sonia was wrong, altogether wrong. I determined
to persuade her that she was mistaken, to show her that what had been,
must be; for the one unchangeable thing in the world is the nature of
man, and that determines all his institutions. If the institutions are
bad it is because of a corresponding vileness in mankind. One had as
much right to complain of the top hat as of a king, both answered to
some idiotic desire in man, or they would not exist&mdash;</p>

<p>We passed through Petersburg at night: it was quite eleven o'clock
before we reached the little station four miles from their country
house. We got to our journey's end in complete darkness, and I could
see nothing but a long, low building. What I noticed this first night
was the obsequious yetboisterous affection of a host of servants, male
and female.</p>

<p>In the morning I saw the place better. Sonia, the gay Sonia, the
Sonia I had known for one or two days in Vienna, had come to life
again; she knocked at my door before I was half dressed, and cried to
me to hurry down, for she wanted to show me everything.</p>

<p>How I wish I could paint her as I found her, framed in the French
window against the dazzling sunshine of that summer morning. Always
striking in appearance, she yet varied more in looks than most women;
she was often almost plain, but now and then her beauty struck me as
pure witchery, and this happened to be one of her rare days. She always
parted her hair at the side like a boy, which gave a strange alert look
to her face. And this look was quickened and deepened now by the
incomparable warmth of her eyes into an expression so soulful and
courageous that I only wanted to love and kiss her. Her dress always
seemed to be perfectly simple and careless. I have been told that such
dresses are the most costly, but I don't think that was true in her
case. They often fitted badly, but the rounded grace of her figure was
not to be disguised by a crease or a fold. The moment I came into the
room she held out both hands to me, and then taking my arm whirled me
out of doors. I was to see everything, and at once.</p>

<p>"But first you must know," she began breathlessly, "that this house
was built a long time ago. In 1730 or '40 my great-grandfather, who had
spent some years at the French court, came backto live here. He had
forgotten his Russian, and had to curse the servants in French.
Three-quarters of the house was in existence before his time; but he
determined to level it with the ground and build a palace here after
the fashion of Versailles. He had the best intentions, the dear man!
But the first thing was to have an avenue of trees, for trees take time
to grow, so the trees must come first he thought. The house, you see
faces north. My great-grandfather thought a house should face south; he
therefore began to construct his avenue of trees from the kitchen door,
meaning when he rebuilt the house to make the entrance there. Come, I
will show it you," and she swept me off round the house to a superb
avenue of trees, which did indeed begin opposite the kitchen door, on
the further side of the great unpaved dirty yard. "Come along," she
said, and we walked rapidly down the avenue of alternate chestnut and
acacia trees for more than half a mile. Some distance from the house
the ground dropped suddenly, and when we got to the slope Sonia pointed
out to me that the avenue ended in a swamp.</p>

<p>"Yes," she cried, laughing merrily, "my great-grandfather thought
nothing of the swamp; when he came upon it he determined to drain it,
and he set to work. You shall come and see the little summer-house in
it that I built in memory of the great Andr&eacute;; for I have a
sneaking regard&mdash;in spite of your wise counsels&mdash;for my
half-mad great-grandfather, who would make avenues and drain swamps and
build a Versailles here in thewilds. I see what you are thinking, sir,"
she went on, nodding her head with childish gaiety. "You are thinking
that I like my great-grandfather because I am like him. It is perhaps
true, you sober Englishman; but is not the avenue beautiful, though it
is of no use and does not serve any purpose of parade? I love my avenue
better because it is like no other avenue in the world. Here the trees
grow and flower all by themselves, content to fill the air with perfume
and take the eye with beauty. They would be covered with dust if we
drove up and down between them. My grandfather's ideas of perfection
have a good deal to say for themselves even in this world." And she
looked at me with those strange luminous eyes as if she had half
divined my mental attitude.</p>

<p>I am glad to say that for the moment I did not feel inclined to
argue, but replied merrily, "I think your great-grandfather a wonderful
person, and his avenue quite beautiful. I suppose he meant to continue
it to the high road?"</p>

<p>"Four versts off," she nodded gravely, "and he did too, but the
swamp in the middle of it would not be drained, and there is about a
hundred yards of road made at the end of the avenue to run into the
main road, and that's all. You see," she said laughing, "French ideas
could not survive in Russia; dear, lazy, happy-go-lucky Russia wouldn't
have a Versailles and so my grandfather died before he had half carried
out his plans." After a pause she added, in a lower tone, "Untamed and
untamable Russia wasn't to learn French ways. Perhaps," she continued
gravely, "it will showitself just as rebellious to English ideas and
English ways."</p>

<p>But I would not be drawn. She was too perfect as she was; the day
was too bright; I was too pleased to find her in such a happy mood to
disturb it with</p>

<p>arguments; so I laughed at her and with her, and we took our way
back to the house and breakfast arm in arm.</p>

<p>But somewhere in the depths of me there was a desire to refute her
arguments and convert her, and sooner or later I was bound to speak. We
were in the little summer-house, I remember, one afternoon with the
swaying willow branches in front of us, when I began:</p>

<p>"I wonder, Sonia, if you would let me try to show you why I do not
agree with your views about society and its reformation."</p>

<p>She turned to me with positive fear in her face, and clasping her
hands on the table cried: "Oh, don't!" but a moment afterwards she
added:</p>

<p>"I knew it would come to speech. I knew it would. What a pity!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh," she replied abruptly, "do you think we need to speak in order
to be understood? I think we often feel things more clearly than words
can render them. I knew your thoughts. I felt the antagonism in you all
the while. Besides you have a way of your own of talking, my friend.
When you hear something you don't like, your brows go up, your jaws
set, and your eyes flash; I'm not blind. But go on," she added, "I will
listen. Isometimes wish I could be persuaded," she concluded
wistfully.</p>

<p>I was discouraged at the outset. I felt that the attempt would make
me lose ground with her, but it seemed to me merely honest to go
on&mdash;a sort of duty to her and myself&mdash;so I did my best.</p>

<p>"You think institutions can be altered," I began, "because they
don't suit you, don't accord with your ideas of right and justice and
goodness. But institutions are there because men are what they are. The
institutions are not made to suit you, Sonia, an extraordinary woman,
but the average man, and they do suit him fairly well or he would alter
them."</p>

<p>She did not reply, but I could see that she was listening. I went on
in the same strain for some time; she heard me out in silence, and then
replied in a gentle, hopeless, tolerant way:</p>

<p>"I think you answer yourself," she began. "You are still half a
Christian, aren't you? Well, has not Jesus altered the world? Is he not
altering men still? making them ashamed of their brutal passions and
brutish selfishness. Surely, my friend, you must see that you are on
the wrong side, on the side of immobility, while I am on the side of
progress. Men linger on the upward path to satisfy their baser
appetites. You should not defend that."</p>

<p>I was not persuaded. "If man climbs fast," I began, "he falls back
again. We English tried to go fast with Cromwell and fell back with
Charles II.</p>

<p>You would put a Cromwell out of breath. Ifwe were to adopt your rate
of progress we should need a Christ in every street."</p>

<p>"Even that does not seem impossible to me," she cried, starting to
her feet and beginning to pace backwards and forwards as if she needed
a physical outlet for her emotion: "Nothing is impossible: there are no
limits to what the soul may do. . . . You talk of a Christ in every
street; but you have forgotten that there is a woman in every house.
Look what we have already done for the humanization and refinement of
man, and what we are still doing. He is ashamed now to be dissolute and
drunken; he will soon be ashamed of greed and self-seeking. Woman is
gradually moulding man to her ideal! For ages she has done it
unconsciously, now that she is beginning to do it consciously the
progress will be more rapid than you can imagine."</p>

<p>"Just as Russia is a new factor in the problem," she went on, after
a pause, "so is woman. She is bound by no traditions; it is for her to
make her own traditions. The women of to-day have to set the example;
they will find followers! It was Jeanne d'Arc that made Charlotte
Corday possible."</p>

<p>She had got into her habitual train of thought, and now she talked
with a passion of spiritual exaltation that thrilled me in spite of
myself.</p>

<p>"How men miss-see their saviours! No one has written a real life of
Charlotte Corday, and yet she was the first of the great modern women,
greater, I think, even than Jeanne d'Arc, for she had no faith to
sustain her, only her own great heart. Don't you know what she said
about her deed when the Public Prosecutor tried to make out that she
was the assassin of a great and good man? 'I have killed him,' she
said, 'and he is dead. You cannot kill great men.' And she was right;
she had killed him. After his death they started Marat hats in Paris,
and Marat this and Marat that, but the vile worship could not last.
Within the year his body was taken from the grave and tossed in dust to
the winds! Charlotte Corday had killed him; he was dead."</p>

<p>There were tears in her voice and eyes as she spoke. It was all so
real to her that I answered her half afraid:</p>

<p>"Surely you would not do evil&mdash;and such evil&mdash;that good
might come."</p>

<p>She stopped with a great sigh and sat down at the table, shaking her
head as if in utter hopelessness. I had to repeat my question; and then
she replied slowly&mdash;half-wearily:</p>

<p>"Do you ask that seriously? What a creature of convention you are!
What a load you carry about with you of outworn moral platitudes! Would
you take one life to save ten thousand? That's the question. I would. I
would&mdash;gladly."</p>

<p>"You must not speak like that, dear," I said, putting my hand on her
clasped hands. She turned and looked at me with a great, glad resolve
in her eyes that shocked me. A moment or two afterwards she said, "Let
us go into the air," and by a sort of unconscious agreement we began to
talk of ordinary things. I made up my mind not to excite her again if I
could help it;opposition seemed only to confirm her in her wild,
impracticable enthusiasms.</p>

<p>For days and days my purpose of self-repression held, and indeed the
next serious talk that we had was wholly different. I had been noticing
the way she waited on her brother, and her pleasure in the service. She
tried to amuse him and interest him at home; she evidently dreaded the
life of the capital for him. In fact, she told me once that she only
stayed in the country house for Andrushka and because it suited her
mother's health. Self-abnegation sat lightly on her; she seemed to take
delight in it; I could not help telling her one morning how much I
admired her for this.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried, blushing, "don't praise me for unselfishness nor
set me on a pedestal for anything! I am not worthy of it. I have had
terrible fights with myself; to make myself decent at all was hard. As
a child I was a wretched little animal.</p>

<p>"You perhaps ought to know something," she went on; "at any rate, it
will put you right about me, and take some of the dirty conceit out of
me. As a child I was a sort of unconscious liar," and she flushed
again. "I used to romance, say I had met people, and that they had said
things to me, and my mother and Andr&eacute; used to believe me, which
encouraged me to go on. Of course, as I grew older I became a little
ashamed of myself for this and tried to stop it, but it was very hard
to break it off. I was always romancing, and once or twice I got caught
or half caught, and nearly died of shame. But the world of my fancy was
alwaysas vivid to me as the real world, so I went on lying for years
and years. Then I met that man I told you of, Michailoff. He first gave
me faith in myself, faith that I could do something worth the doing,
that I was one&mdash;" and again she flushed. "He taught me a great
deal, too. I owe him much. Of course, I began to make a hero of him,
began to care for him, and then found out that he was base&mdash;a
brute, and a liar. He was making up to one I had thought my friend,
Hetty Helfmann, all the time he was telling me that I was the only
woman in the world for him. A liar! But it was the faith he had given
me in myself that made me hate my lying, so I made up my mind to say
every sentence over to myself and see whether it was true, before I
uttered it. That makes my speech slow very often, even now. Ah, you
have noticed it," she cried, looking at me.</p>

<p>"I have noticed the abruptness of speech," I answered, "and the
pauses, without understanding the reason. It always seems to me that
you ought to speak very quickly."</p>

<p>"I used to," she went on; "lies come quickly off the tongue; it is
the exact truth that is slow. I often exaggerate still. But that does
not matter now; nothing matters now. Besides," she began, as if falling
into a new train of thought, "I have not the vestige of a desire now to
deceive any one in the world, . . . But I must go down to the village.
No, you cannot come with me; it would only hurt them," and off she
started on some mission of kindness.</p>

<p>Our next talk was about this village and thepoor in it. Her mother
had said at luncheon that it was silly to waste money on the villagers;
for there was no gratitude in them.</p>

<p>"I don't do it for a reward, mother," Sonia replied.</p>

<p>"Why do you do it?" I asked curiously.</p>

<p>"To appease my sympathy, I think," she said, "and because they need
it."</p>

<p>"Need it indeed!" sniffed the mother. "What nonsense!"</p>

<p>"The whole dispute, mother, was about the laundress and what you
paid her. I said that her prices were very cheap, for by rights she
should be paid what you would give, rather than do the work yourself.
But you only give what competition, that is, the necessities of the
poor, compel them to accept. I say that is as much theft as any other
robbery by force. We are worse than thieves, too, for we rob without
running any risk. I am sick of it all&mdash;the poor degraded by
poverty and the rich debased by luxury and power."</p>

<p>"Yet One said that the poor would always be with us," I
interjected.</p>

<p>She turned on me at once. "I don't think the poor suffered when He
was with them."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad, Mr. Lascelles," said the mother, "that you are
taking her to task. She keeps the whole village; it is absurd. And look
how she is dressed&mdash;ridiculous! she owes it to her position and
name to be properly dressed. But no! she would rather play Lady
Bountiful to a pack of cunning ne'er-do-weels."</p>

<p>While the mother was speaking, a verse that Iread at Oxford came
into my head, the verse of a woman poet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pbq">"They shall take all to buy them bread; take all I have
to give.<br>
 I, if I perish, perish; they to-day shall eat and live."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The feeling of Christina Rossetti was the same as that of Sonia; but
something in me that I thought was reason, fought against the emotion
and I used my knowledge against my sympathy. I don't know why I did it;
I was warned by the look in Sonia's face, but I could not refrain from
adding something that I thought effective to my argument of the day
before.</p>

<p>"It is curious," I said, "how every spiritual movement has its
drawbacks. The Crusades were due to a wave of spiritual enthusiasm, and
the Crusaders brought back with them to Europe the vilest disease known
to our civilization. Curious, too, how material progress is bound up
with spiritual advancement; men accumulate wealth, and art immediately
comes to humanize them."</p>

<p>"Pure scepticism&mdash;all that," replied Sonia sharply. "Scepticism
that has never done anything good in the world. It merely lames right
action; it should be called the devil's advocate. You are always on the
wrong side, my friend."</p>

<p>I was wounded by the coldness in her voice, and so I persisted:</p>

<p>"After all," I said, "it is not scepticism but plain truth that our
social laws&mdash;payments, punishments and the rest&mdash;are merely
the outcome of the forces, the men and women who make up thecommunity.
The height of a pyramid must bear a proportion to the breadth of the
base, and the base must always rest on the ground&mdash;in the
mud."</p>

<p>"It is false," Sonia cried, starting up and speaking with
astonishing vehemence. "False and vile. You make life mechanical. You
crush the soul. How can you take that side? I can't endure it," and she
left the room.</p>

<p>"Don't mind, Mr. Lascelles," said the mother soothingly, "she will
get over her tantrums soon."</p>

<p>"That's just like Sonia," said Andr&eacute;. "She keeps us all here
for our health, eh, mother? but I believe it is because she likes to
play queen to those cursed villagers. I'm sick of the place," and he
yawned.</p>

<p>As soon as I decently could, I went after Sonia, whom I found in the
avenue. I walked with her, but as soon as I began to speak, she
cried:</p>

<p>"No more arguments, my friend, no more arguments. You are you, and I
am I. In either case the tree has got to its full height now and cannot
be bent or altered. Words have no effect on our natures. Character is
not to be changed by a little breath. It was folly to think that."</p>

<p>"No, no," she went on, preventing me from speaking, "I will not hear
you again. I understand now. Your English view of life is Chinese. You
accept what you call 'facts'&mdash;the lower the better. Your society
is all mechanical, caged in conventions; you excuse your selfishness by
talking of necessity&mdash;'things are because they must be'&mdash;and
you choke us with 'what is, shall be.' I will not have it. I don't
believe it. The world to me is fluid, men and women
malleable&mdash;everything noble is possible."</p>

<p>"But think," I cried, "you contradict yourself. You have just argued
that character is stable, and cannot be altered by mere arguments. Now
you say we are infinitely malleable."</p>

<p>"What do I care for contradictions?" she replied impatiently. "I see
both sides of the shield, that is all. But in the main I am against
you, against you heart and soul. I think nobly of men and you think
ignobly of them. Each time that I talk with you I go away with my soul
fainting and weak. Yes, I must say it. I know that if I married you and
went to England, I should live a life of ease and comfort, and at every
turn my woman's vanity would be tickled and pleased. I should be made
much of and everything would go well with me. You care for me too and
are kind and good. But the soul in me would die. I should pass my life
ignobly, and&mdash;God help me&mdash;perhaps I should get to love my
prison of scented cotton wool. That frightens me. The soul in me would
die there, I tell you&mdash;the enthusiasm and the resolution&mdash;and
I live for them and for nothing else. I would rather suffer a thousand
deaths than give up my beliefs; they redeem me to myself." And she
turned from me and walked quickly into the house.</p>

<p>As she went, fear fell upon me, abject fear. I had lost her. What a
fool and brute I was! I had spoken against my feelings too; she was
right,and again the line came back and sang itself in my ears:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pbq">"I, if I perish, perish; they to-day shall eat and
live."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Almost I resolved to seek her out and tell her that there should be
no more controversy, no more disagreement between us, that I would work
with her. But something masculine in me rebelled against this as
weakness; and reason&mdash;or perhaps dialectic&mdash;began to furnish
me with arguments against her. There could be no doubt that in the main
the poor were incapable and wastrels and the well-to-do industrious and
provident&mdash;that was the truth to anchor to. . . .</p>

<p>I spent the whole day and nearly the whole night fighting with
myself, heart against head, and only won rest by persuading myself that
Sofia couldn't give me up. The fear that she might do so was baseless,
I argued; I had never heard nor read of such abandonment for a mere
idea.</p>

<p>But next day I had difficulty in finding her. She avoided me. When I
asked after her I was told by the servant with uplifted hands and
eyebrows, that she was probably locked in her room, that nobody could
find her. I was conscious that these were only excuses, but consoled
myself with the idea that I should see her at the midday meal and then
get a chance to talk to her. The hours went by on feet of lead. At last
the bell rang for lunch. I was more than disappointed&mdash;I was
heart-sick with fear, when I saw that she was not in her place and that
no one seemed to notice her absence. I asked after her and was told
that shehad probably eaten in her room. Andr&eacute; was almost certain
that he had seen her going out walking as he came down to dinner.
Immediately the meal was over, I went among the outdoor servants and
found this was true; Sonia had gone out by herself and might be away
the whole day, they said.</p>

<p>All that afternoon I spent wandering about the house&mdash;like a
dog without its master, as I thought to myself bitterly&mdash;waiting,
looking, longing for the form that never came; and all the while my
fear grew, the fear of irreparable loss.</p>

<p>The long summer day dragged to its end; the rose lights faded out of
the sky; the gathering shadows chilled me. It was ten o'clock before I
saw her coming up the avenue; and, strange to say, as soon as I saw
her, my fears fled and a sort of irritation and anger took their place.
How could she hurt me so? I would not go to meet her; I would stand and
let her come to me. She was in the wrong, not I. But when she saw
me,&mdash;and she did not see me till she was within twenty yards of
me, for I was in the shadow of the trees&mdash;she stopped too, and for
a moment made as if she would leave the avenue and go into the house by
the side door through the orchard. That hurt me inexpressibly, and with
the pain my fears came back on me with a rush; all the irritation
vanished and I went quickly to her with a reproachful:</p>

<p>"Sonia, I have waited all day for you."</p>

<p>When I saw her face, I was tenfold more pitiful. It was pale and
drawn with great violet rings round the eyes; she had evidently been
crying.</p>

<p>"Oh," I went on hurriedly, "Sonia, what haveI done?" Let us love
each other and think of nothing else. It is too terrible to be parted
from you." As she nodded slowly, I took her in my arms. I was glad she
did not speak. I went on talking to comfort her, telling her how I had
waited and longed for her and how glad I was to see her; but I suddenly
noticed that although she was very gentle and let her hand rest in
mine, she was walking steadily to the house, and when I tried to
restrain her, she looked up at me with the brave eyes and said
quietly:</p>

<p>"I am worn out, George; I must rest."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," I said, again walking on by her side. "But
you will see me to-morrow, won't you? I want to be with you." I would
not even say that I wanted to talk to her for fear of alarming her, and
she bowed her head in agreement. As we came to the house, I kissed her
hand:</p>

<p>"Good-night, Sonia." She seemed to bend her head just a little as
she passed through the door. To describe the conflict of my feelings
that night would be impossible to me. As is usual I fear in such cases,
I began by blaming myself, and as her influence on me faded I ended by
blaming Sonia. After all she was unreasonable; the poor were the
wastrels and the rich were the efficient. Of course, there were
exceptions, numberless exceptions, but that was the rule and the rule
made for progress, for right. I would not disguise my convictions on
that point; it would be treason to my intelligence. But then all my
resolution was shaken by the memory of her pitiful, pale face, and I
resolved to be as sweet to her as I could be, to makeeverything easy to
her; for I loved her and I had no doubt in spite of what had passed
that she loved me. And loving each other I felt sure that all would
come right&mdash;in time.</p>

<p>I did not see her in the forenoon, but word was brought to me from
her about eleven o'clock that she would be down to lunch and would see
me in the afternoon. After lunch we went out and, by some unconscious
agreement, walked round the house and down the avenue to the
summer-house in the swamp, Sonia's favourite place. She seemed very
quiet, unnaturally quiet. That brought back my fears, and the conflict
going on within me, the old conflict between my head and my heart,
confused me; but when we were seated in the summerhouse and the brave
sad eyes looked at me, I knew what to say&mdash;the truth. I would tell
her the simple truth. And I did, and she listened to me to the end
without a word; only when I told her how I had doubted her love, she
stroked my head with her hand pitifully. Helped by that cue I dwelt on
my love for her and her love for me. I could not help saying at the
end:</p>

<p>"If I lost you, Sonia, now, I should go mad, I think. I know I
should not care for anything else in the world or be worth anything; I
should be given over to the devil."</p>

<p>At once her brows knit and her face grew cold.</p>

<p>"You must not talk like that," she said, "it is not true, I am
sure."</p>

<p>"But you see what I mean," I cried, shifting my ground quickly. "In
heart I am with you altogether, and my brain sympathizes with muchthat
you say. Give me a little time. Whatever you wish to do for the poor
shall be done, whatever you wish to give to them, shall be given.
Together we will fight every abuse, every injustice. I will try to live
as you would have me live; but you must not speak of leaving me; that
hardens me, brings out all the worst in me."</p>

<p>She shook her head slowly. "Oh, my friend," she said, and there was
infinite tenderness and regret in her voice, "the trouble is deeper,
far deeper. Don't let us deceive ourselves. You are an Englishman and I
am a Russian&mdash;that's the real difficulty. You could only be happy
and strong and at your best in England, and I cannot give up Russia.
Look," and she spoke hurriedly, "before I met you I was bound to her in
a hundred ways, by a hundred ties. Over there in Petersburg there are
men and women who need me and I have promised myself to them. I cannot
draw back now."</p>

<p>"But how would our love and marriage interfere with that? " I asked,
with a terrible sinking at heart, a terrible dread.</p>

<p>"What right," she answered, "have I to sacrifice you? None; I should
ruin your life, blast it.</p>

<p>By what right?"</p>

<p>"By the right," I broke in, "that I wish it, that I am eager to give
it."</p>

<p>She put her hand on my mouth. "Hush, hush," she said. "I am not
willing. I could not work with you beside me. My own life is mine to
break and throw away as I please; but yours&mdash;oh, I could do
nothing if you were there. I should bea coward for you, and I shall
need all my courage."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked harshly, feeling myself grow pale with
anger. In some way or other I was certain then that her resolution was
irrevocable. "I offer to share your life whatever it may be. You tell
me that you will not accept my companionship. Then you don't love me.
If you loved me, you could not speak like that."</p>

<p>"Ah," she cried wildly, "why do you tempt me and torture me?" And
with a supreme effort at self-control, she rose and came over to me,
and I drew her down on my knee and she laid her head beside mine.</p>

<p>"Don't say such things," she said to me. "You mustn't even think
them. I love you too well," she whispered, "I love to put my face
against yours. Hush, don't look," she went on, holding my head, for I
tried to draw away from her to look at her. "If you look I can't tell
you. But when you touch me, George, when our hands meet just by chance,
I thrill from head to foot; all my body cries for you. Ah, God, if I
did not love you, how easy it would all be! How easy it would be to
part from you and never see you again and go on with my work. But now
it is hard, so hard," and her voice had a pitiful break in it. "It is
worse than death to leave you; but I must, I must.&mdash;My work calls
me, my work&mdash;"</p>

<p>She put my head from her resolutely and stood up with her hands in
front of her face, and as she shook the tears away, she walked out of
the hut. I sat and saw her go. What was there to say? Ifelt an
immovable resolution in her, and I was exhausted with the strain. There
I sat in the hut with my dead hopes about me, my heart aching and my
brain numb. I could feel nothing, could not think; but the verse sang
itself in my ears with a sort of insane exaltation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pbq">"I, if I perish, perish; in the name of God I go."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How long I stayed in the hut I don't know. I left it like a wounded
animal, with one fear in me&mdash;that I should go mad, with one
wish&mdash;to tire my body to a rag and then sleep. I walked for hours,
driving myself on whenever I noticed that my pace slackened, and yet
with some unconscious purpose of making a round and getting back to the
house at last. It was after midnight when I returned. The short summer
night was quickening to the dawn and I was glad of it; it had been a
terrible day; I was glad to have done with it, glad. When I awoke I
felt perfectly refreshed and curiously composed and contented. There
was a little dull pain about my heart I noticed, but that would go off,
I thought, with delight, and I pulled the curtains back and threw the
window up and stretched myself in the sunlight. I even went so far as
to jest with myself; if Sonia did not care for me, perhaps some one
else would, and if no one would, a state of single-blessedness was not
so bad, after all. There was nothing to be gained by crying over spilt
milk and inscrutable women. As I got out of my tub, I whistled. The
cold water had done me good, brought me back completely to the
realities of existence. There issunshine in life, I said, and rubbed
myself hard. Nothing like exercise, sleep and a cold bath for us
English, I exulted: so we chase away fevered dreams and despairs. I
dressed quickly. But when I had dressed, the thought of meeting Sonia
came to me with a shock of fear that almost unnerved me. My mind was
made up, however, and in a moment I had regained self-control and
passed resolutely down-stairs. There was no one in the sitting-room, so
I went out into the orchard. I would not go back to the avenue. No, I
would walk about under the trees, and not think at all but enjoy the
sunshine and the song of birds. There, an hour later, a servant found
me; he brought me a letter. As I opened it, I felt my heart turn to
water; I knew it was from Sonia; it was very short.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pbq">"Dear One," it began, "It would be better for us not to
meet again for some time. I am suffering so much that I must beg you to
give me time and solitude to let me come to myself; I could not meet
you now. You will go to Petersburg, I know, to-day, and later perhaps
we may meet calmly.</p>

<p class="pbq">"She who loves you.</p>

<p class="pbq">"SONIA."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I folded the letter up again and smiled at the messenger like a
mandarin, and wondered as I walked away under the trees why I did not
fall; for sky and earth were whirling round me, and I could have
screamed with the pain. In a few moments I came to reason. So this was
my dismissal; curt enough, and complete enough. Rage cameinto me; I
turned and walked hastily to the house; and in ten minutes I had packed
my things. Then I sat down to write to her.</p>

<p>"Your wishes shall be followed, Sonia." I wrote; but I could not
close the letter there as I wanted to; my heart would not let me; in
spite of myself I added, "But I rely on your promise that we shall meet
again. I shall be at the &mdash;&mdash; Hotel."</p>

<p>I signed it boldly, "Your lover, George Lascelles."</p>

<p>It suddenly came to me that I could not meet her mother and brother
without betraying myself. I would write to them, too; and I wrote
hinting clearly to the mother that it was Sonia's will that I should go
at once and not mine, and giving my address very carefully at the
&mdash;&mdash; Hotel in Petersburg, as I had given it to Sonia. To the
brother I wrote still more briefly, thanking him for his kindness to
me, and hoping that he would let me see him when he came to town.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of that day I was in Petersburg. I immediately
dressed myself for dinner and went off to the Embassy. I must hunt up
one of our fellows there, I thought; I could not dine by myself: my
memories were terrible company. I dined with Green, the Green who has
since made a name for himself in diplomacy, and a jolly good dinner we
had, I remember. I enjoyed everything at the Restaurant
Fran&ccedil;ais, the careful service, the excellent food, and the
undeniable champagne. I had said to myself that I wouldn't think, and I
didn't; I simply chatteredto Green and listened to his chatter, and did
myself right well.</p>

<p>Looking back, as I am now doing, it seems to me that the most
curious point in my mental condition at this time was the fact that at
first I did not suffer. On the contrary, I felt a sense of relief, and
this relief was not chiefly due to the merging of anxiety into
certainty, but was positive and substantial. For days and days I was
like a schoolboy just released from school. I can only explain this
feeling by comparing Sonia's exaltation of mind to living high up a
mountainside where the air is thin and mere breathing an exertion. I
had been mentally on the strain for weeks, and now that the tension was
over I went back with delight to the old easeful way of life. This
relaxation had one consequence which at the moment I did not think of,
but which in the long run became of the greatest importance. When I
left&mdash;I meant to write to Sonia within the week. At the back of my
mind, indeed, I intended to write to her frequently; but the people at
the Embassy were extremely kind to me; the old life, with its calls,
dinners, and parties, very engrossing, and so I put off writing. At the
end of a fortnight it was harder to write than at the end of the week,
because I should have had to excuse or explain my silence, and I did
not feel inclined to invent lies. There was a little pique at the
bottom of me, I suppose towards Sonia, which strengthened my
disinclination to write; she had thrown me over, and my paltry vanity
took pleasure in sulking. For three or four weeks I went oncomfortably
enough. But as soon as my mind had rested and my spirits had regained
their tone, the society I was moving in, began to pall upon me; the
women seemed to me silly and frivolous, the men bored me. How was it, I
asked myself, that before Sonia took off the German <i>Frauen</i>, I
had never noticed how like women were to hens? They strutted about and
made little noises exactly like hens; their faces, too, had some
strange family likeness to the faces of hens, and their voices and
manners reminded me of a farmyard. Again and again I burst out laughing
at some unholy resemblance of this sort, and my merriment was sometimes
difficult to account for.</p>

<p>As mixed society grew more and more tedious to me, I withdrew from
it and began to give men's dinners. But soon the men, too, struck me as
affected and painfully dull; their conversation was as matter-of-fact
as the intercourse of animals, and I felt rising in me a sense of
contempt and indignation which I had never felt before and which I had
no right to feel, I who a few months before would have condemned
intellectual conversation as bad form, a sort of showing off. In sheer
disgust at the tedium of my fellows I withdrew from society altogether,
and began to live entirely alone. I worked a little at Russian, but
found the days drag. In the slow, heavy hours of solitude Sonia's face
came back to me, and the sense of my loss grew to pain, a pain of every
moment, an aching desire that increased in intensity, and seemed at
length to change the very nature of my mind. Instead of condemning
Sonia I began to condemnmyself, and at length I could only escape from
misery by putting Sonia on a pedestal as one of the most extraordinary
women in the world, and so excusing in part my own stupid resistance to
her influence. For now I saw clearly that she had been right and that I
had been mistaken, that the cause of progress and reform was the only
cause for a man to defend, and that I had sinned against the light in
trying to damp her enthusiasm. I took a pleasure now in going into the
poorer districts of Petersburg and helping poverty here and there, as I
thought Sonia would have liked me to do. The destitution and misery I
found on every side strengthened my newborn feelings and brought me
more and more into sympathy with Sonia's revolt. Indeed, so close did I
come to her in sympathy that one day I sat down and wrote her a long
letter, setting forth much of what I have put down here, but
particularly dwelling on the change in me, my conversion, I called it;
and in truth it was a conversion, for never again was I able to think
the old individualistic thoughts or to live the old life entirely
devoted to selfish enjoyment. I sent the letter to their country house.
It was Andr&eacute; who told me to send it there. From time to time I
still came across him in the fashionable quarter. He could never tell
me where his sister was or what she was doing; or, perhaps, he would
not tell me, though I am inclined to think he could not, for he did not
appear to take the slightest interest in what she was doing or where
she was staying.</p>

<p>"She is always about with dirty workmen," hesaid, "or with women
whose hair has been cut short and who look like ill-dressed boys. I
can't stand the set. She'll get herself locked up, if she doesn't look
out."</p>

<p>And so he went his way, burning his little bit of candle at both
ends.</p>

<p>After waiting a fortnight or so, I got an answer from Sonia. The
letter was lying on my table one afternoon when I came in. How hungrily
I read the address, how I played with my delight! I would not open the
letter, I would touch it just where her hand had touched it, and I
ended by kissing it again and again in a wild rapture. Her mere
influence transports one beyond reason, I thought with a smile. At
length I tore the envelope open and read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pbq">"Your letter made me glad for you and sorry for our
fate. It will be better for us not to meet yet.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Yours in all sympathy and affection,</p>

<p class="pbq">"SONIA."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After writing as I had written, I must have felt sure that she would
give me a meeting, for her letter was a terrible disappointment. For
some days everything was weary, flat and unprofitable to me; and then I
began to work again at my Russian in the morning, and in the afternoon
to go out among the poor.</p>

<p>One of the first days I went out I had rather a curious adventure.
In a workman's restaurant where I sometimes dined, I found a pretty
andrather well-dressed girl of Jewish type seated almost opposite my
accustomed place. She spoke to me first, I think, but I really paid so
little attention to the matter that I could not be sure. She was
pretty, very pretty, in a sort of rich sensuous way, but she did not
appeal to me. She seemed affected and a little common; but she
evidently knew the poor and the poorer districts of Petersburg
intimately, and I could not help admitting that she was not only well
educated but well read. Almost at the beginning of our conversation, I
remember, the talk fell on Turgenieff's "Fathers and Sons" and his
extraordinary picture of Bazarov, the Nihilist. But the girl would not
accept Bazarov as a representative of the Reform movement in Russia,
and her criticism had something in it.</p>

<p>"Bazarov," she said, "is a hard, selfish brute, while the very
essence of the Reform movement is unselfish devotion to others. If you
only knew some of the real leaders of reform&mdash;Bakounine's nephew,
for instance, or Michailoff, they are Nihilists if you like."</p>

<p>I pricked up my ears at the name. "Ah," I said, "tell me about
Michailoff, will you? Do you know him well?"</p>

<p>She cast her eyes down in a little confusion that seemed to me
chiefly pretence, as I asked her whether she knew Michailoff; but in a
moment she regained her self-possession and said demurely:</p>

<p>"At one time I knew him very well. He is an extraordinary man and
devoted to the cause. You ought to meet him."</p>

<p>"I should like to," I replied coldly. "But cannot you tell me about
him, what he does, how he shows his devotion?"</p>

<p>"He was left fairly well-off, you know," she began, "his father was
a shopkeeper, I think, in Little Russia; but he lives just like a
workman, allows himself only ten roubles a week and gives all the rest
to the Nihilist propaganda. He is sure to be arrested one of these
days."</p>

<p>This last phrase convinced me that she knew Michailoff better than
she wished to appear to know him. I was right; she tried again and
again to find out from me where I had heard of him and why I took an
interest in him; but her whole being was common and insincere and I
told her nothing.</p>

<p>I did not return to the restaurant for a fortnight; but when I went
back again, I found her in the same place as before. That gave me
pause, made me vaguely suspicious and put me on my guard with her. She
seemed over-dressed now and coarser than ever, but she met me with a
great show of frankness.</p>

<p>"I must introduce myself," she said, almost as soon as I sat down.
"My name is Hetty Helfmann." I bowed and told her my name.</p>

<p>"I remembered what you said," she began, "about wishing to meet some
of the real leaders of the revolutionary party, but they naturally
avoid strangers, and Michailoff is so taken up with his new flame that
I could not get him to promise to give us even an hour of his valuable
time."</p>

<p>"Indeed," I replied coldly; but she went on, with affected
carelessness:</p>

<p>"It is Sonia this and Sonia that with him now. He can talk of
nothing else." And her eyes searched me as she spoke.</p>

<p>I felt myself flushing; but if I could not control my blood, I could
my tongue, and I did not give her the satisfaction of asking a single
question about Sonia. I would not bring her name again on those lips. I
was put to it to turn the conversation, but found the easiest way was
to talk to Miss Helfmann about herself; and so I began with awkward
directness to praise her hat and dress, knowing, with my new-born
insight into women&mdash;insight that was half contempt&mdash;that she
would take a compliment to her hat as if it were paid to herself. She
was delighted, and kept asking for more sweets, like a greedy child. I
gave them to her till I thought her appetite for flattery should be
satisfied, and then got up and regretted that I'd have to go away. She
tried in vain to keep me, and when I persisted that I had an
appointment, she betrayed herself:</p>

<p>"By the way, I forgot," she said, "I wanted to tell you that
Michailoff is always to be found now, at the afternoon meetings, in a
house in &mdash;&mdash; Street. His new mistress goes there, too, I
believe; she is thinner than ever, and dresses down to Michailoff's
taste."</p>

<p>I put on an affectation of interest as if I were trying to seem
interested and was not, and went away with the sound of her malicious
laughter in my ears. She had evidently given the address in order that
I might go to one of the meetings&mdash;probably with the hope that I
might turn out tobe a closer friend of Sonia's than Michailoff would
like.</p>

<p>I found myself saying, "She would stop at nothing, that woman,
nothing!" and I made up my mind to warn Sonia. But then her last letter
came into my mind, and in the light of what the cursed Jewess had said
I began to think she no longer cared for me. Of course, the Jewess's
story was all lies; Sonia was not Michailoff's mistress; but it was
strange that she should meet him, after speaking of him as base and a
liar. She went on meeting him, too; I was sure the Jewess had told me
the truth in this particular; for, by giving me the time and the place
of the meeting, she had given me the power of verifying her story. The
poison got into my blood and worked there&mdash;Sonia and Michailoff
together every afternoon; Sonia, who would not meet me, who would not
take the trouble to write me more than two or three lines. Strange,
too, how she knew that private room in the Vienna restaurant. Was I
doing her wrong by the suspicion? Perhaps. Perhaps not, too. What did I
know about her, after all? One thing was certain; she was with
Michailoff every afternoon. I did not write to warn her. I put it
off.</p>

<p>Those meetings of mine with the Jewess must have taken place in
October, for it was December and the terrible northern winter had laid
icy hands on the city before anything else happened to me of note. By
this time I had got to understand Russian and to speak it a little, and
I used to move about with much greater freedom than heretofore.One
afternoon I had been in the poorer quarters and was hurrying back to
the hotel, for it had begun to snow, when I saw a figure moving before
me that I could not mistake even in the gloom. It set all my pulses
throbbing; it was Sonia, I felt sure. I walked a little more rapidly
and drew up to within fifteen or twenty yards of her and was certain;
no one else moved like that. At the sight my anger and suspicion melted
away. For some reason or other I was conscious that the story told of
her, and my suspicions of her were alike unworthy and false. I was
surprised to find how glad I was to see her, how much I wanted to speak
to her, to meet her once again, to take measure of the distance she and
I had travelled since the summer; and I quickened my pace. Suddenly I
thought, "if I speak to her in the street, she may choke me off," and
then the thought of the "meeting" came to me and at once it seemed the
better plan to follow her to the "meeting," for then I should see her
for perhaps half an hour and certainly have a talk with her at the
end.</p>

<p>We carry, I notice, the mental atmosphere of our home with us
wherever we go. A "meeting" the Jewess had said, and the impression
left on my mind was that of a political meeting such as might take
place among Radicals in England. If I had exercised my thought upon the
matter consciously I should have known that this was not the case; but
I did not like to think about it, and so the word took its meaning from
the associations of my past.</p>

<p>Sonia walked on rapidly without looking behindher, and it was with a
shock that I found myself passing by the side of the Fortress Peter and
Paul and then turning into a narrow street behind it. Evidently the
Jewess had given me the right address. In a minute or two more Sonia
entered a house with just a nod to the police watchman at the door. I
followed within half-a-dozen yards of her. The man started up as if to
stop me; but I had quickened my pace to overtake Sonia, and I suppose
the intention to speak to her was already in my face, for he let me
pass without a word. On the second landing I was at her heels. Her name
was almost on my lips when she opened a door and went into a room;
before she could close the door I had passed in after her, saying
"Sonia."</p>

<p>She turned and saw me, but before she spoke, before she turned, I
had time to realise that the meeting was not such a meeting as I had
unconsciously expected. The room was a large one, almost destitute of
furniture; there was no ikon in it, I noticed, and the stove had
evidently only been lit a short time; for they still kept the door of
it open to get a draught and some of the smoke had blown through the
room and made it look particularly comfortless. But what surprised me
was that the room had fifteen or twenty men in it and no women at all,
and it was evident at first glance that these men were of a better
class than their clothes would lead one to believe. Some were dressed
like common workmen, others like artisans, others again like poor
clerks, but one look at their faces showed that many of them were
masquerading.</p>

<p>As Sonia entered the room, a man detached himself from the group and
came towards her. I put him down at once in my mind as
Michailoff&mdash;a man about thirty-five, of medium height, with small
golden-brown moustache. He was very
good-looking&mdash;distinguished-looking even&mdash;in spite of his
clothes.</p>

<p>As Sonia turned to me, she cried in wonder, "You here! Did you
follow me?" The emphasis she laid on the word "follow" made me flush
hotly.</p>

<p>"I did," I replied. The astonishment visible in the men's faces, and
the angry surprise of Michailoff prevented me showing the embarrassment
felt and gave me self-control. "I did," I repeated; "but your friends,"
and I pointed to the circle, "do not seem pleased to see me." I would
let them understand, at any rate, that I was not desirous of
conciliating them.</p>

<p>"This is no place for you," she said hurriedly. "You should net have
come here. You must go away at once."</p>

<p>"Not at once, surely," said Michailoff, coming forward and speaking
in Russian. "We must know who the gentleman is and how he found his way
here."</p>

<p>Sonia answered him in Russian shortly:</p>

<p>"I will be responsible for him;" and then turning to me she said in
French:</p>

<p>"But now you must go at once."</p>

<p>"I understood what your friend said," I remarked quietly, "and also
what you answered; but I do not see why you should make
yourselfresponsible for me. I saw you walking before me, I followed you
at a short distance, surely there is no crime in that." I spoke in
Russian so that they might all understand. I wanted to defy them
all&mdash;all these men who met Sonia every day and could be with her
hour after hour when she would not give me five minutes. I suppose she
felt the antagonism between me and the others, for she simply said to
them:</p>

<p>"I will be back immediately," then took me by the arm, saying, "Come
with me," and drew me outside the door.</p>

<p>We were alone together, and the outside world fell away from me.
Later I knew that as soon as the door closed upon us there arose inside
the room a hubbub of indistinguishable voices; but at the moment I was
unconscious of this; Sonia was with me and that was enough. I had no
time to think of what I should say, so what I did say came from my
unconscious self, from the heart.</p>

<p>"I want to see you, Sonia," I cried, "and your letter was so
cold."</p>

<p>Her eyes did not yield to me. She remarked bitterly:</p>

<p>"I suppose your new friend, Miss Helfmann, told you where you would
find me?"</p>

<p>Instead of answering the accusation and confirming her suspicion, I
simply thought of clearing myself:</p>

<p>"She is no friend of mine," I replied hotly. "A vulgar Jewess. Since
I saw her the second time, I have never been again to the restaurant
Imet her in. You cannot have thought that I would care to meet such a
creature."</p>

<p>I spoke hotly, but it was warm at my heart that Sonia did care about
my intercourse with the Jewess. At once she melted to me, and with the
old gesture I loved so much, she stretched out both hands to me, and as
I took them and kissed them again and again, she said:</p>

<p>"I believe you; you speak the truth always. How good it is to be
able to trust. But now you must really go. You are in danger here."</p>

<p>"Danger," I questioned, "from your friends?"</p>

<p>She flushed to the temples, and I could have kissed her for it.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, bravely, "but don't ask me why or wherefore.
Promise me that you will never speak of this place again, or of our
meeting here. Not to anyone&mdash;and I will meet you again. I always
meant to give you a meeting," and her eyes rested on mine.</p>

<p>"If that's a promise, Sonia," I said, "I can go on working
cheerfully and wait your time."</p>

<p>"It is a promise," she said simply. But I could not part from her
like that; as she turned to go I threw my arms around her, and drew her
to me, and kissed her on the forehead and on the hair, and said again
and again:</p>

<p>"I love you, I love you, I love you, my heart's delight!"</p>

<p>A moment later she had wound herself out of my arms, and with the
words, "Remember your promise," had disappeared into the room. The
noise ceased as she entered, and as the door closedeverything was still
and solitude came about me; but my heart was glad as I went down the
stairs, and out into the night. It was dark now and snowing heavily;
but what did I care for the darkness and cold; I was in Paradise warmed
and lighted and gladdened with hope.</p>

<p>For some time after this meeting I was content and happy; Sonia's
warmth to me and her promise to see me again, brightened life for me;
but as the days grew to weeks, and the weeks to months, I became
despondent. I never fell into the utter misery that possessed me
before; I had one consolation now that I had previously lacked&mdash;I
wrote to her regularly. True, she did not answer me; but I knew that my
letters would be a tie between us and so I kept them up. As the weeks
grew into months, however, my letters, I am afraid, became rarer.</p>

<p>I noticed now that there were all sorts of rumours of Nihilist
conspiracies flying about, but they had little or no effect on the
gaieties of the capital, and I paid little heed to them. I read a good
deal in the winter evenings, and went a good deal to the theatre. I was
amused by the love of dancing shown by this northern people; the
ballets in the theatre often lasted the whole evening, and there were
sometimes as many as three or four hundred dancers together on the
stage. Russia is the only country in Europe in which dancing is still
regarded as one of the fine arts. But after all the reading of the
modern Russian writers, Tolstoi, Dostoievsky, and Turgenieff, was my
chief occupation and pleasure.</p>

<p>One evening, I remember, I had got hold of Tolstoi's "Cossacks," or
rather the story had got hold of me. The wish to finish it kept me up
late, and I had only closed the book a few moments when a knock came at
my door. I called out, and to my astonishment the night porter came in,
saying:</p>

<p>"There's a lady for you, sir."</p>

<p>"A lady," I repeated, utterly bewildered. "I don't know any lady.
You must be making a mistake."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, he's not," said a voice I knew well, and Sonia passed him
and came into the room. There she stood in a great white fur wrap that
hid everything except her face. I could not realise it; it was too
sudden; I was hardly able to believe my eyes.</p>

<p>She put the hood from off her head, and taking the great fur in both
hands threw it backwards from her on a chair: she was in ball
dress.</p>

<p>"Have you no welcome for me?" she asked, holding out both her hands.
The old familiar gesture brought me to myself and gave me words.</p>

<p>"Welcome!" I said, and took her cold hands in mine and pressed them
against my heart, "Welcome!" She smiled as if pleased with my emotion
and I went on, "I never knew before, Sonia, why jewellers make their
boxes so uncouth and shapeless outside; it is to show off the exquisite
beauty of the jewel within; and so with you, you witch! that uncouth
great wrap sets off your loveliness!"</p>

<p>And indeed at the moment I was overpoweredwith the sense of her
physical seduction. The charm of it came over me as a perfume sometimes
comes, with such excess of sweetness that it makes one giddy. I could
feel my mouth parching as I looked at her.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought occurred to me&mdash;a poisonous thought.</p>

<p>"But this is not the meeting you promised me, is it?" I asked, and I
held her from me in sudden dread.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," she replied, "the only one I could give you without
hurting you."</p>

<p>"Hurting me!" I repeated bitterly, all the disappointment of my long
solitude welling up in me. "You think a great deal of my suffering,
don't you? when a letter from you&mdash;three careless
lines&mdash;would have made me so happy that angels would have envied
me, and yet you kept silent and sent me not a word&mdash;seventeen
weeks and not one little word!"</p>

<p>"Also for fear of hurting you," and the great eyes forced me to
believe her though I didn't see how it could be true. "But I have come
now and I want to tell you how good your letters were to me, how sweet
they were, the only sweet things in my life since I last saw you."</p>

<p>But the fear of her going away was upon me and prevented me giving
myself up to the happiness.</p>

<p>"But now," I said, "you will have to go. Your carriage is waiting,
of course; it would compromise you if you stayed more than a few
moments in a hotel at this time of night."</p>

<p>She drew her hands from me and walked to the fire before she
spoke.</p>

<p>"I am cold," she began in a thin toneless voice, "and you make it
colder with your little rags of convention. Sometimes I think of you as
going about in your baby-clothes. Can you never get rid of them
altogether?" and she turned to me with the old imperious accent in her
voice. "What do you think I care about compromising myself?" and she
laughed. "If you only knew how compromised I am already, you would see
that this visit if it ever gets out, instead of blackening me, will
shine white against my robe of darkness and death."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked in fear, taking her hands; for she was
too sincere to be theatrical.</p>

<p>"Mean," she repeated in the same strained tone. "I mean that I have
come to see you, my lover&mdash;so you sign yourself, don't you
?&mdash;to see you for perhaps the last time&mdash;alone at
midnight&mdash;and you meet me with coldness and tell me I must not
compromise myself."</p>

<p>"You don't know what you are saying," I answered; but I interpreted
what she said as a challenge and my fevered blood rushed over will and
sense. I took her in my arms and drew her to me and covered her face
and neck with kisses. A moment afterwards she was holding me from her
breathless:</p>

<p>"Be reasonable, be reasonable," she said with a smile, and sat down
in the low chair.</p>

<p>"Reasonable," I said, throwing myself on my knees beside her and
putting my arms round herwaist. "How do you think I can be reasonable
when you tell me that you have come to your lover for perhaps the last
time and find him cold. That is not true, Sonia, that is not true. My
kisses are still on your neck. Say that it is not true.</p>

<p>"Do you know," I went on, "that I have never seen you before in a
low dress? How exquisite you are! Like some strange lily with the white
leaves turned back," and I put my lips again on the smooth veined
flesh. A moment, and her cool skin fired my blood, and my heart shook
me with its beating: "Cold!" I repeated. "Am I cold?"</p>

<p>She lifted my head from her neck, saying, "No, love,"
beseechingly.</p>

<p>"But how can you call me 'love,'" I said, "and speak of the 'last
time'?" and again I drew her to me.</p>

<p>"'Perhaps the last time,'" she corrected me, flushing and still
holding my head from her.</p>

<p>"That's the same thing," I said roughly, with a sort of physical
exasperation at her restraint. "What do you mean? If you don't explain
it or take it back, I will keep you here always and it will indeed be
the last time that you will plague me with absence," and I began to
caress the restraining arms with my lips.</p>

<p>"Ah," she cried, "be reasonable, George, be reasonable. If you only
knew, the fear that you might think worse of me for coming made it
difficult to come."</p>

<p>"How could you?" I interrupted; but she shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I could," she replied. "You showed me that in Vienna when
I took you to that private room; I saw it in your face, and it hurt me,
hurt me. It is always hurting me."</p>

<p>"Forgive me," I cried, overcome with shame and remorse, "forgive me,
Sonia! Really I put it out of my mind; it had no effect on me; I never
harboured it. One only learns such a nature as yours little by little;
forgive me, sweet!"</p>

<p>Even as I spoke I struggled for self-possession and the power to
think, and with this same purpose I added:</p>

<p>"But won't your carriage be waiting? Hadn't I better send it
home?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I came in a droshky. I will go back in it when you
are tired of me."</p>

<p>"Tired of you," I repeated, "that will never be. But why do you
provoke me," I went on wildly, "when I am half mad and unable to think?
Your beauty intoxicates me. Don't you know that I have longed for you
and dreamed of you for months? Why do you talk of my being
'tired'?"</p>

<p>"Why," she repeated, "why? That's hard to tell unless you knew all
that I know. But do you think it has cost me nothing to keep away from
you all these months? All the time I have lived for others and crushed
my own heart. Is that nothing? Now I come and let my heart speak for
the moment; is that wonderful?" She clasped her hands and went on as if
she had caught theclue.</p>

<p>"Is it wonderful," she repeated, starting up, "that one finds it
hard to die before one has lived? wonderful that one who gives
everything should want to keep one moment for the man she loves?
wonderful that one cannot be resolute all through but must be a woman
at the last?"</p>

<p>"At the last," I said, as if waking suddenly to something strange
and strained in her. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me," she replied, still in the same tone of exaltation.
"I am mad to-night&mdash;or sane, for once&mdash;I don't know which or
care. One thing's sure; my life is mine now to do as I please with. At
last it is mine&mdash;or yours if you will."</p>

<p>Her voice played on my nerves like music.</p>

<p>"Do you remember telling me once," she went on, "that to rouse your
passion and not satisfy it, was unfair, for it drew out the worst in
you? I told you then that I would give you anything&mdash;everything,
if I were free.</p>

<p>"Now I am free&mdash;free as fire or air&mdash;and I come to
you."</p>

<p>She held out her hands to me, and in my poor brain came the thought,
the one thought, that the bond of the flesh would indeed be a bond
between us that she could never break, that so she would always return
to me and at last be mine. And I took her slowly in my arms and put my
lips to hers. . . .</p>

<p>An hour afterwards I was seated in the chair and she was in my arms,
and I noticed that her face was pale and thin, and the violet rings
about her eyes made my heart weep. I tried to comforther by telling her
how I would live in Petersburg always and make myself a Russian and do
whatever pleased her, and all these sentences I said in Russian
carefully to her; but she put her hand on my mouth with infinite
tenderness:</p>

<p>"No plans, dear, no plans, and no regrets. The past does not belong
to us any more, and the future may never be ours. It is this moment
that we own, and it consoles me for everything to feel your arms about
me and to know that you are happy. You are, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"More than happy," I said, "if to-day is the beginning of a new life
for us, if you will be my wife and give yourself to me for ever."</p>

<p>"'For ever,'" she repeated, in a tone drenched with emotion, "our
'for ever' is but a moment, and yet it repays me for all I have
suffered and for all I may suffer still," and she put her hand through
my hair in a caress.</p>

<p>What could I say? Her words brought tears of joy to my eyes, and yet
made me feel divinely humble. I lifted her from me and slipped down
beside her on my knees with my arms still about her&mdash;that was my
place I felt&mdash;and then I drew down her eyes and kissed them again
and again, with my heart now, and not my lips alone.</p>

<p>And so we sat for a long time, speaking, I think, but little, and
yet getting to know each other more and more intimately with the
mysterious divination of love.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a sound in the hotel: the night was gone; some
one on my floor was being%%253%%called for an early train, and as soon
as she heard the noise Sonia started to her feet:</p>

<p>"I must go!"</p>

<p>"Go!" I said, "but let me go with you; I must see you home."</p>

<p>"No, no!" she cried, "you must not;" but I persisted.</p>

<p>"Why not, Sonia?"</p>

<p>She turned to me with her whole face shaken and her eyes brimming
over. The sadness in her face was despairing.</p>

<p>"You must not question me, dear one; I have no explanations to give.
I only want you to know one thing, to put it in your soul, as it is in
mine&mdash;that I owe you all the sweetness of my life."</p>

<p>She put her arms about my neck, and in her eyes . . . there was the
love that is stronger than death. I took her down to the door of the
hotel. As soon as the door opened on the dull gray morning a droshky
that had evidently been on the look out, whirled up and in a moment she
had gone and I was alone.</p>

<p>The next two or three days passed in a dream with me. I wrote to
Sonia in the morning saying that I would have to see her again at once,
that I could not live without her, and that I was determined to share
her fate, whatever it might be. I added that if I did not hear from
her, I should seek her till I found her. The afternoon of the same day
brought me a note. The porter told me that an isvostchik had left it
and gone away at once. It was from Sonia and just like her; here it
is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pbq">"Dear Heart,</p>

<p class="pbq">"You must not see me. I do not wish it. You shall hear
from me soon.</p>

<p class="pbq">Yours till death,</p>

<p class="pbq">"SONIA."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two or three days later I came down to lunch rather late. I had been
conscious for a little while that there was an unusual hurrying and
scurrying about in the hotel, but I was so wrapped up in my own
feelings and hopes that I paid little attention to it all. When I got
down to the restaurant, I found everything in confusion. Waiters came
into the room and went out again quickly, and though, strange to say,
there was no one but myself to serve, they did not attend to me. Three
several times I gave my order and the waiter took it, went away and
never came back. At last I got up, caught a half-scared waiter by the
ear, and said to him in Russian:</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Have you all lost your wits?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," he replied, "but the Tsar is dead, they say."</p>

<p>"What, man?" I cried, "what do you mean?"</p>

<p>It was true. The head-waiter came in, and in a moment told me the
whole tragedy&mdash;the Tsar had been out driving; on his way back to
the Winter Palace bombs had been thrown which had blown his horses and
himself to pieces.</p>

<p>"And the throwers?" I asked.</p>

<p>His eyebrows went up. "The police have one,"he said, "and they are
searching. They say it is the Nihilists. . . ."</p>

<p>Half an hour afterwards, a note was brought to me from Green, asking
me to come to the Embassy at once. I went, and found him in a state of
consternation; and yet he could not help saying what everyone was
saying, "the greatest crime of the century." Green was sure to make his
way in diplomacy&mdash;his thoughts kept the common road: everyone
would be pleased with him.</p>

<p>"It is terrible," I said, "but what has it all to do with me?"</p>

<p>"Much," he replied quickly. "Some time ago the police came here to
find out about you, to find out if you were favourably known to us. Of
course, we told them that you were all right; but they came back a
couple of days ago and said"&mdash;he began turning over some papers
till at last he found a slip on which some memoranda were
scribbled&mdash;"that you were known to be in communication with
Nihilists, notably with a Jewess, one Helfmann, and that you should be
warned." He threw down the paper and went on. "The moment I got the
news of this tragedy, I sent for you to tell you. I think you had
better take this despatch box and go to Berlin with it at once as one
of our messengers."</p>

<p>"Not I," I replied. "I have done nothing wrong."</p>

<p>"Mere suspicion now," he said, "would put you in prison for a year,
and we could not help you. Believe me, you must go. I cannot tell you
all my reasons, but you must leave Petersburg to-night."</p>

<p>His insistence was so peculiar, so menacing, that I told him at last
I would take his advice; and I did.</p>

<p>But first I wrote to Sonia and told her what had befallen me and
gave her my address, begging her to write. I left Petersburg that
evening, and I left it not a moment too soon. The next day it would
have been impossible to leave without a special permit countersigned by
the chief of police; and he would never have given it to me.</p>

<p>That was an exciting time in Berlin, and, I suppose, all over the
civilized world. Men talked of nothing and read of nothing but the
great tragedy, and every detail that came to hand only increased the
public interest. Everyone felt that this crime was like no other crime;
it was not the deed of one or two monomaniacs; there were dozens
implicated in it, and in spite of numberless spies and detectives, a
whole government organized for defence, nothing had been suspected,
nothing had leaked out. Yet one day we read that had the Tsar returned
to his palace by another route, the whole street would have gone into
the air with him&mdash;the whole of Garden Street had been undermined
from side to side and turned into a huge magazine. A little later we
heard that the assassins were all volunteers&mdash;the picked and
chosen out of forty-seven who had offered themselves for the work; and
a little later still came the news that two days before the
assassination, three of the murderers had actually rehearsed the crime.
They had dared to go through the police-crowded streets of Petersburg
to a piece of waste land on theoutskirts of the town and there throw
one of the five-inch tin bombs in order to study what its effect would
be. The imagination was palsied by such facts.</p>

<p>The later conduct of these conspirators was no less extraordinary.
One hundred and fifty accused and not a single informer! Not a single
person who tried to save his own life at the expense of his fellows!
And everyone knew enough of the methods of Russian prisons to know that
neither punishment nor reward was spared to win betrayal and make
conviction sure. Scenes to shake the soul; on the one side
mind-torture, planned and perfect; on the other, silence.</p>

<p>"You met so-and-so at such-and-such a place?" questioned the
magistrate. "We know it. You were dressed as a workman; he was dressed
as an artisan. You see we know everything. Admit it and you shall go
free."</p>

<p>A smile was the answer. The most astonishing thing was that these
criminals would tell of themselves freely; they seemed indeed to court
death but not a word to hurt their fellows.</p>

<p>And so by these individual confessions little by little we came to
the heart of the matter and learned that it was a woman, a mere girl,
who had been the soul of the conspiracy; the master-spirit who drew the
others to her and inflamed them with her own white heat of purpose; and
bit by bit we were enabled to reconstruct the last scene.</p>

<p>The place was the bridge leading over the Catherine Canal. On the
rise of the bridge itself as on a platform whence she could see and be
seen,the girl took her stand; below her were her three assistants,
Risakoff, Elnikoff, and another. The girl was to wave her pocket
handkerchief, as the death signal.</p>

<p>Suddenly the horses and the closed carriage surrounded by its escort
of Cossacks, appeared whirling towards the bridge. The handkerchief
fluttered, and at once Risakoff threw his bomb. It smashed the hinder
part of the carriage and killed a Cossack and a moujik who happened to
be standing near. The hind wheels being blown away, the carriage fell
and stopped the horses. A moment after, the Tsar opened the door and
stepped out unhurt. Seeing the Cossack and the moujik lying in their
blood on the ground, he was overpowered by the sense of his own escape
and cried, "Thank God."</p>

<p>At this moment, Risakoff, who had been seized by some of the
bystanders, was heard to say: "It is too soon to thank God yet." The
same instant the handkerchief fluttered again, and Elnikoff rushed
forward, lifted his hands high above his head and hurled his bomb down
between himself and the Emperor. He was blown to pieces; the Tsar's
limbs were shattered. The awful sight turned the third murderer to
pity; he shoved his bomb into his pocket and helped to lift the dying
monarch into a sledge. Oh wonderful heart of man that includes in
itself all contradictions! In one moment this assassin became a nurse
at the risk of his life. Meanwhile the girl, seeing her work was done,
walked on over the bridge and disappeared among the crowd&mdash;to
giveherself up three days afterwards in the Nevski Prospekt.</p>

<p>As I read all this, the blood ebbed from my heart and left me
gasping. The simplicity of the signal, the deadly resolution, filled me
with a fear which I did not dare to put into words. I was relieved when
I read later that the girl-chief was supposed to be the mistress of the
peasant Jelaboff, and that her name was Lydia Voinoff.</p>

<p>But a day or two later still we heard that she was not the only
woman implicated, that there were two women among the six who were put
on their trial for murder before the High Court of the Senate, and that
the second woman was a Jewess, one Hetty Helfmann. With that name a
weight of fear came on me, crushing me, and I was afraid to think; yet
without conscious thinking my fear took form and went with me
everywhere.</p>

<p>I scarcely dared to go out. I was waiting for news&mdash;"news,"
that horrible word&mdash;in my room, when the door opened and a man
came in without ceremony of any kind.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" I asked in astonishment. He took off his rough
cap as he answered: "You don't remember me!"</p>

<p>It was Michailoff.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, conscious of hate and anger; "I remember you
perfectly." And I did. I could see the bare room and the wisps of smoke
blown through it and the crowd of men, and Sonia standing with her back
to me&mdash;I remembered everything, even to the dirt the men's boots
had brought into the room and left on the bare boards.</p>

<p>But the man had altered. This was not the smiling face and the
little moustache with its handsome upward curl. He had shaved moustache
and beard: the eyes were different too; they were without light or
steadiness. What was it that made me avoid them? Was the man mad? He
seemed to resent either my manner or my scrutiny; but he came forward
without speaking and threw himself heavily into a chair.</p>

<p>"I am done," he said, "I have not eaten for days nor slept for a
week. Give me food and drink."</p>

<p>The remains of my lunch were on the table. As I went to the bell he
stopped me.</p>

<p>"Don't ring," he said. "This will do;" and he turned and began to
eat, while I poured out wine for him.</p>

<p>When he had finished, he took up a cigarette; then leaned back in
the chair and began to smoke.</p>

<p>"Do you know?" he began quietly, "I meant to kill you, once. How
silly it all seems now, how unreal! I have come from Petersburg to see
you; to hear you speak; to find out what it is that made such a woman
love you! You are tall and strong and clean; but that's all I can
see&mdash;and that's not enough."</p>

<p>"Did you come here to tell me that?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"No," he replied quietly, "no, I came here as a messenger to answer
whatever you had to ask and to give you a letter."</p>

<p>"Give it me," I said, holding out my hand; and after a moment of
what I took to be hesitation hehanded me a letter. It was from Sonia. I
opened it and read the first line at a glance:</p>

<p>"When you get this, I shall be dead, my lover."</p>

<p>I stood with the letter in my hand and felt my heart stop.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" My voice startled me, it was so small and
thin.</p>

<p>"Mean," he answered, "it means that you were loved by the greatest
woman in the world&mdash;you! It means that she adored you&mdash;she
whom we all worshipped and now she is dead&mdash;Sophia
Perovskaia."</p>

<p>Then it was true; I was not surprised; I seemed to have known it
always; but I could not think.</p>

<p>"Ah, the sacred name!" he went on, "the sacred name!"</p>

<p>"Tell me about her," I interrupted him. "Tell me about it. What did
she do?"</p>

<p>"Do," he said, "do. Good God! he did not even know her."</p>

<p>"What did she do?" he cried after a pause. "I will tell you. She was
the soul of our movement; she foresaw everything; organized everything;
and at the last, directed everything. Ah, she chose her instruments
well."</p>

<p>My whole being woke to hate of him and his theatrical speech.</p>

<p>"And you?" I said. "She chose you as a messenger!" and I
laughed.</p>

<p>He dropped into the chair and put his face in his hands.</p>

<p>"No," he said, after a pause; "she sent me out of Petersburg at the
critical time, persuadingme that my brain and tongue alone could do
some work in Moscow that had to be done, and so I escaped the police;
but when I came back, and I came back as soon as I heard the news, it
was too late to do anything for her or the others. I found she had left
a letter for you; no one seemed to know you, so I took it and followed
you here. I don't know why now&mdash;with some wish, I think, to hurt
you. But I have no such wish now. I can think of nothing but
her&mdash;and you're right, she despised me!"</p>

<p>"Tell me of her," I heard myself saying.</p>

<p>"Have you heard of the end?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," I said in rage; "how could I have heard?"</p>

<p>"That's true," he said. "I have come straight through," and he began
hurriedly, as if he liked to tell of it, and his rhetoric hardly ever
left him.</p>

<p>"It was awful and beautiful too. There were crowds and crowds of
people; the ten thousand soldiers were but a thin wall to keep the
ocean of people back. There was the black scaffold&mdash;two poles and
a crossbar and five rings with dangling halters. We waited for hours.
The snow and ice on the plain had melted under the hot sun, and been
churned to mud by the myriad feet. One shivered and burned in
turns.</p>

<p>"Suddenly we saw the two tumbrils, high upon the first Risakoff and
Jelaboff, and in the next the other three, Sonia in the middle-the one
divine thing in the world, with her smiling pale face and God-illumined
eyes!</p>

<p>"All of them in black&mdash;black robes, black caps;great placards
on their breasts, 'Murderers of the Tsar!' The good Tsar," he added
bitterly, "the Tsar who cried 'Thank God,' when he saw his Cossacks and
moujiks lying dead and thought he had escaped!</p>

<p>"When they unbound them on the platform I could see her walk about
cheering each of them, kissing them, encouraging them, but no one could
hear what she said for the noise of the drums. Yet her courage lifted
the soul and made the place sacred! Then one after the other they
mounted the stool, . . . I see her hanging still! . . . As I came away
everyone was crying, the soldiers and the people alike&mdash;everyone.
And now," he added, "I am worse than dead. There is nothing for me to
hope for in the world&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>He rose and left the room, and I let him go, for I wanted to be
alone with my love and her last words to me. Here is her letter:</p>

<p>"When you get this I shall be dead, my lover. Dead, the word looks
strange; and yet all it means is simply rest and sleep, and I am tired,
tired and worse than tired.</p>

<p>"Ever since I left you, I have been in doubt, wondering always
whether it would not be better to leave the work undone and just go
back and lie in your arms again and feel your kisses on my face.</p>

<p>"It was not only the temptation of your love that tortured me, but
fear, too&mdash;an awful fear! Do you remember once saying to me that
ideas were better than deeds, that deeds had always some of the dirt of
the world on them? How true thatis! and how terrible! Since I left you
I have been in the dirt and I shall never be clean again; though my
heart loathes it; but still the thing had to be done and that must be
enough for me.</p>

<p>"I could not do anything else, dear. I was not made to do anything
else; I could not have lived a great life; the slow hours would have
broken me. I see that now clearly.</p>

<p>"I want to say one thing to you before I go, love; one thing that is
sure where everything else breaks and changes.</p>

<p>"You always compared society to a pyramid, do you remember? and said
that the base of it must rest in the mud. It isn't true, dear; we will
lift the pyramid by putting our own breasts under it. It may crush us,
but others will follow the example&mdash;that is sure!</p>

<p>"You will not increase the weight of the pyramid for us; but lighten
it and help to lift it, my lover.</p>

<p>"And now, dear. . . ."</p>

<p>But I can copy no more; the rest of the letter belongs to me alone,
for the loss is mine.</p>
