<h2><a id="chap1" name="chap1">1. THE SCHOLAR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">At the age of six Randall Byrne could name and
bound every state in the Union and give the date of its admission;
at nine he was conversant with Homeric Greek and Caesar; at twelve
he read Aristophanes with perfect understanding of the allusions of
the day and divided his leisure between Ovid and Horace; at
fifteen, wearied by the simplicity of Old English and Thirteenth
Century Italian, he dipped into the history of Philosophy and
passed from that, naturally, into calculus and the higher
mathematics; at eighteen he took an A.B. from Harvard and while
idling away a pleasant summer with Hebrew and Sanskrit, he delved
lightly into biology and its kindred sciences, having reached the
conclusion that Truth is greater than Goodness or Beauty, because
it comprises both, and the whole is greater than any of its parts;
at twenty-one he pocketed his Ph.D. and was touched with the fever
of his first practical enthusiasm&mdash;surgery. At twenty-four he
was an M.D. and a distinguished diagnostician, though he preferred
work in his laboratory in his endeavor to resolve the elements into
simpler forms; also he published at this time a work on
anthropology whose circulation was limited to two hundred copies,
and he received in return two hundred letters of congratulation
from great men who had tried to read his book; at twenty-seven he
collapsed one fine spring day on the floor of his laboratory. That
afternoon he was carried into the presence of a great physician who
was also a very vulgar man. The great physician felt his pulse and
looked into his dim eyes.</p>

<p>"You have a hundred and twenty horsepower brain and a runabout
body," said the great physician.</p>

<p>"I have come," answered Randall Byrne faintly, "for the solution
of a problem, not for the statement thereof."</p>

<p>"I'm not through," said the great physician. "Among other things
you are a damned fool."</p>

<p>Randall Byrne here rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>"What steps do you suggest that I consider?" he queried.</p>

<p>The great physician spat noisily.</p>

<p>"Marry a farmer's daughter," he said brutally.</p>

<p>"But," said Randall Byrne vaguely.</p>

<p>"I am a busy man and you've wasted ten minutes of my time," said
the great physician, turning back to his plate glass window. "My
secretary will send you a bill for one thousand dollars.
Good-day."</p>

<p>And therefore, ten days later, Randall Byrne sat in his room in
the hotel at Elkhead.</p>

<p>He had just written (to his friend Swinnerton Loughburne, M.A.,
Ph.D., L.L.D.):</p>

<p class="letter">"Incontrovertibly the introduction of the
personal equation leads to lamentable inversions, and the
perceptive faculties when contemplating phenomena through the lens
of ego too often conceive an accidental connotation or manifest
distortion to be actuality, for the physical (or personal) too
often beclouds that power of inner vision which so unerringly
penetrates to the inherent truths of incorporeity and the
extramundane. Yet this problem, to your eyes, I fear, not
essentially novel or peculiarly involute, holds for my
contemplative faculties an extraordinary fascination, to wit:
wherein does the mind, in itself a muscle, escape from the laws of
the physical, and wherein and wherefore do the laws of the physical
exercise so inexorable a jurisdiction over the processes of the
mind, so that a disorder of the visual nerve actually distorts the
asomatous and veils the pneumatoscopic?<br>
<br>
"Your pardon, dear Loughburne, for these lapses from the general to
the particular, but in a lighter moment of idleness, I pray you
give some careless thought to a problem now painfully my own,
though rooted inevitably so deeply in the dirt of the
commonplace.<br>
<br>
"But you have asked me in letter of recent date for the particular
physical aspects of my present environment, and though (as you so
well know) it is my conviction that the physical fact is not and
only the immaterial is, yet I shall gladly look about me&mdash;a
thing I have not yet seen occasion to do&mdash;and describe to you
the details of my present condition."</p>

<p>Accordingly, at this point Randall Byrne removed from his nose
his thick glasses and holding them poised he stared through the
window at the view without. He had quite changed his appearance by
removing the spectacles, for the owlish touch was gone and he
seemed at a stroke ten years younger. It was such a face as one is
glad to examine in detail, lean, pale, the transparent skin
stretched tightly over cheekbones, nose, and chin. That chin was
built on good fighting lines, though somewhat over-delicate in
substance and the mouth quite colourless, but oddly enough the
upper lip had that habitual appearance of stiff compression which
is characteristic of highly strung temperaments; it is a noticeable
feature of nearly every great actor, for instance. The nose was
straight and very thin and in a strong sidelight a tracery of the
red blood showed through at the nostrils. The eyes were deeply
buried and the lower lids bruised with purple&mdash;weak eyes that
blinked at a change of light or a sudden thought&mdash;distant eyes
which missed the design of wall paper and saw the trees growing on
the mountains. The forehead was Byrne's most noticeable feature,
pyramidal, swelling largely towards the top and divided in the
centre into two distinct lobes by a single marked furrow which gave
his expression a hint of the wistful. Looking at that forehead one
was strangely conscious of the brain beneath. There seemed no bony
structure; the mind, undefended, was growing and pushing the
confining walls further out.</p>

<p>And the fragility which the head suggested the body confirmed,
for he was not framed to labor. The burden of the noble head had
bowed the slender throat and crooked the shoulders, and when he
moved his arm it seemed the arm of a skeleton too loosely clad.
There was a differing connotation in the hands, to be sure. They
were thin&mdash;bones and sinews chiefly, with the violet of the
veins showing along the backs; but they were active hands without
tremor&mdash;hands ideal for the accurate scalpel, where a
fractional error means death to the helpless.</p>

<p>After a moment of staring through the window the scholar wrote
again: "The major portion of Elkhead lies within plain sight of my
window. I see a general merchandise store, twenty-seven buildings
of a comparatively major and eleven of a minor significance, and
five saloons. The streets&mdash;"</p>

<p>The streets, however, were not described at that sitting, for at
this juncture a heavy hand knocked and the door of Randall Byrne's
room was flung open by Hank Dwight, proprietor of Elkhead's
saloon&mdash;a versatile man, expert behind the bar or in a
blacksmith shop.</p>

<p>"Doc," said Hank Dwight, "you're wanted." Randall Byrne placed
his spectacles more firmly on his nose to consider his host.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;" he began, but Hank Dwight had already turned on
his heel.</p>

<p>"Her name is Kate Cumberland. A little speed, doc. She's in a
hurry."</p>

<p>"If no other physician is available," protested Byrne, following
slowly down the stairs, "I suppose I must see her."</p>

<p>"If they was another within ten miles, d'you s'pose I'd call on
you?" asked Hank Dwight.</p>

<p>So saying, he led the way out onto the veranda, where the doctor
was aware of a girl in a short riding skirt who stood with one
gloved hand on her hip while the other slapped a quirt idly against
her riding boots.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap2" name="chap2">2. WORDS AND BULLETS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"Here's a gent that calls himself a doc," said
Hank Dwight by way of an introduction. "If you can use him, Miss
Cumberland, fly to it!"</p>

<p>And he left them alone.</p>

<p>Now the sun lay directly behind Kate Cumberland and in order to
look at her closely the doctor had to shade his weak eyes and
pucker his brows; for from beneath her wide sombrero there rolled a
cloud of golden hair as bright as the sunshine itself&mdash;a sad
strain upon the visual nerve of Doctor Randall Byrne. He repeated
her name, bowed, and when he straightened, blinked again. As if she
appreciated that strain upon his eyes she stepped closer, and
entered the shadow.</p>

<p>"Doctor Hardin is not in town," she said, "and I have to bring a
physician out to the ranch at once; my father is critically
ill."</p>

<p>Randall Byrne rubbed his lean chin.</p>

<p>"I am not practicing at present," he said reluctantly. Then he
saw that she was watching him closely, weighing him with her eyes,
and it came to the mind of Randall Byrne that he was not a large
man and might not incline the scale far from the horizontal.</p>

<p>"I am hardly equipped&mdash;" began Byrne.</p>

<p>"You will not need equipment," she interrupted. "His trouble
lies in his nerves and the state of his mind."</p>

<p>A slight gleam lighted the eyes of the doctor.</p>

<p>"Ah," he murmured. "The mind?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He rubbed his bloodless hands slowly together, and when he spoke
his voice was sharp and quick and wholly impersonal. "Tell me the
symptoms!"</p>

<p>"Can't we talk those over on the way to the ranch? Even if we
start now it will be dark before we arrive."</p>

<p>"But," protested the doctor, "I have not yet decided&mdash;this
precipitancy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, and flushed. He perceived that she was on the
verge of turning away, but something withheld her. "There is no
other physician within reach; my father is very ill. I only ask
that you come as a diagnostician, doctor!"</p>

<p>"But a ride to your ranch," he said miserably. "I presume you
refer to riding a horse?"</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"I am unfamiliar with that means of locomotion," said the doctor
with serious eyes, "and in fact have not carried my acquaintance
with the equine species beyond a purely experimental stage.
Anatomically I have a superficial knowledge, but on the one
occasion on which I sat in a saddle I observed that the docility of
the horse is probably a poetic fallacy."</p>

<p>He rubbed his left shoulder thoughtfully and saw a slight tremor
at the corners of the girl's mouth. It caused his vision to clear
and concentrate; he found that the lips were, in fact, in the very
act of smiling. The face of the doctor brightened.</p>

<p>"You shall ride my own horse," said the girl. "She is perfectly
gentle and has a very easy gait. I'm sure you'll have not the
slightest trouble with her."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"I'll find something about town; it doesn't matter what."</p>

<p>"This," said the doctor, "is most remarkable. You choose your
mounts at random?"</p>

<p>"But you will go?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, the trip to the ranch!" groaned the doctor. "Let me
see: the physical obstacles to such a trip while many are not
altogether insuperable, I may say; in the meantime the moral urge
which compels me towards the ranch seems to be of the first order."
He sighed. "Is it not strange, Miss Cumberland, that man, though
distinguished from the lower orders by mind, so often is controlled
in his actions by ethical impulses which override the
considerations of reason? An observation which leads us towards the
conclusion that the passion for goodness is a principle hardly
secondary to the passion for truth. Understand that I build the
hypothesis only tentatively, with many reservations, among
which&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off short. The smile was growing upon her lips.</p>

<p>"I will put together a few of my things," said the doctor, "and
come down to you at once."</p>

<p>"Good!" said the girl, "I'll be waiting for you with two horses
before you are ready."</p>

<p>He turned away, but had taken hardly a step before he turned,
saying: "But why are you so sure that you will be ready before
I&mdash;" but she was already down the steps from the veranda and
stepping briskly down the street.</p>

<p>"There is an element of the unexplainable in woman," said the
doctor, and resumed his way to his room. Once there, something
prompted him to act with the greatest possible speed. He tossed his
toilet articles and a few changes of linen into a small, flexible
valise and ran down the stairs. He reached the veranda again,
panting, and the girl was not in sight; a smile of triumph appeared
on the grave, colourless lips of the doctor. "Feminine instinct,
however, is not infallible," he observed to himself, and to one of
the cowboys, lounging loosely in a chair nearby, he continued his
train of thoughts aloud: "Though the verity of the feminine
intuition has already been thrown in a shade of doubt by many
thinkers, as you will undoubtedly agree."</p>

<p>The man thus addressed allowed his lower jaw to drop but after a
moment he ejaculated: "Now what in hell d'you mean by that?"</p>

<p>The doctor already turned away, intent upon his thoughts, but he
now paused and again faced the cowboy. He said, frowning: "There is
unnecessary violence in your remark, sir."</p>

<p>"Duck your glasses," said the worthy in question. "You ain't
talkin' to a book, you're talking to a man."</p>

<p>"And in your attitude," went on the doctor, "there is an element
of offense which if carried farther might be corrected by physical
violence."</p>

<p>"I don't foller your words," said the cattleman, "but from the
drift of your tune I gather you're a bit peeved; and if you
are&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice had risen to a ringing note as he proceeded and he now
slipped from his chair and faced Randall Byrne, a big man, brown,
hard-handed. The doctor crimsoned.</p>

<p>"Well?" he echoed, but in place of a deep ring his words were
pitched in a high squeak of defiance.</p>

<p>He saw a large hand contract to a fist, but almost instantly the
big man grinned, and his eyes went past Byrne.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell!" he grunted, and turned his back with a chuckle.</p>

<p>For an instant there was a mad impulse in the doctor to spring
at this fellow but a wave of impotence overwhelmed him. He knew
that he was white around the mouth, and there was a dryness in his
throat.</p>

<p>"The excitement of imminent physical contest and personal
danger," he diagnosed swiftly, "causing acceleration of the pulse
and attendant weakness of the body&mdash;a state unworthy of the
balanced intellect."</p>

<p>Having brought back his poise by this quick interposition of
reason, he went his way down the long veranda. Against a pillar
leaned another tall cattleman, also brown and lean and hard.</p>

<p>"May I inquire," he said, "if you have any information direct or
casual concerning a family named Cumberland which possesses ranch
property in this vicinity?"</p>

<p>"You may," said the cowpuncher, and continued to roll his
cigarette.</p>

<p>"Well," said the doctor, "do you know anything about them?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said the other, and having finished his cigarette he
introduced it between his lips. It seemed to occur to him
instantly, however, that he was committing an inhospitable breach,
for he produced his Durham and brown papers with a start and
extended them towards the doctor.</p>

<p>"Smoke?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I use tobacco in no form," said the doctor.</p>

<p>The cowboy stared with such fixity that the match burned down to
his fingertips and singed them before he had lighted his
cigarette.</p>

<p>"'S that a fact?" he queried when his astonishment found
utterance. "What d'you do to kill time? Well, I been thinking about
knocking off the stuff for a while. Mame gets sore at me for having
my fingers all stained up with nicotine like this."</p>

<p>He extended his hand, the first and second fingers of which were
painted a bright yellow.</p>

<p>"Soap won't take it off," he remarked.</p>

<p>"A popular but inexcusable error," said the doctor. "It is the
tarry by-products of tobacco which cause that stain. Nicotine
itself, of course, is a volatile alkaloid base of which there is
only the merest trace in tobacco. It is one of the deadliest of
nerve poisons and is quite colourless. There is enough of that
stain upon your fingers&mdash;if it were nicotine&mdash;to kill a
dozen men."</p>

<p>"The hell you say!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, it is an indubitable fact. A lump of nicotine the
size of the head of a pin placed on the tongue of a horse will kill
the beast instantly."</p>

<p>The cowpuncher pushed back his hat and scratched his head.</p>

<p>"This is worth knowin'," he said, "but I'm some glad that Mame
ain't heard it."</p>

<p>"Concerning the Cumberlands," said the doctor, "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Concerning the Cumberlands," repeated the cattleman, "it's best
to leave 'em to their own concerns." And he started to turn away,
but the thirst for knowledge was dry in the throat of the
doctor.</p>

<p>"Do I understand," he insisted, "that there is some mystery
connected with them?"</p>

<p>"From me," replied the other, "you understand nothin'." And he
lumbered down the steps and away.</p>

<p>Be it understood that there was nothing of the gossip in Randall
Byrne, but now he was pardonably excited and perceiving the tall
form of Hank Dwight in the doorway he approached his host.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dwight," he said, "I am about to go to the Cumberland
ranch. I gather that there is something of an unusual nature
concerning them."</p>

<p>"There is," admitted Hank Dwight.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me what it is?"</p>

<p>"I can."</p>

<p>"Good!" said the doctor, and he almost smiled. "It is always
well to know the background of a case which has to do with mental
states. Now, just what do you know?"</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;" began the proprietor, and then paused and eyed
his guest dubiously. "I know," he continued, "a story."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, about a man and a hoss and a dog."</p>

<p>"The approach seems not quite obvious, but I shall be glad to
hear it."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Words," said the host, at length, "is worse'n bullets. You
never know what they'll hit."</p>

<p>"But the story?" persisted Randall Byrne.</p>

<p>"That story," said Hank Dwight, "I may tell to my son before I
die."</p>

<p>"This sounds quite promising."</p>

<p>"But I'll tell nobody else."</p>

<p>"Really!"</p>

<p>"It's about a man and a hoss and a dog. The man ain't possible,
the hoss ain't possible, the dog is a wolf."</p>

<p>He paused again and glowered on the doctor. He seemed to be
drawn two ways, by his eagerness to tell a yarn and his dread of
consequences.</p>

<p>"I know," he muttered, "because I've seen 'em all. I've
seen"&mdash;he looked far, as though striking a silent bargain with
himself concerning the sum of the story which might safely be
told&mdash;"I've seen a hoss that understood a man's talk like you
and me does&mdash;or better. I've heard a man whistle like a
singing bird. Yep, that ain't no lie. You jest imagine a bald eagle
that could lick anything between the earth and the sky and was able
to sing&mdash;that's what that whistlin' was like. It made you glad
to hear it, and it made you look to see if your gun was in good
workin' shape. It wasn't very loud, but it travelled pretty far,
like it was comin' from up above you."</p>

<p>"That's the way this strange man of the story whistles?" asked
Byrne, leaning closer.</p>

<p>"Man of the story?" echoed the proprietor, with some warmth.
"Friend, if he ain't real, then I'm a ghost. And they's them in
Elkhead that's got the scars of his comin' and goin'."</p>

<p>"Ah, an outlaw? A gunfighter?" queried the doctor.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, son," observed the host, and to make his point he
tapped the hollow chest of Byrne with a rigid forefinger, "around
these parts you know jest as much as you see, and lots of times you
don't even know that much. What you see is sometimes your business,
but mostly it ain't." He concluded impressively: "Words is worse'n
bullets!"</p>

<p>"Well," mused Byrne, "I can ask the girl these questions. It
will be medically necessary."</p>

<p>"Ask the girl? Ask her?" echoed the host with a sort of horror.
But he ended with a forced restraint: "That's <i>your</i>
business."</p>

<p class="first">Hank Dwight disappeared from the doorway and the
doctor was called from his pondering by the voice of the girl.
There was something about that voice which worried Byrne, for it
was low and controlled and musical and it did not fit with the
nasal harshness of the cattlemen. When she began to speak it was
like the beginning of a song. He turned now and found her sitting a
tall bay horse, and she led a red-roan mare beside her. When he
went out she tossed her reins over the head of her horse and
strapped his valise behind her saddle.</p>

<p>"You won't have any trouble with that mare," she assured him,
when the time came for mounting. Yet when he approached gingerly he
was received with flattened ears and a snort of anger. "Wait," she
cried, "the left side, not the right!"</p>

<p>He felt the laughter in her voice, but when he looked he could
see no trace of it in her face. He approached from the left side,
setting his teeth.</p>

<p>"You observe," he said, "that I take your word at its full
value," and placing his foot in the stirrup, he dragged himself
gingerly up to the saddle. The mare stood like a rock. Adjusting
himself, he wiped a sudden perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<p>"I quite believe," he remarked, "that the animal is of unusual
intelligence. All may yet be well!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it." said the girl gravely. "Now we're off."</p>

<p>And the horses broke into a dog trot. Now the gait of the red
roan mare was a dream of softness, and her flexible ankles gave a
play of whole inches to break the jar of every step, the sure sign
of the good saddle-horse; but the horse has never been saddled
whose trot is really a smooth pace. The hat of Doctor Byrne began
to incline towards his right eye and his spectacles towards his
left ear. He felt a peculiar lightness in the stomach and heaviness
in the heart.</p>

<p>"The t-t-t-trot," he ventured to his companion, "is a
d-d-d-dam&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dr. Byrne!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Whoa!" called Doctor Byrne, and drew mightily in upon the
reins. The red mare stopped as a ball stops when it meets a stout
wall; the doctor sprawled along her neck, clinging with arms and
legs. He managed to clamber back into the saddle.</p>

<p>"There are vicious elements in the nature of this brute," he
observed to the girl.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry," she murmured. He cast a sidelong glance but
found not the trace of a smile.</p>

<p>"The word upon which I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stopped?" she suggested.</p>

<p>"Stopped," he agreed, "was not, as you evidently assumed, an
oath. On the contrary, I was merely remarking that the trot is a
damaging gait, but through an
interrupted&mdash;er&mdash;articulation&mdash;"</p>

<p>His eye dared her, but she was utterly grave. He perceived that
there was, after all, a certain kinship between this woman of the
mountain-desert and the man thereof. Their silences were filled
with eloquence.</p>

<p>"We'll try a canter," she suggested, "and I think you'll find
that easier."</p>

<p>So she gave the word, and her bay sprang into a lope from a
standing start. The red mare did likewise, nearly flinging the
doctor over the back of the saddle, but by the grace of God he
clutched the pommel in time and was saved. The air caught at his
face, they swept out of the town and onto a limitless level
stretch.</p>

<p>"Sp-p-p-peed," gasped the doctor, "has never been a p-p-passion
with me!"</p>

<p>He noted that she was not moving in the saddle. The horse was
like the bottom of a wave swinging violently back and forth. She
was the calm crest, swaying slightly and graciously with a motion
as smooth as the flowing of water. And she spoke as evenly as if
she were sitting in a rocking chair.</p>

<p>"You'll be used to it in a moment," she assured him.</p>

<p>He learned, indeed, that if one pressed the stirrups as the
shoulders of the horse swung down and leaned a trifle forward when
the shoulders rose again, the motion ceased to be jarring; for she
was truly a matchless creature and gaited like one of those
fabulous horses of old, sired by the swift western wind. In a
little time a certain pride went beating through the veins of the
doctor, the air blew more deeply into his lungs, there was a
different tang to the wind and a different feel to the sun&mdash;a
peculiar richness of yellow warmth. And the small head of the horse
and the short, sharp, pricking ears tossed continually; and now and
then the mare threw her head a bit to one side and glanced back at
him with what he felt to be a reassuring air. Life and strength and
speed were gripped between his knees&mdash;he flashed a glance at
the girl.</p>

<p>But she rode with face straightforward and there was that about
her which made him turn his eyes suddenly away and look far off. It
was a jagged country, for in the brief rainy season there came
sudden and terrific downpours which lashed away the soil and
scoured the face of the underlying rock, and in a single day might
cut a deep arroyo where before had been smooth plain. This was the
season of grass, but not the dark, rank green of rich soil and mild
air&mdash;it was a yellowish green, a colour at once tender and
glowing. It spread everywhere across the plains about Elkhead,
broken here and there by the projecting boulders which flashed in
the sun. So a great battlefield might appear, pockmarked with
shell-holes, and all the scars of war freshly cut upon its face.
And in truth the mountain desert was like an arena ready to stage a
conflict&mdash;a titanic arena with space for earth-giants to
struggle&mdash;and there in the distance were the spectator
mountains. High, lean-flanked mountains they were, not clad in
forests, but rather bristling with a stubby growth of the few trees
which might endure in precarious soil and bitter weather, but now
they gathered the dignity of distance about them. The grass of the
foothills was a faint green mist about their feet, cloaks of
exquisite blue hung around the upper masses, but their heads were
naked to the pale skies. And all day long, with deliberate
alteration, the garb of the mountains changed. When the sudden
morning came they leaped naked upon the eye, and then withdrew,
muffling themselves in browns and blues until at nightfall they
covered themselves to the eyes in thickly sheeted
purple&mdash;Tyrian purple&mdash;and prepared for sleep with their
heads among the stars.</p>

<p>Something of all this came to Doctor Randall Byrne as he rode,
for it seemed to him that there was a similarity between these
mountains and the girl beside him. She held that keen purity of the
upper slopes under the sun, and though she had no artifice or
careful wiles to make her strange, there was about her a natural
dignity like the mystery of distance. There was a rhythm, too,
about that line of peaks against the sky, and the girl had caught
it; he watched her sway with the gallop of her horse and felt that
though she was so close at hand she was a thousand miles from him.
She concealed nothing, and yet he could no more see her naked soul
than he could tear the veils of shadow from the mountains. Not that
the doctor phrased his emotions in words. He was only conscious of
a sense of awe and the necessity of silence.</p>

<p>A strange feeling for the doctor! He came from the region of the
mind where that which is not spoken does not exist, and now this
girl was carrying him swiftly away from hypotheses, doubts, and
polysyllabic speech into the world&mdash;of what? The spirit? The
doctor did not know. He only felt that he was about to step into
the unknown, and it held for him the fascination of the suspended
action of a statue. Let it not be thought that he calmly accepted
the sheer necessity for silence. He fought against it, but no words
came.</p>

<p>It was evening: the rolling hills about them were already dark;
only the heads of the mountains took the day; and now they paused
at the top of a rise and the girl pointed across the hollow. "There
we are," she said. It was a tall clump of trees through which broke
the outlines of a two-storied house larger than any the doctor had
seen in the mountain-desert; and outside the trees lay long sheds,
a great barn, and a wide-spread wilderness of corrals. It struck
the doctor with its apparently limitless capacity for housing man
and beast. Coming in contrast with the rock-strewn desolation of
the plains, this was a great establishment; the doctor had ridden
out with a waif of the desert and she had turned into a princess at
a stroke. Then, for the first time since they left Elkhead, he
remembered with a start that he was to care for a sick man in that
house.</p>

<p>"You were to tell me," he said, "something about the sickness of
your father&mdash;the background behind his condition. But we've
both forgotten about it."</p>

<p>"I have been thinking how I could describe it, every moment of
the ride," she answered. Then, as the gloom fell more thickly
around them every moment, she swerved her horse over to the mare,
as if it were necessary that she read the face of the doctor while
she spoke.</p>

<p>"Six months ago," she said, "my father was robust and active in
spite of his age. He was cheerful, busy, and optimistic. But he
fell into a decline. It has not been a sudden sapping of his
strength. If it were that I should not worry so much; I'd attribute
it to disease. But every day something of vitality goes from him.
He is fading almost from hour to hour, as slowly as the hour hand
of a clock. You can't notice the change, but every twelve hours the
hand makes a complete revolution. It's as if his blood were
evaporating and nothing we can do will supply him with fresh
strength."</p>

<p>"Is this attended by irritability?"</p>

<p>"He is perfectly calm and seems to have no care for what becomes
of him."</p>

<p>"Has he lost interest in the things which formerly attracted and
occupied him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he minds nothing now. He has no care for the condition of
the cattle, or for profit or loss in the sales. He has simply
stepped out of every employment."</p>

<p>"Ah, a gradual diminution of the faculties of attention."</p>

<p>"In a way, yes. But also he is more alive than he has ever been.
He seems to hear with uncanny distinctness, for instance."</p>

<p>The doctor frowned.</p>

<p>"I was inclined to attribute his decline to the operation of old
age," he remarked, "but this is unusual. This&mdash;er&mdash;inner
acuteness is accompanied by no particular interest in any one
thing?"</p>

<p>As she did not reply for the moment he was about to accept the
silence for acquiescence, but then through the dimness he was
arrested by the lustre of her eyes, fixed, apparently, far beyond
him.</p>

<p>"One thing," she said at length. "Yes, there is one thing in
which he retains an interest."</p>

<p>The doctor nodded brightly.</p>

<p>"Good!" he said. "And that&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The silence fell again, but this time he was more roused and he
fixed his eyes keenly upon her through the gloom. She was deeply
troubled; one hand gripped the horn of her saddle strongly; her
lips had parted; she was like one who endures inescapable pain. He
could not tell whether it was the slight breeze which disturbed her
blouse or the rapid panting of her breath.</p>

<p>"Of that," she said, "it is hard to speak&mdash;it is useless to
speak!"</p>

<p>"Surely not!" protested the doctor. "The cause, my dear madame,
though perhaps apparently remote from the immediate issue, is of
the utmost significance in diagnosis."</p>

<p>She broke in rapidly: "This is all I can tell you: he is waiting
for something which will never come. He has missed something from
his life which will never come back into it. Then why should we
discuss what it is that he has missed."</p>

<p>"To the critical mind," replied the doctor calmly, and he
automatically adjusted his glasses closer to his eyes, "nothing is
without significance."</p>

<p>"It is nearly dark!" she exclaimed hurriedly. "Let us ride
on."</p>

<p>"First," he suggested, "I must tell you that before I left
Elkhead I heard a hint of some remarkable story concerning a man
and a horse and a dog. Is there anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>But it seemed that she did not hear. He heard a sharp, low
exclamation which might have been addressed to her horse, and the
next instant she was galloping swiftly down the slope. The doctor
followed as fast as he could, jouncing in the saddle until he was
quite out of breath.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap4" name="chap4">4. THE CHAIN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">They had hardly passed the front door of the house
when they were met by a tall man with dark hair and dark, deep-set
eyes. He was tanned to the bronze of an Indian, and he might have
been termed handsome had not his features been so deeply cut and
roughly finished. His black hair was quite long, and as the wind
from the opened door stirred it, there was a touch of wildness
about the fellow that made the heart of Randall Byrne jump. When
this man saw the girl his face lighted, briefly; when his glance
fell on Byrne the light went out.</p>

<p>"Couldn't get the doc, Kate?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not Doctor Hardin," she answered, "and I've brought Doctor
Byrne instead."</p>

<p>The tall man allowed his gaze to drift leisurely from head to
foot of Randall Byrne.</p>

<p>Then: "H'ware you, doc?" he said, and extended a big hand. It
occurred to Byrne that all these men of the mountain-desert were
big; there was something intensely irritating about their mere
physical size; they threw him continually on the defensive and he
found himself making apologies to himself and summing up personal
merits. In this case there was more direct reason for his anger. It
was patent that the man did not weight the strange doctor against
any serious thoughts.</p>

<p>"And this," she was saying, "is Mr. Daniels. Buck, is there any
change?"</p>

<p>"Nothin' much," answered Buck Daniels. "Come along towards
evening and he said he was feeling kind of cold. So I wrapped him
up in a rug. Then he sat some as usual, one hand inside of the
other, looking steady at nothing. But a while ago he began getting
sort of nervous."</p>

<p>"What did he do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I just <i>felt</i> he was getting excited. The way you
know when your hoss is going to shy."</p>

<p>"Do you want to go to your room first, doctor, or will you go in
to see him now?"</p>

<p>"Now," decided the doctor, and followed her down the hall and
through a door.</p>

<p>The room reminded the doctor more of a New England interior than
of the mountain-desert. There was a round rag rug on the floor with
every imaginable colour woven into its texture, but blended with a
rude design, reds towards the centre and blue-greys towards the
edges. There were chairs upholstered in green which looked
mouse-coloured where the high lights struck along the backs and the
arms&mdash;shallow-seated chairs that made one's knees project
foolishly high and far. Byrne saw a cabinet at one end of the room,
filled with sea-shells and knicknacks, and above it was a memorial
cross surrounded by a wreath inside a glass case. Most of the wall
space thronged with engravings whose subjects ranged from Niagara
Falls to Lady Hamilton. One entire end of the room was occupied by
a painting of a neck and neck finish in a race, and the artist had
conceived the blooded racers as creatures with tremendous round
hips and mighty-muscled shoulders, while the legs tapered to a
faun-like delicacy. These animals were spread-eagled in the most
amazing fashion, their fore-hoofs reaching beyond their noses and
their rear hoofs striking out beyond the tips of the tails. The
jockey in the lead sat quite still, but he who was losing had his
whip drawn and looked like an automatic doll&mdash;so pink were his
cheeks. Beside the course, in attitudes of graceful ease, stood men
in very tight trousers and very high stocks and ladies in dresses
which pinched in at the waist and flowed out at the shoulders. They
leaned upon canes or twirled parasols and they had their backs
turned upon the racetrack as if they found their own negligent
conversation far more exciting than the breathless, driving
finish.</p>

<p>Under the terrific action and still more terrific quiescence of
this picture lay the sick man, propped high on a couch and wrapped
to the chest in a Navajo blanket.</p>

<p>"Dad," said Kate Cumberland, "Doctor Hardin was not in town.
I've brought out Doctor Byrne, a newcomer."</p>

<p>The invalid turned his white head slowly towards them, and his
shaggy brows lifted and fell slightly&mdash;a passing shadow of
annoyance. It was a very stern face, and framed in the long, white
hair it seemed surrounded by an atmosphere of Arctic chill. He was
thin, terribly thin&mdash;not the leanness of Byrne, but a grim
emaciation which exaggerated the size of a tall forehead and made
his eyes supernally bright. It was in the first glance of those
eyes that Byrne recognized the restlessness of which Kate had
spoken; and he felt almost as if it were an inner fire which had
burned and still was wasting the body of Joseph Cumberland. To the
attentions of the doctor the old man submitted with patient
self-control, and Byrne found a pulse feeble, rapid, but steady.
There was no temperature. In fact, the heat of the body was a
trifle sub-normal, considering that the heart was beating so
rapidly.</p>

<p>Doctor Byrne started. Most of his work had been in laboratories,
and the horror of death was not yet familiar, but old Joseph
Cumberland was dying. It was not a matter of moment. Death might be
a week or a month away, but die soon he inevitably must; for the
doctor saw that the fire was still raging in the hollow breast of
the cattleman, but there was no longer fuel to feed it.</p>

<p>He stared again, and more closely. Fire without fuel to feed
it!</p>

<p>Doctor Byrne gave what seemed to be an infinitely muffled cry of
exultation, so faint that it was hardly a whisper; then he leaned
closer and pored over Joe Cumberland with a lighted eye. One might
have thought that the doctor was gloating over the sick man.</p>

<p>Suddenly he straightened and began to pace up and down the room,
muttering to himself. Kate Cumberland listened intently and she
thought that what the man muttered so rapidly, over and over to
himself, was: "Eureka! Eureka! I have found it!"</p>

<p>Found what? The triumph of mind over matter!</p>

<p>On that couch was a dead body. The flutter of that heart was not
the strong beating of the normal organ; the hands were cold; even
the body was chilled; yet the man lived.</p>

<p>Or, rather, his brain lived, and compelled the shattered and
outworn body to comply with its will. Doctor Byrne turned and
stared again at the face of Cumberland. He felt as if he
understood, now, the look which was concentrated so brightly on the
vacant air. It was illumined by a steady and desperate defiance,
for the old man was denying his body to the grave.</p>

<p>The scene changed for Randall Byrne. The girl disappeared. The
walls of the room were broken away. The eyes of the world looked in
upon him and the wise men of the world kept pace with him up and
down the room, shaking their heads and saying: "It is not
possible!"</p>

<p>But the fact lay there to contradict them.</p>

<p>Prometheus stole fire from heaven and paid it back to an eternal
death. The old cattleman was refusing his payment. It was no state
of coma in which he lay; it was no prolonged trance. He was
vitally, vividly alive; he was concentrating with a bitter and
exhausting vigour day and night, and fighting a battle the more
terrible because it was fought in silence, a battle in which he
could receive no aid, no reinforcement, a battle in which he could
not win, but in which he might delay defeat.</p>

<p>Ay, the wise men would smile and shake their heads when he
presented this case to their consideration, but he would make his
account so accurate and particular and so well witnessed that they
would have to admit the truth of all he said. And science, which
proclaimed that matter was indestructible and that the mind was
matter and that the brain needed nourishment like any other
muscle&mdash;science would have to hang the head and wonder!</p>

<p>The eyes of the girl brought him to halt in his pacing, and he
stopped, confronting her. His excitement had transformed him. His
nostrils were quivering, his eyes were pointed with light, his head
was high, and he breathed fast. He was flushed as the Roman
Conqueror. And his excitement tinged the girl, also, with
colour.</p>

<p>She offered to take him to his room as soon as he wished to go.
He was quite willing. He wanted to be alone, to think. But when he
followed her she stopped him in the hall. Buck Daniels lumbered
slowly after them in a clumsy attempt at sauntering.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Kate Cumberland.</p>

<p>She had thrown a blue mantle over her shoulders when she entered
the house, and the touch of boyish self-confidence which had been
hers on the ride was gone. In its place there was something even
more difficult for Randall Byrne to face. If there had been a
garish brightness about her when he had first seen her, the
brilliancy of a mirror playing in the sun against his feeble eyes,
there was now a blending of pastel shades, for the hall was dimly
illumined and the shadow tarnished her hair and her pallor was like
cold stone; even her eyes were misted by fear. Yet a vital sense of
her nearness swept upon Byrne, and he felt as if he were
surrounded&mdash;by a danger.</p>

<p>"Opinions," said the doctor, "based on so summary an examination
are necessarily inexact, yet the value of a first impression is not
negligible. The best I can say is that there is probably no
immediate danger, but Mr. Cumberland is seriously ill. Furthermore,
it is <i>not</i> old age."</p>

<p>He would not say all he thought; it was not yet time.</p>

<p>She winced and clasped her hands tightly together. She was like
a child about to be punished for a crime it has not committed, and
it came vaguely to the doctor that he might have broached his ill
tidings more gently.</p>

<p>He added: "I must have further opportunities for observance
before I give a detailed opinion and suggest a treatment."</p>

<p>Her glance wandered past him and at once the heavy step of Buck
Daniels approached.</p>

<p>"At least," she murmured, "I am glad that you are frank. I don't
want to have anything kept from me, please. Buck, will you take the
doctor up to his room?" She managed a faint smile. "This is an
old-fashioned house, Doctor Byrne, but I hope we can make you
fairly comfortable. You'll ask for whatever you need?"</p>

<p>The doctor bowed, and was told that they would dine in half an
hour, then the girl went back towards the room in which Joe
Cumberland lay. She walked slowly, with her head bent, and her
posture seemed to Byrne the very picture of a burden-bearer. Then
he followed Daniels up the stairs, led by the jingling of the
spurs, great-rowelled spurs that might grip the side of a
refractory horse like teeth.</p>

<p>A hall-light guided them, and from the hall Buck Daniels entered
a room and fumbled above him until he had lighted a lamp which was
suspended by two chains from the ceiling, a circular burner which
cast a glow as keen as an electric globe. It brought out every
detail of the old-fashioned room&mdash;the bare, painted floor; the
bed, in itself a separate and important piece of architecture with
its four tall posts, a relic of the times when beds were built, not
simply made; and there was a chest of drawers with swelling,
hospitable front, and a rectangular mirror above with its date in
gilt paint on the upper edge. A rising wind shook the window and
through some crack stirred the lace curtains; it was a very
comfortable retreat, and the doctor became aware of aching muscles
and a heavy brain when he glanced at the bed.</p>

<p>The same gust of wind which rattled the window-pane now pushed,
as with invisible and ghostly hand, a door which opened on the side
of the bedroom, and as it swung mysteriously and gradually wide the
doctor found himself looking into an adjoining chamber. All he
could see clearly was a corner on which struck the shaft of light
from the lamp, and lying on the floor in that corner was something
limp and brown. A snake, he surmised at first, but then he saw
clearly that it was a chain of formidable proportions bolted
against the wall at one end and terminating at the other in a huge
steel collar. A chill started in the boots of the doctor and
wriggled its uncomfortable way up to his head.</p>

<p>"Hell!" burst out Buck Daniels. "How'd <i>that</i> door get
open?" He slammed it with violence. "She's been in there again, I
guess," muttered the cowpuncher, as he stepped back, scowling.</p>

<p>"Who?" ventured the doctor.</p>

<p>Buck Daniels whirled on him.</p>

<p>"None of your&mdash;" he began hotly, but checked himself with
choking suddenness and strode heavily from the room.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap5" name="chap5">5. THE WAITING</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The doctor removed his coat with absent-minded
slowness, and all the time that he was removing the dust and the
stains of travel, he kept narrowing the eye of his mind to
visualise more clearly that cumbersome chain which lay on the floor
of the adjoining room. Now, the doctor was not of a curious or
gossipy nature, but if someone had offered to tell him the story of
that chain for a thousand dollars, the doctor at that moment would
have thought the price ridiculously small.</p>

<p>Then the doctor went down to the dinner table prepared to keep
one eye upon Buck Daniels and the other upon Kate Cumberland. But
if he expected to learn through conversation at the table he was
grievously disappointed, for Buck Daniels ate with an eye to strict
business that allowed no chatter, and the girl sat with a forced
smile and an absent eye. Now and again Buck would glance up at her,
watch her for an instant, and then turn his attention back to his
plate with a sort of gloomy resolution; there were not half a dozen
words exchanged from the beginning to the end of the meal.</p>

<p>After that they went in to the invalid. He lay in the same
position, his skinny hands crossed upon his breast, and his shaggy
brows were drawn so low that the eyes were buried in profound
shadow. They took positions in a loose semi-circle, all pointing
towards the sick man, and it reminded Byrne with grim force of a
picture he had seen of three wolves waiting for the bull moose to
sink in the snows: they, also, were waiting for a death. It seemed,
indeed, as if death must have already come; at least it could not
make him more moveless than he was. Against the dark wall his
profile was etched by a sharp highlight which was brightest of all
on his forehead and his nose; while the lower portion of the face
was lost in comparative shadow.</p>

<p>So perfect and so detailed was the resemblance to death, indeed,
that the lips in the shadow smiled&mdash;fixedly. It was not until
Kate Cumberland shifted a lamp, throwing more light on her father,
that Byrne saw that the smile was in reality a forcible compression
of the lips. He understood, suddenly, that the silent man on the
couch was struggling terribly against an hysteria of emotion. It
brought beads of sweat out upon the doctor's tall forehead; for
this perfect repose suggested an agony more awful than yells and
groans and struggles. The silence was like acid; it burned without
a flame. And Byrne knew, that moment, the quality of the thing
which had wasted the rancher. It was this acid of grief or yearning
which had eaten deep into him and was now close to his heart. The
girl had said that for six months he had been failing. Six months!
Six eternities of burning at the stake!</p>

<p>He lay silent, waiting; and his resignation meant that he knew
death would come before that for which he waited. Silence, that was
the key-note of the room. The girl was silent, her eyes dark with
grief; yet they were not fixed upon her father. It came thrilling
home to Byrne that her sorrow was not entirely for her dying
parent, for she looked beyond him rather than at him. Was she, too,
waiting? Was that what gave her the touch of sad gravity, the
mystery like the mystery of distance?</p>

<p>And Buck Daniels. He, also, said nothing. He rolled cigarettes
one after another with amazing dexterity and smoked them with half
a dozen Titanic breaths. His was a single-track mind. He loved the
girl, and he bore the sign of his love on his face. He wanted her
desperately; it was a hunger like that of Tantalus, too keen to be
ever satisfied. Yet, still more than he looked at the girl, he,
also, stared into the distance. He, also, was waiting!</p>

<p>It was the deep suspense of Cumberland which made him so
silently alert. He was as intensely alive as the receiver of a
wireless apparatus; he gathered information from the empty air.</p>

<p>So that Byrne was hardly surprised, when, in the midst of that
grim silence, the old man raised a rigid forefinger of warning.
Kate and Daniels stiffened in their chairs and Byrne felt his flesh
creep. Of course it was nothing. The wind, which had shaken the
house with several strong gusts before dinner, had now grown
stronger and blew with steadily increasing violence; perhaps the
sad old man had been attracted by the mournful chorus and imagined
some sound he knew within it.</p>

<p>But now once more the finger was raised, the arm extended,
shaking violently, and Joe Cumberland turned upon them a glance
which flashed with a delirious and unhealthy joy.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he cried. "Again!"</p>

<p>"What?" asked Kate.</p>

<p>"I hear them, I tell you."</p>

<p>Her lips blanched, and parted to speak, but she checked the
impulse and looked swiftly about the room with what seemed to Byrne
an appeal for help. As for Buck Daniels, he changed from a dark
bronze to an unhealthy yellow; fear, plain and grimly unmistakable,
was in his face. Then he strode to the window and threw it open
with a crash. The wind leaped in and tossed the flame in the throat
of the chimney, so that great shadows waved suddenly through the
room, and made the chairs seem afloat. Even the people were
suddenly unreal. And the rush of the storm gave Byrne an eerie
sensation of being blown through infinite space. For a moment there
was only the sound of the gale and the flapping of a loose picture
against the wall, and the rattling of a newspaper. Then he heard
it.</p>

<p>First it was a single note which he could not place. It was
music, and yet it was discordant, and it had the effect of a blast
of icy wind.</p>

<p>Once he had been in Egypt and had stood in a corridor of Cheops'
pyramid. The torch had been blown out in the hand of his guide.
From somewhere in the black depths before them came a laugh, made
unhuman by echoes. And Byrne had visioned the mummied dead pushing
back the granite lids of their sarcophagi and sitting upright.</p>

<p>But that was nothing compared with this. Not half so wild or
strange.</p>

<p>He listened again, breathless, with the sharp prickling running
up and down his spine. It was the honking of the wild geese, flying
north. And out of the sound he builded a picture of the grey
triangle cleaving through the cold upper sky, sent on a mission no
man could understand.</p>

<p>"Was I right? Was I right?" shrilled the invalid, and when Byrne
turned towards him, he saw the old man sitting erect, with an
expression of wild triumph. There came an indescribable cry from
the girl, and a deep throated curse from Buck Daniels as he slammed
down the window.</p>

<p>With the chill blast shut off and the flame burning steadily
once more in the lamp, a great silence besieged the room, with a
note of expectancy in it. Byrne was conscious of being warm, too
warm. It was close in the room, and he was weighted down. It was as
if another presence had stepped into the room and stood invisible.
He felt it with unspeakable keenness, as when one knows certainly
the thoughts which pass in the mind of another. And, more than
that, he knew that the others in the room felt what he felt. In the
waiting silence he saw that the old man lay on his couch with eyes
of fire and gaping lips, as if he drank the wine of his joyous
expectancy. And big Buck Daniels stood with his hand on the sash of
the window, frozen there, his eyes bulging, his heart thundering in
his throat. And Kate Cumberland sat with her eyes closed, as she
had closed them when the wind first rushed upon her, and she still
smiled as she had smiled then. And to Byrne, more terrible than the
joy of Joseph Cumberland or the dread of Buck Daniels was the smile
and the closed eyes of the girl.</p>

<p>But the silence held and the fifth presence was in the room, and
not one of them dared speak.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap6" name="chap6">6. THE MISSION STARTS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Then, with a shifting of the wind, a song was
blown to them from the bunk-house, a cheerful, ringing chorus; the
sound was like daylight&mdash;it drove the terror from the room.
Joe Cumberland asked them to leave him. That night, he said, he
would sleep. He felt it, like a promise. The other three went out
from the room.</p>

<p>In the hall Kate and Daniels stood close together under a faint
light from the wall-lamp, and they talked as if they had forgotten
the presence of Byrne.</p>

<p>"It had to come," she said. "I knew it would come to him sooner
or later, but I didn't dream it would be as terrible as this. Buck,
what are we going to do?"</p>

<p>"God knows," said the big cowpuncher. "Just wait, I s'pose, same
as we've been doing."</p>

<p>He had aged wonderfully in that moment of darkness.</p>

<p>"He'll be happy now for a few days," went on the girl, "but
afterwards&mdash;when he realises that it means nothing&mdash;what
then, Buck?"</p>

<p>The man took her hands and began to pat them softly as a father
might soothe a child.</p>

<p>"I seen you when the wind come in," he said gently. "Are you
going to stand it, Kate? Is it going to be hell for you, too, every
time you hear 'em?"</p>

<p>She answered: "If it were only I! Yes, I could stand it. Lately
I've begun to think that I can stand anything. But when I see Dad
it breaks my heart&mdash;and you&mdash;oh, Buck, it hurts, it
hurts!" She drew his hands impulsively against her breast. "If it
were only something we could fight outright!"</p>

<p>Buck Daniels sighed.</p>

<p>"Fight?" he echoed hopelessly. "Fight? Against him? Kate, you're
all tired out. Go to bed, honey, and try to stop
thinkin'&mdash;and&mdash;God help us all!"</p>

<p>She turned away from him and passed the
doctor&mdash;blindly.</p>

<p>Buck Daniels had set his foot on the stairs when Byrne hurried
after him and touched his arm; they went up together.</p>

<p>"Mr. Daniels," said the doctor, "it is necessary that I speak
with you, alone. Will you come into my room for a few moments?"</p>

<p>"Doc," said the cattleman, "I'm short on my feed and I don't
feel a pile like talkin'. Can't you wait till the morning?"</p>

<p>"There has been a great deal too much waiting, Mr. Daniels,"
said the doctor. "What I have to say to you must be said now. Will
you come in?"</p>

<p>"I will," nodded Buck Daniels. "But cut it short."</p>

<p>Once in his room the doctor lighted the lamp and then locked the
door.</p>

<p>"What's all the mystery and hush stuff?" growled Daniels, and
with a gesture he refused the proffered chair. "Cut loose, doc, and
make it short."</p>

<p>The little man sat down, removed his glasses, held them up to
the light, found a speck upon them, polished it carefully away,
replaced the spectacles upon his nose, and peered thoughtfully at
Buck Daniels.</p>

<p>Buck Daniels rolled his eyes towards the door and then even
towards the window, and then, as one who accepts the inevitable, he
sank into a chair and plunged his hands into his pockets, prepared
to endure.</p>

<p>"I am called," went on the doctor dryly, "to examine a case in
which the patient is dangerously ill&mdash;in fact, hopelessly ill,
and I have found that the cause of his illness is a state of
nervous expectancy on the part of the sufferer. It being obviously
necessary to know the nature of the disease and its cause before
that cause may be removed, I have asked you to sit here this
evening to give me whatever explanation you may have for it."</p>

<p>Buck Daniels stirred uneasily. At length he broke out: "Doc, I
size you up as a gent with brains. I got one piece of advice for
you: get the hell away from the Cumberland Ranch and never come
back again!"</p>

<p>The doctor flushed and his lean jaw thrust out.</p>

<p>"Although," he said, "I cannot pretend to be classed among those
to whom physical fear is an unknown, yet I wish to assure you, sir,
that with me physical trepidation is not an overruling motive."</p>

<p>"Oh, hell!" groaned Buck Daniels. Then he explained more gently:
"I don't say you're yellow. All I say is: this mess ain't one that
you can straighten out&mdash;nor no other man can. Give it up, wash
your hands, and git back to Elkhead. I dunno what Kate was thinkin'
of to bring you out here!"</p>

<p>"The excellence of your intention," said the doctor, "I shall
freely admit, though the assumption that difficulty in the
essential problem would deter me from the analysis is an hypothesis
which I cannot leave uncontested. In the vulgar, I may give you to
understand that I am in this to stay!"</p>

<p>Buck Daniels started to speak, but thinking better of it he
shrugged his shoulders and sat back, resigned.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "Kate brought you out here. Maybe she has a
reason for it. What d'you want to know?"</p>

<p>"What connection," said the doctor, "have wild geese with a man,
a horse, and a dog?"</p>

<p>"What in hell d'you know about a horse and a man and a
dog&mdash;and wild geese?" inquired Buck in a strained voice.</p>

<p>"Rumour," said the doctor, "has been in this instance,
unfortunately, my only teacher. But, sir, I have ascertained that
Mr. Cumberland, his daughter, and you, sir, are all waiting for a
certain thing to come to this ranch, and that thing I naturally
assume to be a man."</p>

<p>"Doc," said the cowpuncher sarcastically, "there ain't no doubt
you got a wonderful brain!"</p>

<p>"Mockery," pronounced the man of learning, "is a use of the
mental powers which is both unworthy and barren and does not in
this case advance the argument, which is: Who and what is this man
for whom you wait?"</p>

<p>"He came," said Buck Daniels, "out of nowhere. That's all we
know about who he is. What is he? I'll tell you easy: he's a gent
that looks like a man, and walks like a man, and talks like a
man&mdash;but he <i>ain't</i> a man."</p>

<p>"Ah," nodded the philosopher, "a crime of extraordinary
magnitude has, perhaps, cut off this unfortunate fellow from
communication with others of his kind. Is this the case?"</p>

<p>"It ain't," replied Buck. "Doc, tell me this: Can a wolf commit
a crime?"</p>

<p>"Admitting this definition: that crime is the breaking of law,
and that law is a force created by reason to control the rational,
it may be granted that the acts of the lower animals lie outside of
categories framed according to ethical precepts. To directly answer
your not incurious question: I believe that a wolf cannot commit a
crime."</p>

<p>Buck Daniels sighed.</p>

<p>"D'you know, doc," he said gravely, "that you remind me of a
side-hill goat?"</p>

<p>"Ah," murmured the man of learning, "is it possible? And what,
Mr. Daniels, is the nature of a side-hill goat?"</p>

<p>"It's a goat that's got the legs of one side shorter than the
legs on the other side, and the only way he can get to the top of a
hill is to keep trottin' around and around the hill like a five per
cent. grade. He goes a mile to get ten feet higher."</p>

<p>"This fact," said Byrne, and he rubbed his chin thoughtfully,
"is not without interest, though I fail to perceive the relation
between me and such a creature, unless, perhaps, there are biologic
similarities of which I have at present no cognition."</p>

<p>"I didn't think you'd follow me," replied Buck with an equal
gravity. "But you can lay to this, Doc; this gent we're waitin' for
ain't committed any more crimes than a wolf has."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see," murmured the doctor, "a man so near the brute that
his enormities pass beyond&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get this straight," said Buck, interrupting with a sternly
pointed finger: "There ain't a kinder or a gentler man in the
mountain-desert than him. He's got a voice softer than Kate
Cumberland's, which is some soft voice, and as for his
heart&mdash;Doc, I've seen him get off his horse to put a wounded
rabbit out of its pain!"</p>

<p>A ring of awe came in the throat of Daniels as he repeated the
incredible fact.</p>

<p>He went on: "If I was in trouble, I'd rather have him beside me
than ten other men; if I was sick I'd rather have him than the ten
best doctors in the world; if I wanted a pal that would die for
them that done him good and go to hell to get them that done him
bad, I'd choose him first, and there ain't none that come
second."</p>

<p>The panegyric was not a burst of imagination. Buck Daniels was
speaking seriously, hunting for words, and if he used superlatives
it was because he needed them.</p>

<p>"Extraordinary!" murmured the doctor, and he repeated the word
in a louder tone. It was a rare word for him; in all his scholastic
career and in all of his scientific investigations he had found
occasion to use so strong a term not more than half a dozen times
at the most. He went on, cautiously, and his weak eyes blinked at
Daniels: "And there is a relation between this man and a horse and
dog?"</p>

<p>Buck Daniels shuddered and his colour changed.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he said, "I've talked enough. You ain't going to get
another word out of me except this: Doc, have a good sleep, get on
your hoss to-morrow mornin', and beat it. Don't even wait for
breakfast. Because, if you <i>do</i> wait, you may get a hand in
this little hell of ours. You may be waiting, too!" A sudden
thought brought him to his feet. He stood over the doctor. "How
many times," he thundered, "have you seen Kate Cumberland?"</p>

<p>"To-day, for the first time."</p>

<p>"Well," said Daniels, growling with relief, "you've seen her
enough. I <i>know</i>." And he turned towards the door. "Unlock,"
he commanded. "I'm tired out&mdash;and sick&mdash;of talking about
<i>him</i>."</p>

<p>But the doctor did not move.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," he stated, "you will remain. There is something
further which you know and which you will communicate to me."</p>

<p>Buck Daniels turned at the door; his face was not pleasant.</p>

<p>"While observing you as you talked with the girl," Byrne said,
"it occurred to me that you were holding information from her. The
exact nature of that information I cannot state, but it is
reasonable to deduct that you could, at the present moment, name
the place where the man for whom Mr. Cumberland and his daughter
wait is now located."</p>

<p>Buck Daniels made no reply, but he returned to his chair and
slumped heavily into it, staring at the little doctor. And Byrne
realised with a thrill of pleasure that he was not afraid of
death.</p>

<p>"I may further deduct," said the doctor, "that you will go in
person to the place where you know this man may be found and induce
him to come to this ranch."</p>

<p>The silent anger of Daniels died away. He smiled, and at length
he laughed without mirth.</p>

<p>"Doc," he said, "if you knew where there was a gun, would that
make you want to put it up agin your head and pull the
trigger?"</p>

<p>But the doctor proceeded inexorably with his deductions:
"Because you are aware, Mr. Daniels, that the presence of this man
may save the life of Mr. Cumberland, a thought, to be sure, which
might not be accepted by the medical fraternity, but which may
without undue exaggeration devolve from the psychological situation
in this house."</p>

<p>"Doc," said Daniels huskily, "you talk straight, and you act
straight, and I think you are straight, so I'll take off the bridle
and talk free. I know where Whistling Dan is&mdash;just about. But
if I was to go to him and bring him here I'd bust the heart of Kate
Cumberland. D'you understand?" His voice lowered with an intense
emotion. "I've thought it out sideways and backwards. It's Kate or
old Joe. Which is the most important?"</p>

<p>The doctor straightened in the chair, polished his glasses, and
peered once more at the cowpuncher.</p>

<p>"You are quite sure, also, that the return of this man, this
strange wanderer, might help Mr. Cumberland back to health?"</p>

<p>"I am, all right. He's sure wrapped up in Whistlin' Dan."</p>

<p>"What is the nature of their relations; what makes him so oddly
dependent upon the other?"</p>

<p>"I dunno, doc. It's got us all fooled. When Dan is here it seems
like old Cumberland jest nacherally lives on the things Dan does
and hears and sees. We've seen Cumberland prick up his ears the
minute Dan comes into the room, and show life. Sometimes Dan sits
with him and tells him what he's been doin'&mdash;maybe it ain't
any more than how the sky looks that day, or about the feel of the
wind&mdash;but Joe sits with his eyes dreamin', like a little kid
hearin' fairy stories. Kate says it's been that way since her dad
first brought Dan in off'n the range. He's been sort of necessary
to old Joe&mdash;almost like air to breathe. I tell you, it's jest
a picture to see them two together."</p>

<p>"Very odd, very odd," brooded the doctor, frowning, "but this
seems to be an odd place and an odd set of people. You've no real
idea why Dan left the ranch?"</p>

<p>"Ask the wild geese," said Buck bitterly. He added: "Maybe you'd
better ask Dan's black hoss or his dog, Bart. They'd know better'n
anything else."</p>

<p>"But what has the man been doing since he left? Have you any
idea?"</p>

<p>"Get a little chatter, now and then, of a gent that's rid into a
town on a black hoss, prettier'n anything that was ever seen
before.</p>

<p>"It's all pretty much the same, what news we get. Mostly I guess
he jest wanders around doin' no harm to nobody. But once in a while
somebody sicks a dog on Bart, and Bart jest nacherally chaws that
dog in two. Then the owner of the dog may start a fight, and Dan
drops him and rides on."</p>

<p>"With a trail of dead men behind him?" cried the doctor,
hunching his shoulders as if to shake off a chill.</p>

<p>"Dead? Nope. You don't have to shoot to kill when you can handle
a gun the way Dan does. Nope, he jest wings 'em. Plants a chunk of
lead in a shoulder, or an arm, or a leg. That's all. They ain't no
love of blood in Dan&mdash;except&mdash;-"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Doc," said Buck with a shudder, "I ain't goin' to talk about
the exceptions. Mostly the news we gets of Dan is about troubles
he's had. But sometimes we hear of gents he's helped out when they
was sick, and things like that. They ain't nobody like Dan when a
gent is down sick, I'll tell a man!"</p>

<p>The doctor sighed.</p>

<p>He said: "And do I understand you to say that the girl and this
man&mdash;Whistling Dan, as you call him&mdash;are intimately and
sentimentally related?"</p>

<p>"She loves him," said Daniels slowly. "She loves the ground he
walks on and the places where he's been."</p>

<p>"But, sir, it would seem probable from your own reasoning that
the return of the man, in this case, will not be unwelcome to
her."</p>

<p>"Reason?" broke out Daniels bitterly. "What the hell has reason
got to do with Whistling Dan? Man, man! if Barry was to come back
d'you suppose he'd remember that he'd once told Kate he loved her?
Doc, I know him as near as any man can know him. I tell you, he
thinks no more of her than&mdash;than the wild geese think of her.
If old Joe dies because Dan is away&mdash;well, Cumberland is an
old man anyway. But how could I stand to see Barry pass Kate by
with an empty eye, the way he'd do if he come back? I'd want to
kill him, and I'd get bumped off tryin' it, like as not. And what
would it do to Kate? It'd kill her, Doc, as sure as you're
born."</p>

<p>"Your assumption being," murmured the doctor, "that if she never
sees the man again she will eventually forget him."</p>

<p>"D'you forget a knife that's sticking into you? No, she won't
forget him. But maybe after a while she'll be able to stand
thinkin' about him. She'll get used to the hurt. She'll be able to
talk and laugh the way she used to. Oh, doc, if you could of seen
her as I've seen her in the old days&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When the man was with her?" cut in the doctor.</p>

<p>Buck Daniels caught his breath.</p>

<p>"Damn your eternal soul, doc!" he said softly.</p>

<p>And for a time neither of them spoke. Whatever went on in the
mind of Daniels, it was something that contorted his face. As for
Byrne, he was trying to match fact and possibility and he was
finding a large gap between the two; for he tried to visualise the
man whose presence had been food to old Joe Cumberland, and whose
absence had taken the oil from the lamp so that the flame now
flickered dimly, nearly out. But he could build no such picture. He
could merely draw together a vague abstraction of a man to whom the
storm and the wild geese who ride the storm had meaning and
relationship. The logic which he loved was breaking to pieces in
the hands of Randall Byrne.</p>

<p>Silence, after all, is only a name, never a fact. There are
noises in the most absolute quiet. If there is not even the sound
of the cricket or the wind, if there are not even ghost whispers in
the house, there is the sigh of one's own breathing, and in those
moments of deadly waiting the beat of the heart may be as loud and
as awful as the rattle of the death-march. Now, between the doctor
and the cowpuncher, such a silence began. Buck Daniels wanted
nothing more in the world than to be out of that room, but the eye
of the doctor held him, unwilling. And there began once more that
eternal waiting, waiting, waiting, which was the horror of the
place, until the faint creakings through the windshaken house took
on the meaning of footsteps stalking down the hall and pausing at
the door, and there was the hushing breath of one who listened and
smiled to himself! Now the doctor became aware that the eye of Buck
Daniels was widening, brightening; it was as if the mind of the big
man were giving way in the strain. His face blanched. Even the lips
had no colour, and they moved, gibberingly.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he said.</p>

<p>"It is the wind," answered the doctor, but his voice was hardly
audible.</p>

<p>"Listen!" commanded Daniels again.</p>

<p>The doctor could hear it then. It was a pulse of sound obscure
as the thudding of his heart. But it was a human sound and it made
his throat close up tightly, as if a hand were settling around his
wind-pipe. Buck Daniels rose from his chair; that half-mad,
half-listening look was still in his eyes&mdash;behind his eyes.
Staring at him, the doctor understood, intimately, how men can
throw their lives away gloriously in battle, fighting for an idea,
or how they can commit secret and foul murder. Yet he was more
afraid of that pulse of sound than of the face of Buck Daniels. He,
also, was rising from his chair, and when Daniels stalked to the
side door of the room and leaned there, the doctor followed.</p>

<p>Then they could hear it clearly. There was a note of music in
the voice; it was a woman weeping in that room where the chain lay
on the floor, coiled loosely like a snake. Buck Daniels
straightened and moved away from the door. He began to laugh,
guarding it so that not a whisper could break outside the room, and
his silent laughter was the most horrible thing the doctor had ever
seen. It was only for a moment. The hysteria passed and left the
big man shaking like a dead leaf.</p>

<p>"Doc," he said, "I can't stand it no longer. I'm going out and
try to get him back here. And God forgive me for it."</p>

<p>He left the room, slamming the door behind him, and then he
stamped down the hall as if he were trying to make a companion out
of his noise. Doctor Randall Byrne sat down to put his thoughts in
order. He began at the following point: "The physical fact is not;
only the immaterial is." But before he had carried very far his
deductions from this premise, he caught the neighing of a horse
near the house; so he went to the window and threw it open. At the
same time he heard the rattle of galloping hoofs, and then he saw a
horseman riding furiously into the heart of the wind. Almost at
once the rider was lost from sight.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap7" name="chap7">7. JERRY STRANN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The wrath of the Lord seems less terrible when it
is localised, and the world at large gave thanks daily that the
range of Jerry Strann was limited to the Three B's. As everyone in
the mountain-desert knows, the Three B's are Bender, Buckskin, and
Brownsville; they make the points of a loose triangle that is cut
with canyons and tumbled with mountains, and that triangle was the
chosen stamping ground of Jerry Strann. Jerry was not born in the
region of the Three B's and why it should have been chosen
specially by him was matter which the inhabitants could not puzzle
out; but they felt that for their sins the Lord had probably put
his wrath among them in the form of Jerry Strann.</p>

<p>He was only twenty-four, this Jerry, but he was already grown
into a proverb. Men of the Three B's reckoned their conversational
dates by the visits of the youth; if a storm hung over the
mountains someone might remark: "It looks like Jerry Strann is
coming," and such a remark was always received in gloomy silence;
mothers had been known to hush their children by chanting: "Jerry
Strann will get you if you don't watch out." Yet he was not an ogre
with a red knife between his teeth. He stood at exactly the perfect
romantic height; he was just six feet tall; he was as graceful as a
young cotton-wood in a windstorm and he was as strong and tough as
the roots of the mesquite. He was one of those rare men who are
beautiful without being unmanly. His face was modelled with the
care a Praxiteles would lavish on a Phoebus. His brown hair was
thick and dark and every touch of wind stirred it, and his hazel
eyes were brilliant with an enduring light&mdash;the
inextinguishable joy of life.</p>

<p>Consider that there was no malice in Jerry Strann. But he loved
strife as the young Apollo loved strife&mdash;or a pure-blooded
bull terrier. He fought with distinction and grace and abandon and
was perfectly willing to use fists or knives or guns at the
pleasure of the other contracting party. In another age, with
armour and a golden chain and spurs, Jerry Strann would have
been&mdash;but why think of that? Swords are not forty-fives, and
the Twentieth Century is not the Thirteenth. He was, in fact, born
just six hundred years too late. From his childhood he had thirsted
for battle as other children thirst for milk: and now he rode
anything on hoofs and threw a knife like a Mexican&mdash;with
either hand&mdash;and at short range he did snap shooting with two
revolvers that made rifle experts sick at heart.</p>

<p>However, the men of the Three B's, as everyone understands, are
not gentle or long-enduring, and you will wonder why this young
destroyer was allowed to range at large so long. There was a vital
reason. Up in the mountains lived Mac Strann, the hermit-trapper,
who hated everything in the wide world except his young brother,
the beautiful, wild, and sunny Jerry Strann. And Mac Strann loved
his brother as much as he hated everything else; it is impossible
to state it more strongly. It was not long before the men of the
Three B's discovered how Mac Strann felt about his brother. After
Jerry's famous Hallowe'en party in Buckskin, for instance,
Williamson, McKenna, and Rath started out to rid the country of the
disturber. They went out to hunt him as men go out to hunt a wild
mustang. And they caught him and bent him down&mdash;those three
stark men&mdash;and he lay in bed for a month; but before the month
was over Mac Strann came down from his mountain and went to
Buckskin and gathered Williamson and McKenna and Rath in one public
place. And when the morning came Williamson and McKenna and Rath
had left this vale of tears and Mac Strann was back on his
mountain. He was not even arrested. For there was a devilish
cunning about the fellow and he made his victims, without
exception, attack him first; then he destroyed them, suddenly and
surely, and retreated to his lair. Things like this happened once
or twice and then the men of the Three B's understood that it was
not wise to lay plots for Jerry Strann. They accepted him, as I
have said before, as men accept the wrath of God.</p>

<p>Let it not be thought that Jerry Strann was a solitary like his
brother. When he went out for a frolic the young men of the
community gathered around him, for Jerry paid all scores and the
red-eye flowed in his path like wine before the coming of Bacchus;
where Jerry went there was never a dull moment, and young men love
action. So it happened that when he rode into Brownsville this day
he was the leader of a cavalcade. Rumour rode before them, and
doors were locked and windows were darkened, and men sat in the
darkness within with their guns across their knees. For Brownsville
lay at the extreme northern tip of the triangle and it was rarely
visited by Jerry; and it is well established that men fear the
unfamiliar more than the known.</p>

<p>As has been said, Jerry headed the train of revellers, partially
because it was most unwise to cut in ahead of Jerry and partially
because there was not a piece of horseflesh in the Three B's which
could outfoot his chestnut. It was a gelding out of the loins of
the north wind and sired by the devil himself, and its spirit was
one with the spirit of Jerry Strann, perhaps because they both
served one master. The cavalcade came with a crash of racing hoofs
in a cloud of dust. But in the middle of the street Jerry raised
his right arm stiffly overhead with a whoop and brought his
chestnut to a sliding stop; the cloud of dust rolled lazily on
ahead. The young men gathered quickly around the leader, and there
was silence as they waited for him to speak&mdash;a silence broken
only by the wheezing of the horses, and the stench of sweating
horseflesh was in every man's nostrils.</p>

<p>"Who owns that hoss?" asked Jerry Strann, and pointed.</p>

<p>He had stopped just opposite O'Brien's hotel, store, blacksmith
shop, and saloon, and by the hitching rack was a black stallion.
Now, there are some men who carry tidings of their inward strength
stamped on their foreheads and written in their eyes. In times of
crises crowds will turn to such men and follow them as soldiers
follow a captain, for it is patent at a glance that this is a man
of men. It is likewise true that there are horses which stand out
among their fellows, and this was such a horse. He was such a
creature that, if he had been led to a barrier, the entire crowd at
the race track would rise as one man and say: "What is that horse?"
There were points in which some critics would find fault; most of
the men of the mountain-desert, for instance, would have said that
the animal was too lightly and delicately limbed for long
endurance; but as the man of men bears the stamp of his greatness
in his forehead and his eyes, so it was with the black stallion.
When the thunder of the cavalcade had rushed upon him down the
street, he had turned with catlike grace and raised his head to
see, and his forehead and his eyes arrested Jerry Strann like a
levelled rifle. Looking at that proud head one forgot the body of
the horse, the symmetry of curves exquisite beyond the sculptor's
dream, the arching neck and the steel muscles; one was only
conscious of the great spirit. In Human beings we refer to it as
"personality."</p>

<p>After a little pause, seeing that no one offered a suggestion as
to the identity of the owner, Strann said, softly: "That hoss is
mine."</p>

<p>It caused a stir in the crowd of his followers. In the
mountain-desert one may deal lightly with a man's wife and lift a
random cow or two and settle the score, at need, with a snug
"forty-five" chunk of lead. But with horses it is different. A
horse in the mountain-desert lies outside of all laws&mdash;and
above all laws. It is greater than honour and dearer than love, and
when a man's horse is taken from him the men of the desert gather
together and hunt the thief whether it be a day or whether it be a
month, and when they have reached him they shoot him like a dog and
leave his flesh to the buzzards and his bones to the merciless
stars. For all of this there is a reason. But Jerry Strann swung
from his mount, tossed the reins over the head of the chestnut, and
walked towards the black with hungry eyes. He was careless, also,
and venturing too close&mdash;the black whirled with his sudden,
catlike agility, and two black hoofs lashed within a hair's breadth
of the man's shoulder. There was a shout from the crowd, but Jerry
Strann stepped back and smiled so that his teeth showed.</p>

<p>"Boys," he said, but he was really speaking to himself, "there's
nothing in the world I want as bad as I want that hoss. Nothing!
I'm going to buy him; where's the owner?"</p>

<p>"Don't look like a hoss a man would want to sell, Jerry," came a
suggestion from the cavalcade, who had dismounted and now pressed
behind their leader.</p>

<p>Jerry favoured the speaker with another of his enigmatic smiles:
"Oh," he chuckled, "he'll sell, all right! Maybe he's inside. You
gents stick out here and watch for him; I'll step inside."</p>

<p>And he strode through the swinging doors of the saloon.</p>

<p>It was a dull time of day for O'Brien, so he sat with his feet
on the edge of the bar and sipped a tall glass of beer; he looked
up at the welcome click of the doors, however, and then was
instantly on his feet. The good red went out of his face and the
freckles over his nose stood out like ink marks.</p>

<p>"There's a black hoss outside," said Jerry, "that I'm going to
buy. Where's the owner?"</p>

<p>"Have a drink," said the bartender, and he forced an amiable
smile.</p>

<p>"I got business on my hands, not drinking," said Jerry
Strann.</p>

<p>"Lost your chestnut?" queried O'Brien in concern.</p>

<p>"The chestnut was all right until I seen the black. And now he
ain't a hoss at all. Where's the gent I want?"</p>

<p>The bartender had fenced for time as long as possible.</p>

<p>"Over there," he said, and pointed.</p>

<p>It was a slender fellow sitting at a table in a corner of the
long room, his sombrero pushed back on his head. He was playing
solitaire and his back was towards Jerry Strann, who now made a
brief survey, hitched his cartridge belt, and approached the
stranger with a grin. The man did not turn; he continued to lay
down his cards with monotonous regularity, and while he was doing
it he said in the gentlest voice that had ever reached the ear of
Jerry Strann: "Better stay where you are, stranger. My dog don't
like you."</p>

<p>And Jerry Strann perceived, under the shadow of the table, a
blacker shadow, huge and formless in the gloom, and two spots of
incandescent green twinkling towards him. He stopped; he even made
a step back; and then he heard a stifled chuckle from the
bartender.</p>

<p>If it had not been for that untimely mirth of O'Brien's probably
nothing of what followed would have passed into the history of the
Three B's.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap8" name="chap8">8. THE GIFT-HORSE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"Your dog is your own dog," remarked Jerry Strann,
still to the back of the card-laying stranger, "but this ain't your
back-yard. Keep your eye on him, or I'll fix him so he won't need
watching!"</p>

<p>So saying he made another step forward, and it brought a snarl
from the dog; not one of those high-whining noises, but a deep
guttural that sounded like indrawn breath. The gun of Jerry Strann
leaped into his hand.</p>

<p>"Bart," said the gentle-voiced stranger, "lie down and don't
talk." And he turned in his chair, pulled his hat straight, and
looked mildly upon the gunman. An artist would have made much of
that picture, for there was in this man, as in Strann, a singular
portion of beauty. It was not, however, free from objection, for he
had not the open manliness of the larger of the two. Indeed, a
feminine grace and softness marked him; his wrists were as round as
a girl's, and his hands as slender and as delicately finished.
Whether it be the white-hot sun of summer or the hurricane snows of
winter, the climate of the mountain-desert roughens the skin, and
it cuts away spare flesh, hewing out the face in angles; but with
this man there were no rough edges, but all was smoothed over and
rounded with painful care, as if nature had concentrated in that
birth to show what she could do. Such fine workmanship, perhaps,
would be appreciated more by women than by men; for men like a
certain weight and bulk of bone and muscle&mdash;whereas this
fellow seemed as light of body as he was of hand. He sat now
watching Strann with the utmost gravity. He had very large brown
eyes of a puzzling quality; perhaps that was because there seemed
to be no thought behind them, and one caught the mystery and the
wistfulness of some animals from a glance at him.</p>

<p>The effect of that glance on Strann was to make him grin again,
and he at once banished the frown from his forehead and put away
his gun; the big dog had slunk deeper into the shadow and closer to
his master.</p>

<p>"I'm Strann. Maybe you've heard of me."</p>

<p>"My name is Barry," said the other. "I'm sorry that I haven't
heard of you before."</p>

<p>And the sound of his voice made Jerry Strann grin again; it was
such a low, soft voice with the velvet of a young girl's tone in
it; moreover, the brown eyes seemed to apologise for the ignorance
concerning Strann's name.</p>

<p>"You got a hoss out in front."</p>

<p>A nod of agreement.</p>

<p>"What's your price?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"No price? Look here," argued Strann, "everything's got a price,
and I got to have that hoss, understand? <i>Got</i> to! I ain't
bargaining. I won't try to beat you down. You just set a figger and
I'll cover it. I guess that's square!"</p>

<p>"He ain't a gentle hoss," said Barry. "Maybe you wouldn't like
him.'</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right about being gentle," chuckled Strann. Then
he checked his mirth and stared piercingly at the other to make out
if there were a secret mockery. It could not, however, be possible.
The eyes were as gravely apologetic as ever. He continued: "I seen
the hell-fire in him. That's what stopped me like a bullet. I like
'em that way. Much rather have 'em with a fight. Well, let's have
your price. Hey, O'Brien, trot out your red-eye; I'm going to do
some business here!"</p>

<p>O'Brien came hastily, with drinks, and while they waited Strann
queried politely: "Belong around these parts?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the other softly.</p>

<p>"No? Where you come from?"</p>

<p>"Over there," said Barry, and waved a graceful hand towards half
the points of the compass.</p>

<p>"H-m-m!" muttered Strann, and once more he bent a keen gaze upon
his companion. The drinks were now placed before them. "Here," he
concluded, "is to the black devil outside!" And he swallowed the
liquor at a gulp, but as he replaced the empty glass on the table
he observed, with breathless amazement, that the whiskey glass of
the stranger was still full; he had drunk his chaser!</p>

<p>"Now, by God!" said Strann in a ringing voice, and struck a
heavy hand upon the top of the table. He regained his control,
however, instantly. "Now about that price!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what horses are worth," replied Barry.</p>

<p>"To start, then&mdash;five hundred bucks in cold
cash&mdash;gold!&mdash;for your&mdash;what's his name?"</p>

<p>"Satan."</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"Satan."</p>

<p>"H-m-m!" murmured Strann again. "Five hundred for Satan, then.
How about it?"</p>

<p>"If you can ride him," began the stranger.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell," smiled Strann with a large and careless gesture,
"I'll <i>ride</i> him, all right."</p>

<p>"Then I would let you take him for nothing," concluded
Barry.</p>

<p>"You'd&mdash;what?" said Strann. Then he rose slowly from his
chair and shouted; instantly the swinging doors broke open and a
throng of faces appeared at the gap. "Boys, this gent here is going
to give me the black&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;if I can ride him!" He
turned back on Barry. "They've heard it," he concluded, "and this
bargain is going to stick just this way. If your hoss can throw me
the deal's off. Eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," nodded the brown-eyed man.</p>

<p>"What's the idea?" asked one of Jerry's followers as the latter
stepped through the doors of the saloon onto the street.</p>

<p>"I dunno," said Jerry. "That gent looks kind of simple; but it
ain't my fault if he made a rotten bargain. Here, you!"</p>

<p>And he seized the bridle-reins of the black stallion. Speed,
lightning speed, was what saved him, for the instant his fingers
touched the leather Satan twisted his head and snapped like an
angry dog. The teeth clicked beside Strann's shoulder as he leaped
back. He laughed savagely.</p>

<p>"That'll be took out of him," he announced, "and damned
quick!"</p>

<p>Here the voice of Barry was heard, saying: "I'll help you mount,
Mr. Strann." And he edged his way through the little crowd until he
stood at the head of the stallion.</p>

<p>"Look out!" warned Strann in real alarm, "or he'll take your
head off!"</p>

<p>But Barry was already beside his horse, and, with his back
towards those vicious teeth, he drew the reins over its head. As
for the stallion, it pricked one ear forward and then the other,
and nuzzled the man's shoulder confidingly. There was a liberal
chorus of astonished oaths from the gathering.</p>

<p>"I'll hold his head while you get on," suggested Barry, turning
his mild eyes upon Strann again.</p>

<p>"Well," muttered the big man, "may I be eternally damned!" He
added: "All right. Hold his head, and I'll ride him without pulling
leather. Is that square?"</p>

<p>Barry nodded absently. His slender fingers were patting the
velvet nose of the stallion and he was talking to it in an
affectionate undertone&mdash;meaningless words, perhaps, such as a
mother uses to soothe a child. When Strann set his foot in the
stirrup and gathered up the reins the black horse cringed and
shuddered; it was not a pleasant thing to see; it was like a dog
crouching under the suspended whip. It was worse than that; it was
almost the horror of a man who shivers at the touch of an unclean
animal. There was not a sound from the crowd, and every grin was
wiped out. Jerry Strann swung into the saddle lightly.</p>

<p>There he sat, testing the stirrups. They were too short by
inches but he refused to have them lengthened. He poised his quirt
and tugged his hat lower over his eyes.</p>

<p>"Turn him loose!" he shouted. "Hey!"</p>

<p>And his shrill yell went down the street and the echoes sent it
barking back from wall to wall; Barry stepped back from the head of
the black. But for an instant the horse did not stir. He was
trembling violently, but his blazing eyes were fixed upon the face
of his owner. Barry raised his hand.</p>

<p>And then it happened. It was like the release of a coiled
watch-spring; the black whirled as a top spins and Strann sagged
far to the left; before he could recover the stallion was away in a
flash, like a racer leaving the barrier and reaching full speed in
almost a stride. Not far&mdash;hardly the breadth of the
street&mdash;before he pitched up in a long leap as if to clear a
barrier, landed stiff-legged with a sickening jar, whirled again
like a spinning top, and darted straight back. And Jerry Strann
pulled leather&mdash;with might and main&mdash;but the short
stirrups were against him, and above all the suddenness of the
start had taken him off guard for all his readiness. When the
stallion dropped stiff-legged Jerry was thrown forward and an
unlucky left foot jarred loose from the stirrup; and when the horse
whirled Strann was flung from the saddle. It was a clean fall. He
twisted over in the air as he fell and landed in deep dust. The
black stallion had reached his master and now he turned, in that
same catlike manner, and watched with pricking ears as Strann
dragged himself up from the dust.</p>

<p>There was no shout of laughter&mdash;no cheer for that fall, and
without a smile they watched Strann returning. Big O'Brien had seen
from his open door and now he laid a hand on the shoulder of one of
the men and whispered at his ear: "There's going to be
trouble&mdash;bad trouble, Billy. Go for Fatty Matthews&mdash;he's
a deputy marshal now&mdash;and get him here as quick as you can.
Run!"</p>

<p>The other spared time for a last glance at Strann and then
hurried down the street.</p>

<p>Now, a man who can lose and smile is generally considered the
most graceful of failures, but the smile of Jerry Strann as he
walked slowly back worried his followers.</p>

<p>"We all hit dust sometime," he philosophized. "But one try don't
prove nothin'. I ain't near through with that hoss!"</p>

<p>Barry turned to Strann. If there had been mockery in his eyes or
a smile on his lips as he faced Jerry there would have been a gun
play on the spot; but, instead, the brown eyes were as dumbly
apologetic as ever.</p>

<p>"We didn't talk about two tries," he observed.</p>

<p>"We talk about it now," said Strann.</p>

<p>There was one man in the crowd a little too old to be dangerous
and therefore there was one man who was in a position to speak
openly to Strann. It was big O'Brien.</p>

<p>"Jerry, you named your game and made your play and lost. I guess
you ain't going to turn up a hard loser. Nobody plays twice for the
same pot."</p>

<p>The hazel eye of Strann was grey with anguish of the spirit as
he looked from O'Brien to the crowd and from the crowd to Satan,
and from Satan to his meek-eyed owner. Nowhere was there a defiant
eye or a glint of scorn on which he could wreak his wrath. He stood
poised in his anger for the space of a breath; then, in the sharp
struggle, his better nature conquered.</p>

<p>"Come on in, all of you," he called. "We'll liquor, and forget
this."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap9" name="chap9">9. BATTLE LIGHT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">O'Brien pressed close to Barry.</p>

<p>"Partner," he said rapidly, "you're clear now&mdash;you're clear
of more hell that you ever dream. Now climb that hoss of yours and
feed him leather till you get clear of Brownsville&mdash;and if I
was you I'd never come within a day's ride of the Three B's
again."</p>

<p>The mild, brown eyes widened.</p>

<p>"I don't like crowds," murmured Barry.</p>

<p>"You're wise, kid," grinned the bartender&mdash;"a hell of a lot
wiser than you know right now. On your way!"</p>

<p>And he turned to follow the crowd into the saloon. But Jerry
Strann stood at the swinging doors, watching, and he saw Barry
linger behind.</p>

<p>"Are you coming?" he called.</p>

<p>"I got an engagement," answered the meek voice.</p>

<p>"You got another engagement here," mocked Strann.
"Understand?"</p>

<p>The other hesitated for an instant, and then sighed deeply. "I
suppose I'll stay," he murmured, and walked into the bar. Jerry
Strann was smiling in the way that showed his teeth. As Barry
passed he said softly: "I see we ain't going to have no trouble,
you and me!" and he moved to clap his strong hand on the shoulder
of the smaller man. Oddly enough, the hand missed, for Barry
swerved from beneath it as a wolf swerves from the shadow of a
falling branch. No perceptible effort&mdash;no sudden start of
tensed muscles, but a movement so smooth that it was almost
unnoticeable. But the hand of Strann fell through thin air.</p>

<p>"You're quick," he said. "If you was as quick with your hands as
you are with your feet&mdash;"</p>

<p>Barry paused and the melancholy brown eyes dwelt on the face of
Strann.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell!" snorted the other, and turned on his heel to the
bar. "Drink up!" he commanded.</p>

<p>A shout and a snarl from the further end of the room.</p>

<p>"A wolf, by God!" yelled one of the men.</p>

<p>The owner of the animal made his way with unobtrusive swiftness
the length of the room and stood between the dog and a man who
fingered the butt of his gun nervously.</p>

<p>"He won't hurt you none," murmured that softly assuring
voice.</p>

<p>"The hell he wont!" responded the other. "He took a pass at my
leg just now and dam' near took it off. Got teeth like the blades
of a pocket-knife!"</p>

<p>"You're on a cold trail, Sam," broke in one of the others. "That
ain't any wolf. Look at him now!"</p>

<p>The big, shaggy animal had slunk to the feet of his master and
with head abased stared furtively up into Barry's face. A gesture
served as sufficient command, and he slipped shadow-like into the
corner and crouched with his head on his paws and the incandescent
green of his eyes glimmering; Barry sat down in a chair nearby.</p>

<p>O'Brien was happily spinning bottles and glasses the length of
the bar; there was the chiming of glass and the rumble of contented
voices.</p>

<p>"Red-eye all 'round," said the loud voice of Jerry Strann, "but
there's one out. Who's out? Oh, it's <i>him</i>. Hey O'Brien,
lemonade for the lady."</p>

<p>It brought a laugh, a deep, good-natured laugh, and then a
chorus of mockery; but Barry stepped unconfused to the bar,
accepted the glass of lemonade, and when the others downed their
fire-water, he sipped his drink thoughtfully. Outside, the wind had
risen, and it shook the hotel and carried a score of faint voices
as it whirred around corners and through cracks. Perhaps it was one
of those voices which made the big dog lift its head from its paws
and whine softly! surely it was something he heard which caused
Barry to straighten at the bar and cant his head slightly to one
side&mdash;but, as certainly, no one else in the barroom heard it.
Barry set down his glass.</p>

<p>"Mr. Strann?" he called.</p>

<p>And the gentle voice carried faintly down through the uproar of
the bar.</p>

<p>"Sister wants to speak to you," suggested O'Brien to Strann.</p>

<p>"Well?" roared the latter, "what d'you want?"</p>

<p>The others were silent to listen; and they smiled in
anticipation.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, much," said the musical voice, "I think I'll
be moving along."</p>

<p>There is an obscure little devil living in all of us. It makes
the child break his own toys; it makes the husband strike the
helpless wife; it makes the man beat the cringing, whining dog. The
greatest of American writers has called it the Imp of the Perverse.
And that devil came in Jerry Strann and made his heart small and
cold. If he had been by nature the bully and the ruffian there
would have been no point in all that followed, but the heart of
Jerry Strann was ordinarily as warm as the yellow sunshine itself;
and it was a common saying in the Three B's that Jerry Strann would
take from a child what he would not endure from a mountain-lion.
Women loved Jerry Strann, and children would crowd about his knees,
but this day the small demon was in him.</p>

<p>"You want to be moving along" mimicked the devil in Jerry
Strann. "Well, you wait a while. I ain't through with you yet.
Maybe&mdash;" he paused and searched his mind. "You've given me a
fall, and maybe you can give the rest of us&mdash;a laugh!"</p>

<p>The chuckle of appreciation went up the bar and down it
again.</p>

<p>"I want to ask you," went on the devil in Jerry Strann, "where
you got your hoss?"</p>

<p>"He was running wild," came the gentle answer. "So I took a
walk, one day, and brought him in."</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>"Maybe," grinned the big man, "you creased him?"</p>

<p>For it is one of the most difficult things in the world to
capture a wild horse, and some hunters, in their desperation at
seeing the wonderful animals escape, have tried to "crease" them.
That is, they strive to shoot so that the bullet will barely graze
the top of the animal's vertebrae, just behind the ears, stunning
the horse and making it helpless for the capture. But necessarily
such shots are made from a distance, and little short of a miracle
is needed to make the bullet strike true&mdash;for a fraction of an
inch too low means death. So another laugh of appreciation ran
around the barroom at the mention of creasing.</p>

<p>"No," answered Barry, "I went out with a halter and after a
while Satan got used to me and followed me home."</p>

<p>They waited only long enough to draw deep breath; then came a
long yell of delight. But the obscure devil was growing stronger
and stronger in Strann. He beat on the bar until he got silence.
Then he leaned over to meet the eyes of Barry.</p>

<p>"That," he remarked through his teeth, "is a
damned&mdash;lie!"</p>

<p>There is only one way of answering that word in the
mountain-desert, and Barry did not take it. The melancholy brown
eyes widened; he sighed, and raising his glass of lemonade sipped
it slowly. Came a sick silence in the barroom. Men turned their
eyes towards each other and then flashed them away again. It is not
good that one who has the eyes and the tongue of a man should take
water from another&mdash;even from a Jerry Strann. And even Jerry
Strann withdrew his eyes slowly from his prey, and shuddered; the
sight of the most grisly death is not so horrible as cowardice.</p>

<p>And the devil which was still strong in Strann made him look
about for a new target; Barry was removed from all danger by an
incredible barrier. He found that new target at once, for his
glance reached to the corner of the room and found there the
greenish, glimmering eyes of the dog. He smote upon the bar.</p>

<p>"Is this a damned kennel?" he shouted. "Do I got to drink in a
barnyard? What's the dog doin' here?"</p>

<p>And he caught up the heavy little whiskey glass and hurled it at
the crouching dog. It thudded heavily, but it brought no yelp of
pain; instead, a black thunderbolt leaped from the corner and
lunged down the room. It was the silence of the attack that made it
terrible, and Strann cursed and pulled his gun. He could never have
used it. He was a whole half second too late, but before the dog
sprang a voice cut in: "Bart!"</p>

<p>It checked the animal in its very leap; it landed on the floor
and slid on stiffly extended legs to the feet of Strann.</p>

<p>"Bart!" rang the voice again.</p>

<p>And the beast, flattening to the floor, crawled backwards, inch
by inch; it was slavering, and there was a ravening madness in its
eyes.</p>

<p>"Look at it!" cried Strann. "By God, it's mad!"</p>

<p>And he raised his gun to draw the bead.</p>

<p>"Wait!" called the same voice which had checked the spring of
the dog. Surely it could not have come from the lips of Barry. It
held a resonance of chiming metal; it was not loud, but it carried
like a brazen bell. "Don't do it, Strann!"</p>

<p>And it came to every man in the barroom that it was unhealthy to
stand between the two men at that instant; a sudden path opened
from Barry to Strann.</p>

<p>"Bart!" came the command again. "Heel!"</p>

<p>The dog obeyed with a slinking swiftness; Jerry Strann put up
his gun and smiled.</p>

<p>"I don't take a start on no man," he announced quite pleasantly.
"I don't need to. But&mdash;you yaller hearted houn'&mdash;get out
from between. When I make my draw I'm goin' to kill that damn
wolf."</p>

<p>Now, the fighting face of Jerry Strann was well known in the
Three B's, and it was something for men to remember until they died
in a peaceful bed. Yet there was not a glance, from the bystanders,
for Strann. They stood back against the wall, flattening
themselves, and they stared, fascinated, at the slender stranger.
Not that his face had grown ugly by a sudden metamorphosis. It was
more beautiful than ever, for the man was smiling. It was his eyes
which held them. Behind the brown a light was growing, a yellow and
unearthly glimmer which one felt might be seen on the darkest
night.</p>

<p>There was none of the coward in Jerry Strann. He looked full
into that yellow, glimmering, changing light&mdash;he looked
steadily&mdash;and a strange feeling swept over him. No, it was not
fear. Long experience had taught him that there was not another man
in the Three B's, with the exception of his own terrible brother,
who could get a gun out of the leather faster than he, but now it
seemed to Jerry Strann that he was facing something more than
mortal speed and human strength and surety. He could not tell in
what the feeling was based. But it was a giant, dim foreboding
holding dominion over other men's lives, and it sent a train of
chilly-weakness through his blood.</p>

<p>"It's a habit of mine," said Jerry Strann, "to kill mad dogs
when I see 'em." And he smiled again.</p>

<p>They stood for another long instant, facing each other. It was
plain that every muscle in Strann's body was growing tense; the
very smile was frozen on his lips. When he moved, at last, it was a
convulsive jerk of his arm, and it was said, afterward, that his
gun was all clear of the leather before the calm stranger stirred.
No eye followed what happened. Can the eye follow such speed as the
cracking lash of a whip?</p>

<p>There was only one report. The forefinger of Strann did not
touch his trigger, but the gun slipped down and dangled loosely
from his hand. He made a pace forward with his smile grown to an
idiotic thing and a patch of red sprang out in the centre of his
breast. Then he lurched headlong to the floor.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap10" name="chap10">10. "SWEET ADELINE"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Fatty Matthews came panting through the doors. He
was one of those men who have a leisurely build and a purely
American desire for action; so that he was always hurrying and
always puffing. If he mounted a horse, sweat started out from every
pore; if he swallowed a glass of red-eye he breathed hard
thereafter. Yet he was capable of great and sustained exertions, as
many and many a man in the Three B's could testify. He was ashamed
of his fat. Imagine the soul of a Bald Eagle in the body of a
Poland China sow and you begin to have some idea of Fatty Matthews.
Fat filled his boots as with water and he made a "squnching" sound
when he walked; fat rolled along his jowls; fat made his very
forehead flabby; fat almost buried his eyes. But nothing could
conceal the hawk-line of his nose or the gleam of those half-buried
eyes. His hair was short-cropped, grey, and stood on end like
bristles, and he was in the habit of using his panting breath in
humming&mdash;for that concealed the puffing. So Fatty Matthews
came through the doors and his little, concealed eyes darted from
face to face. Then he kneeled beside Strann.</p>

<p>He was humming as he opened Jerry's shirt; he was humming as he
pulled from his bag&mdash;for Fatty was almost as much doctor as he
was marshal, cowpuncher, miner, and gambler&mdash;a roll of cotton
and another roll of bandages. The crowd grouped around him,
fascinated, and at his directions some of them brought water and
others raised and turned the body while the marshal made the
bandages; Jerry Strann was unconscious. Fatty Matthews began to
intersperse talk in his humming.</p>

<p>"You was plugged from in front&mdash;my beauty&mdash;was you?"
grunted Fatty, and then running the roll of bandage around the
wounded man's chest he hummed a bar of:</p>

<p>"Sweet Adeline, my Adeline,</p>

<p>At night, dear heart, for you I pine."</p>

<p>"Was Jerry lookin' the other way when he was spotted?" asked
Fatty of the bystanders. "O'Brien, you seen it?"</p>

<p>O'Brien cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"I didn't see nothin'," he said mildly, and began to mop his
bar, which was already polished beyond belief.</p>

<p>"Well," muttered Fatty Matthews, "all these birds get it. And
Jerry was some overdue. Lew, you seen it?"</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"Some drunken bum do it?"</p>

<p>Lew leaned to the ear of the kneeling marshal and whispered
briefly. Fatty opened his eyes and cursed until his panting forced
him to break off and hum.</p>

<p>"Beat him to the draw?" he gasped at length.</p>

<p>"Jerry's gun was clean out before the stranger made a move,"
asserted Lew.</p>

<p>"It ain't possible," murmured the deputy, and hummed softly:</p>

<p class="poem">"In all my dreams your fair face beams."</p>

<p>He added sharply, as he finished the bandaging: "Where'd he head
for?"</p>

<p>"No place," answered Lew. "He just now went out the door."</p>

<p>The deputy swore again, but he added, enlightened; "Going to
plead self-defense, eh?"</p>

<p>Big O'Brien leaned over the bar.</p>

<p>"Listen, Fatty," he said earnestly, "There ain't no doubt of it.
Jerry had his war-paint on. He tried to kill this feller Barry's
wolf."</p>

<p>"Wolf?" cut in the deputy marshal.</p>

<p>"Dog, I guess," qualified the bartender. "I dunno. Anyway, Jerry
made all the leads; this Barry simply done the finishing. I say,
don't put this Barry under arrest. You want to keep him here for
Mac Strann."</p>

<p>"That's my business," growled Fatty. "Hey, half a dozen of you
gents. Hook on to Jerry and take him up to a room. I'll be with you
in a minute."</p>

<p>And while his directions were being obeyed he trotted heavily up
the length of the barroom and out the swinging doors. Outside, he
found only one man, and in the act of mounting a black horse; the
deputy marshal made straight for that man until a huge black dog
appeared from nowhere blocking his path. It was a silent dog, but
its teeth and eyes said enough to stop Fatty in full career.</p>

<p>"Are you Barry?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That's me. Come here, Bart."</p>

<p>The big dog backed to the other side of the horse without
shifting his eyes from the marshal. The latter gingerly approached
the rider, who sat perfectly at ease in the saddle; most apparently
he was in no haste to leave.</p>

<p>"Barry," said the deputy, "don't make no play when I tell you
who I am; I don't mean you no harm, but my name's Matthews,
and&mdash;" he drew back the flap of his vest enough to show the
glitter of his badge of office. All the time his little beady eyes
watched Barry with bird-like intentness. The rider made not a move.
And now Matthews noted more in detail the feminine slenderness of
the man and the large, placid eyes. He stepped closer and dropped a
confidential hand on the pommel of the saddle.</p>

<p>"Son," he muttered, "I hear you made a clean play inside. Now, I
know Strann and his way. He was in wrong. There ain't a doubt of
it, and if I held you, you'd get clear on self-defense. So I ain't
going to lay a hand on you. You're free: but one thing more. You
cut off there&mdash;see?&mdash;and bear away north from the Three
B's. You got a hoss that <i>is</i>, and believe me, you'll need him
before you're through." He lowered his voice and his eyes bulged
with the terror of his tidings: "Feed him the leather; ride to beat
hell; never stop while your hoss can raise a trot; and then slide
off your hoss and get another. Son, in three days Mac Strann'll be
on your trail!"</p>

<p>He stepped back and waved his arms.</p>

<p>"Now, <i>vamos!</i>"</p>

<p>The black stallion flicked back its ears and winced from the
outflung hands, but the rider remained imperturbed.</p>

<p>"I never heard of Mac Strann," said Barry.</p>

<p>"You never heard of Mac Strann?" echoed the other.</p>

<p>"But I'd like to meet him," said Barry.</p>

<p>The deputy marshal blinked his eyes rapidly, as though he needed
to clear his vision.</p>

<p>"Son," he said hoarsely. "I c'n see you're game. But don't make
a fool play. If Mac Strann gets you, he'll California you like a
yearling. You won't have no chance. You've done for Jerry, there
ain't a doubt of that, but Jerry to Mac is like a tame cat to a
mountain-lion. Lad, I c'n see you're a stranger to these parts, but
ask me your questions and I'll tell you the best way to go."</p>

<p>Barry slipped from the saddle.</p>

<p>He said: "I'd like to know the best place to put up my
hoss."</p>

<p>The deputy marshal was speechless.</p>

<p>"But I s'pose," went on Barry, "I can stable him over there
behind the hotel."</p>

<p>Matthews pushed off his sombrero and rubbed his short fingers
through his hair. Anger and amazement still choked him, but he
controlled himself by a praiseworthy effort.</p>

<p>"Barry," he said, "I don't make you out. Maybe you figure to
wait till Mac Strann gets to town before you leave; maybe you think
your hoss can outrun anything on four feet. And maybe it can. But
listen to me: Mac Strann ain't fast on a trail, but the point about
him is that he never leaves it! You can go through rain and over
rocks, but you can't never shake Mac Strann&mdash;not once he gets
the wind of you."</p>

<p>"Thanks," returned the gentle-voiced stranger. "I guess maybe
he'll be worth meeting."</p>

<p>And so saying he turned on his heel and walked calmly towards
the big stables behind the hotel and at his heels followed the
black dog and the black horse. As for deputy marshal Matthews, he
moistened his lips to whistle, but when he pursed them, not a sound
came. He turned at length into the barroom and as he walked his eye
was vacant. He was humming brokenly:</p>

<p class="poem">"Sweet Adeline, my Adeline,<br>
At night, dear heart, for you I pine."</p>

<p>Inside, he took firm hold upon the bar with both pudgy
hands.</p>

<p>"O'Brien," he said, "red-eye."</p>

<p>He pushed away the small glass which the bartender spun towards
him and seized in its place a mighty water-tumbler.</p>

<p>"O'Brien," he explained, "I need strength, not encouragement."
And filling the glass nearly to the brim he downed the huge potion
at a single draught.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="chap11" name="chap11">11. THE BUZZARD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Most animals have their human counterparts, and in
that room where Jerry Strann had fallen a whimsical observer might
have termed Jerry, with his tawny head, the lion, and O'Brien
behind the bar, a shaggy bear, and the deputy marshal a wolverine,
fat but dangerous, and here stood a man as ugly and hardened as a
desert cayuse, and there was Dan Barry, sleek and supple as a
panther; but among the rest this whimsical observer must have
noticed a fellow of prodigious height and negligible breadth, a
structure of sinews and bones that promised to rattle in the wind,
a long, narrow head, a nose like a beak, tiny eyes set close
together and shining like polished buttons, and a vast Adam's apple
that rolled up and down the scraggy throat. He might have done for
the spirit of Famine in an old play; but every dweller of the
mountain-desert would have found an apter expression by calling him
the buzzard of the scene. Through his prodigious ugliness he was
known far and wide as "Haw-Haw" Langley; for on occasion Langley
laughed, and his laughter was an indescribable sound that lay
somewhere between the braying of a mule and the cawing of a crow.
But Haw-Haw Langley was usually silent, and he would sit for hours
without words, twisting his head and making little pecking motions
as his eyes fastened on face after face. All the bitterness of the
mountain-desert was in Haw-Haw Langley; if his body looked like a
buzzard, his soul was the soul of the vulture itself, and therefore
he had followed the courses of Jerry Strann up and down the range.
He stuffed his gorge with the fragments of his leader's food; he
fed his soul with the dangers which Jerry Strann met and
conquered.</p>

<p>In the barroom Haw-Haw Langley had stood turning his sharp
little eyes from Jerry Strann to Dan Barry, and from Dan Barry back
to Strann; and when the shot was fired something like a grin
twisted his thin lips; and when the spot of red glowed on the
breast of the staggering man, the eyes of Haw-Haw blazed as if with
the reflection of a devouring fire. Afterwards he lingered for a
few minutes making no effort to aid the fallen man, but when he had
satisfied himself with the extent of the injury, and when he had
noted the froth of bloody bubbles which stained the lips of Strann,
Haw-Haw Langley turned and stalked from the room. His eyes were
points of light and his soul was crammed to repletion with
ill-tidings.</p>

<p>At the hitching rack he stepped into the saddle of a diminutive
horse, whirled it into the street with a staggering jerk of the
reins, and buried the spurs deep in the cow-pony's flanks. The poor
brute snorted and flirted its heels in the air, but Langley wrapped
his long legs around the barrel of his mount and goaded it
again.</p>

<p>His smile, which began with the crack of Barry's gun in
O'Brien's place, did not die out until he was many a mile away,
headed far up through the mountains; but as he put peak after peak
behind him and as the white light of the day diminished and puffs
of blue shadow drowned the valleys, the grin disappeared from
Haw-Haw's face. He became keenly intent on his course until, having
reached the very summit of a tall hill, he came to a halt and
peered down before him.</p>

<p>It was nearly dusk by this time and the eyes of an ordinary man
could not distinguish a tree from a rock at any great distance; but
it seemed that Haw-Haw was gifted with eyes extraordinary&mdash;the
buzzard at the top of its sky-towering circles does not see the
brown carcass far below with more certainty than Haw-Haw sensed his
direction. He waited only a few seconds before he rolled the rowel
once more along the scored flanks of his mustang and then plunged
down the slope at a reckless gallop.</p>

<p>His destination was a hut, or rather a lean-to, that pressed
against the side of the mountain, a crazy structure with a single
length of stove pipe leaning awry from the roof. And at the door of
this house Haw-Haw Langley drew rein and stepped to the ground. The
interior of the hut was dark, but Haw-Haw stole with the caution of
a wild Indian to the entrance and reconnoitered the interior,
probing every shadowy corner with his glittering eyes. For several
long moments he continued this examination, and even when he was
satisfied that there was no one in the place he did not enter, but
moved back several paces from the door and swept the sides of the
mountains with an uneasy eye. He made out, a short distance from
the door, a picketed horse which now reared up its head from the
miserable scattering of grass on which it fed and stared at the
stranger. The animal must have bulked at least twice as large as
the mount which had brought Langley to the mountain-side. And it
was muscled even out of proportion to its bulk. The head was so
tremendously broad that it gave an almost square appearance, the
neck, short and thick, the forelegs disproportionately small but
very sturdy; and the whole animal was built on a slope towards the
hind quarters which seemed to equal in massiveness all the rest of
the body. One would have said that the horse was a freak meant by
nature for the climbing of hills. And to glance at it no man could
suppose that those ponderous limbs might be moved to a gallop.
However, Haw-Haw Langley well knew the powers of the ugly beast,
and he even made a detour and walked about the horse to view it
more closely.</p>

<p>Now he again surveyed the darkening landscape and then turned
once more to the house. This time he entered with the boldness of a
possessor approaching his hearth. He lighted a match and with this
ignited a lantern hanging from the wall to the right of the door.
The furnishings of the dwelling were primitive beyond compare.
There was no sign of a chair; a huddle of blankets on the bare
boards of the floor made the bed; a saddle hung by one stirrup on
one side and on the other side leaned the skins of bob-cats, lynx,
and coyotes on their stretching and drying boards. Haw-Haw took
down the lantern and examined the pelts. The animals had been
skinned with the utmost dexterity. As far as he could see the hides
had not been marred in a single place by slips of the knife, nor
were there any blood stains to attest hurried work, or careless
shooting in the first place. The inner surfaces shone with the pure
white of old parchment But Haw-Haw gave his chief attention to the
legs and the heads of the skins, for these were the places where
carelessness or stupidity with the knife were sure to show; but the
work was perfect in every respect. Until even the critical Haw-Haw
Langley was forced to step back and shake his head in admiration.
He continued his survey of the room.</p>

<p>In one corner stood a rifle and a shot-gun; in another was a
pile of provisions&mdash;bacon, flour, salt, meal, and little else.
Spices and condiments were apparently unknown to this hermit; nor
was there even the inevitable coffee, nor any of the molasses or
other sweets which the tongue of the desert-mountainer cannot
resist. Flour, meat, and water, it seemed, made up the entire fare
of the trapper. For cookery there was an unboarded space in the
very centre of the floor with a number of rocks grouped around in
the hole and blackened with soot. The smoke must rise, therefore,
and escape through the small hole in the centre of the roof. The
length of stove-pipe which showed on the roof must have been simply
the inhabitant's idea of giving the last delicate touch of
civilisation; it was like a tassel to the cap of the Turk.</p>

<p>As Haw-Haw's observations reached this point his sharp ear
caught the faint whinny of the big horse outside. He started like
one caught in a guilty act, and sprang to the lantern. However,
with his hands upon it he thought better of it, and he placed the
light against the wall; then he turned to the entrance and looked
anxiously up the hillside.</p>

<p>What he saw was a form grotesque beyond belief. It seemed to be
some gigantic wild beast&mdash;mountain lion or great bear, though
of a size beyond credence&mdash;which slowly sprawled down the
slope walking erect upon its hind feet with its forelegs stretched
out horizontal, as if it were warning all who might behold it away.
Haw-Haw grew pale and involuntarily reached for his gun as he first
beheld this apparition, but instantly he saw the truth. It was a
man who carried a burden down the mountain-side. The burden was the
carcass of a bear; the man had drawn the forelegs over his
shoulders&mdash;his jutting elbows making what had seemed the
outstretched arms&mdash;and above the head of the burden-bearer
rose the great head of the bear. As the man came closer the
animal's head flopped to one side and a red tongue lolled from its
mouth. Haw-Haw Langley moved back step by step through the cabin
until his shoulders struck the opposite wall, and at the same time
Mac Strann entered the room. He had no ear for his visitor's hail,
but cast his burden to the floor. It dropped with a shock that
shook the house from the rattling stove-pipe to the crackling
boards. For a moment Mac Strann regarded his prey. Then he stooped
and drew open the great jaws. The mouth within was not so red as
the bloody hands of Mac Strann; and the big, white fangs, for some
reason, did not seem terrible in comparison with the hunter. Having
completed his survey he turned slowly upon Haw-Haw Langley and
lowered his eyebrows to stare.</p>

<p>So doing, the light for the first time struck full upon his
face. Haw-Haw Langley bit his thin lips and his eyes widened almost
to the normal.</p>

<p>For the ugliness of Mac Strann was that most terrible species of
ugliness&mdash;not disfigured features but a discord which pervaded
the man and came from within him&mdash;like a sound. Feature by
feature his face was not ugly. The mouth was very large, to be
sure, and the jaw too heavily square, and the nose needed somewhat
greater length and less width for real comeliness. The eyes were
truly fine, being very large and black, though when Mac Strann
lowered his bush of brows his eyes were practically reduced to
gleams of light in the consequent shadow. There was a sharp angle
in his forehead, the lines of it meeting in the centre and shelving
up and down. One felt, unpleasantly, that there were heavy muscles
overlaying that forehead. One felt that to the touch it would be a
pad of flesh, and it gave to Mac Strann, more than any other
feature, a peculiar impression of resistless physical power.</p>

<p>In the catalogue of his features, indeed, there was nothing
severely objectionable; but out of it came a feeling of <i>too much
strength</i>! A glance at his body reinsured the first thought. It
was not normal. His shirt bulged tightly at the shoulders with
muscles. He was not tall&mdash;inches shorter than his brother
Jerry, for instance&mdash;but the bulk of his body was incredible.
His torso was a veritable barrel that bulged out both in the chest
and the back. And even the tremendous thighs of Mac Strann were
perceptibly bowed out by the weight which they had to carry. And
there was about his management of his arms a peculiar awkwardness
which only the very strongest of men exhibit&mdash;as if they were
burdened by the weight of their mere dangling hands.</p>

<p>This giant, having placed his eyes in shadow, peered for a long
moment at Haw-Haw Langley, but very soon his glance began to waver.
It flashed towards the wall&mdash;it came back and rested upon
Langley again. He was like a dog, restless under a steady stare.
And as Haw-Haw Langley noted this a glitter of joy came in his
beady eyes.</p>

<p>"You're Jerry's man," said Mac Strann at length.</p>

<p>There was about his voice the same fleshy quality that was in
his face; it came literally from his stomach, and it made a
peculiar rustling sound such as comes after one has eaten sticky
sweet things. People could listen to the voice of Mac Strann and
forget that he was speaking words. The articulation ran together in
a sort of glutinous mass.</p>

<p>"I'm a friend of Jerry's," said the other. "I'm Langley."</p>

<p>The big man stretched out his hand. The hair grew black, down to
the knuckles; the blood of the bear still streaked it; it was large
enough to be an organism with independent life. But when Langley,
with some misgiving, trusted his own bony fingers within that
grasp, it was only as if something fleshy, soft, and bloodless had
closed over them. When his hand was released he rubbed it covertly
against his trowser leg&mdash;to remove dirt&mdash;restore the
circulation. He did not know why.</p>

<p>"Who's bothering Jerry?" asked Mac Strann. "And where is
he?"</p>

<p>He went to the wall without waiting for an answer and took down
the saddle. Now the cowpuncher's saddle is a heavy mass of leather
and steel, and the saddle of Mac Strann was far larger than the
ordinary. Yet he took down the saddle as one might remove a card
from a rack. Haw-Haw Langley moved towards the door, to give
himself a free space for exit.</p>

<p>"Jerry's hurt," he said, and he watched.</p>

<p>There was a ripple of pain on the face of Mac Strann.</p>

<p>"Hoss kicked him&mdash;fall on him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It weren't a hoss."</p>

<p>"Huh? A cow?"</p>

<p>"It weren't no cow. It weren't no animal."</p>

<p>Mac Strann faced full upon Langley. When he spoke it seemed as
if it were difficult for him to manage his lips. They lifted an
appreciable space before there was any sound.</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"A man."</p>

<p>Langley edged back towards the door.</p>

<p>"What with?"</p>

<p>"A gun."</p>

<p>And Langley saw the danger that was coming even before Mac
Strann moved. He gave a shrill yelp of terror and whirled and
sprang for the open. But Mac Strann sprang after him and reached.
His whole body seemed to stretch like an elastic thing, and his arm
grew longer. The hand fastened on the back of Langley, plucked him
up, and jammed him against the wall. Haw-Haw crumpled to the
floor.</p>

<p>He gasped: "It weren't me, Mac. For Gawd's sake, it weren't
me!"</p>

<p>His face was a study. There was abject terror in it, and yet
there was also a sort of grisly joy, and his eyes feasted on the
silent agony of Mac Strann.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Mac Strann.</p>

<p>"Mac," pleaded the vulture who cringed on the floor, "gimme your
word you ain't goin' to hold it agin me."</p>

<p>"Tell me," said the other, and he framed the face of the vulture
between his large hands. If he pressed the heels of those hands
together bones would snap, and Haw-Haw Langley knew it. And yet
nothing but a wild delight could have set that glitter in his
little eyes, just as nothing but a palsy of terror could have set
his limbs twitching so.</p>

<p>"Who shot him from behind?" demanded the giant.</p>

<p>"It wasn't from behind," croaked the bearer of ill-tidings. "It
was from the front."</p>

<p>"While he wasn't looking?"</p>

<p>"No. He was beat to the draw."</p>

<p>"You're <i>lyin'</i> to me," said Mac Strann slowly.</p>

<p>"So help me God!" cried Langley.</p>

<p>"Who done it?"</p>

<p>"A little feller. He ain't half as big as me. He's got a voice
like Kitty Jackson, the school-marm; and he's got eyes like a
starved pup. It was him that done it."</p>

<p>The eyes of Mac Strann grew vaguely meditative.</p>

<p>"Nope," he mused, in answer to his own thoughts, "I won't use no
rope. I'll use my hands. Where'd the bullet land?"</p>

<p>A fresh agony of trembling shook Langley, and a fresh sparkle
came in his glance.</p>

<p>"Betwixt his ribs, Mac. And right on through. And it come out
his back!"</p>

<p>But there was not an answering tremor in Mac Strann. He let his
hands fall away from the face of the vulture and he caught up the
saddle. Langley straightened himself. He peered anxiously at
Strann, as if he feared to miss something.</p>

<p>"I dunno whether he's livin' right now, or not," suggested
Haw-Haw.</p>

<p>But Mac Strann was already striding through the door.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Sweat was pouring from the lather-flecked bodies of their horses
when they drew rein, at last, at the goal of their long, fierce
ride; and Haw-Haw slunk behind the broad form of Mac Strann when
the latter strode into the hotel. Then the two started for the room
in which, they were told, lay Jerry Strann.</p>

<p>"There it is," whispered Haw-Haw, as they reached the head of
the stairs. "The door's open. If he was dead the door would be
closed, most like."</p>

<p>They stood in the hall and looked in upon a strange picture, for
flat in the bed lay Jerry Strann, his face very white and oddly
thin, and over him leaned the man who had shot him down.</p>

<p>They heard Dan Barry's soft, gentle voice query: "How you
feelin' now, partner?"</p>

<p>He leaned close beside the other, his fingers upon the wrist of
Jerry.</p>

<p>"A pile better," muttered Jerry Strann. "Seems like I got more'n
a fightin' chance to pull through now."</p>

<p>"Jest you keep lyin' here quiet," advised Dan Barry, "and don't
stir around none. Don't start no worryin'. You're goin' to live's
long as you don't lose no more blood. Keep your thoughts quiet.
They ain't no cause for you to do nothin' but jest keep your eyes
closed, and breathe, and think of yaller sunshine, and green grass
in the spring, and the wind lazyin' the clouds along across the
sky. That's all you got to think about. Jest keep quiet,
partner."</p>

<p>"It's easy to do it now you're with me. Seems like they's a pile
of strength runnin' into me from the tips of your fingers, my
frien'. And&mdash;I was <i>some</i> fool to start that fight with
you, Barry."</p>

<p>"Jest forget all that," murmured the other. "And keep your voice
down. I've forgot it; you forget it. It ain't never happened."</p>

<p>"What's it mean?" frowned Mac Strann, whispering to Haw-Haw.</p>

<p>The eyes of the latter glittered like beads.</p>

<p>"That's him that shot Jerry," said Haw-Haw. "Him!"</p>

<p>"Hell!" snarled Mac Strann, and went through the door.</p>

<p>At the first sound of his heavy footfall, the head of Barry
raised and turned in a light, swift movement. The next instant he
was on his feet. A moment before his face had been as gentle as
that of a mother leaning over a sick child; but one glimpse of the
threat in the contorted brows of Mac Strann set a gleam in his own
eyes, an answer as distinct as the click of metal against metal.
Not a word had been said, but Jerry, who had lain with his eyes
closed, seemed to sense a change in the atmosphere of peace which
had enwrapped him the moment before. His eyes flashed open; and he
saw his burly brother.</p>

<p>But Mac Strann had no eye for any saving Dan Barry.</p>

<p>"Are you the creepin', sneakin' snake that done&mdash;this?"</p>

<p>"You got me figured right," answered Dan coldly.</p>

<p>"Then, by God&mdash;&mdash;" began the roaring voice of Mac, but
Jerry Strann stirred wildly on the bed.</p>

<p>"Mac!" he called, "Mac!" His voice went suddenly horribly thick,
a bubbling, liquid sound. "For God's sake, Mac!"</p>

<p>He had reared himself up on one elbow, his arm stretched out to
his brother. And a foam of crimson stood on his lips.</p>

<p>"Mac, don't pull no gun! It was me that was in wrong!"</p>

<p>And then he fell back in the bed, and into the arms of Mac, who
was beside him, moaning: "Buck up, Jerry. Talk to me, boy!"</p>

<p>"Mac, you've finished the job," came the husky whisper.</p>

<p>Mac Strann raised his head, and his terrible eyes fixed upon Dan
Barry. And there was no pity in the face of the other. The first
threat had wiped every vestige of human tenderness out of his eyes,
and now, with something like a sneer on his lips, and with a
glimmer of yellow light in his eyes, he was backing towards the
door, and noiselessly as a shadow he slipped out and was gone.</p>

<h2><a id="chap12" name="chap12">12. FINESSE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"A man talks because he's drunk or lonesome; a
girl talks because that's her way of takin' exercise."</p>

<p>This was a maxim of Buck Daniels, and Buck Daniels knew a great
deal about women, as many a school marm and many a rancher's
daughter of the mountain-desert could testify.</p>

<p>Also Buck Daniels said of women: "It ain't what you say to 'em
so much as the tune you put it to."</p>

<p>Now he sat this day in O'Brien's hotel dining-room. It was the
lazy and idle hour between three and four in the afternoon, and
since the men of the mountain-desert eat promptly at six, twelve,
and six, there was not a soul in the room when he entered. Nor was
there a hint of eating utensils on the tables. Nevertheless Buck
Daniels was not dismayed. He selected a corner-table by instinct
and smote upon the surface with the flat of his hand. It made a
report like the spat of a forty-five; heavy footsteps approached, a
door flung open, and a cross-eyed slattern stood in the opening. At
the sight of Buck Daniels sitting with his hands on his hips and
his sombrero pushed back to a good-natured distance on his head the
lady puffed with rage.</p>

<p>"What in hell d'you think this is?" bellowed this gentle
creature, and the tone echoed heavily back from all four walls.
"You're three hours late and you get no chuck here. On your way,
stranger!"</p>

<p>Buck Daniels elevated himself slowly from the chair and stood at
his full height. With a motion fully as deliberate he removed his
sombrero and bowed to such a depth that the brim of the hat brushed
the floor.</p>

<p>"Lady," he said humbly, "I was thinkin' that some gent run this
here eatin' place. Which if you'll excuse me half a minute I'll
ramble outside and sluice off some of the dust. If I'd known you
was here I wouldn't of thought of comin' in here like this."</p>

<p>The lady with the defective eyes glared fiercely at him. Her
judgment wavered two ways. Her first inclination was to hold that
the fellow was jibing at her covertly, and she followed her
original impulse far enough to clasp a neighboring sugar-bowl in a
large, capable hand. A second and more merciful thought entered her
brain and stole slowly through it, like a faint echo in a great
cave.</p>

<p>"You don't have to make yourself pretty to talk to me," she said
thoughtfully. "But if you're here for chow you're too late."</p>

<p>"Ma'am," said Buck Daniels instantly, "when I come in here I was
hungry enough to eat nails; but I'll forget about chuck if you'll
sit down an' chin with me a while."</p>

<p>The large hand of the cross-eyed lady stole out once more and
rested upon the sugar-bowl.</p>

<p>"D'you mind sayin' that over agin?" she queried.</p>

<p>"Lonesomeness is worse'n hunger," said Buck Daniels, and he met
her gaze steadily with his black eyes.</p>

<p>The hand released the sugar-bowl once more; something resembling
colour stole into the brown cheeks of the maiden.</p>

<p>She said, relentingly: "Maybe you been off by yourse'f mining,
stranger?"</p>

<p>Buck Daniels drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"Mines?" he said, and then laughed bitterly. "If that was all I
been doin'&mdash;" he began darkly&mdash;and then stopped.</p>

<p>The waitress started.</p>

<p>"Maybe this here is my last chance to get chuck for days an'
days. Well, let it go. If I stayed here with you I'd be talkin' too
much!"</p>

<p>He turned slowly towards the door. His step was very slow
indeed.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," called the maiden. "There ain't any call for
that play. If you're in wrong somewhere&mdash;well, stranger, just
take that chair and I'll have some ham-and in front of you inside
of a minute."</p>

<p>She had slammed through the door before Buck turned, and he sat
down, smiling pleasantly to himself. Half of a mirror decorated the
wall beside his table, and into this Buck peered. His black locks
were sadly disarrayed, and he combed them into some semblance of
order with his fingers. He had hardly finished this task when the
door was kicked open with such force that it whacked against the
wall, and the waitress appeared with an armful of steaming food.
Before Buck's widening eyes she swiftly set forth an array of
bread, butter in chunks, crisp French-fried potatoes, a large slab
of ham on one plate and several fried eggs on another, and above
all there was a mighty pewter cup of coffee blacker than the heart
of night. Yearning seized upon Buck Daniels, but policy was
stronger than hunger in his subtle mind. He rose again; he drew
forth the chair opposite his own.</p>

<p>"Ma'am," said Buck Daniels, "ain't you going to favor me by
sittin' down?"</p>

<p>The lady blinked her unfocused eyes.</p>

<p>"Ain't I what?" she was finally able to ask.</p>

<p>"I know," said Buck Daniels swiftly, "that you're terrible busy;
which you ain't got time to waste on a stranger like me."</p>

<p>She turned upon Buck those uncertain and wistful eyes. It was a
generous face. Mouth, cheekbones, and jaw were of vast proportions,
while the forehead, eyes, and nose were as remarkably diminutive.
Her glance lowered to the floor; she shrugged her wide shoulders
and began to wipe the vestiges of dishwater from her freckled
hands.</p>

<p>"You men are terrible foolish," she said. "There ain't no
tellin' what you mean by what you say."</p>

<p>And she sank slowly into the chair. It gave voice in sharp
protest at her weight. Buck Daniels retreated to the opposite side
of the table and took his place.</p>

<p>"Ma'am," he began, "don't I look honest?" So saying, he slid
half a dozen eggs and a section of bacon from the platter to his
plate.</p>

<p>"I dunno," said the maiden, with one eye upon him and the other
plunging into the future. "There ain't no trusting men. Take 'em by
the lot and they're awful forgetful."</p>

<p>"If you knowed me better," said Buck sadly, disposing of a slab
of bread spread thick with the pale butter and following this with
a pile of fried potatoes astutely balanced on his knife. "If you
knowed me better, ma'am, you wouldn't have no suspicions."</p>

<p>"What might it be that you been doin'?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>Buck Daniels paused in his attack on the food and stared at
her.</p>

<p>He quoted deftly from a magazine which had once fallen in his
way: "Some day maybe I can tell you. There's something about your
eyes that tells me you'd understand."</p>

<p>At the mention of her eyes the waitress blinked and stiffened in
her chair, while a huge, red fist balled itself in readiness for
action. But the expression of Buck Daniels was as blandly open as
the smile of infancy. The lady relaxed and an unmistakable blush
tinged even her nose with colour.</p>

<p>"It ain't after my nature to be askin' questions," she
announced. "You don't have to tell me no more'n you want to."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Buck instantly. "I knew you was that kind. It
ain't hard," he went on smoothly, "to tell a lady when you see one.
I can tell you this much to start with. I'm lookin' for a quiet
town where I can settle down permanent. And as far as I can see,
Brownsville looks sort of quiet to me."</p>

<p>So saying, he disposed of the rest of his food by an act akin to
legerdemain, and then fastened a keen eye upon the lady. She was in
the midst of a struggle of some sort. But she could not keep the
truth from her tongue.</p>

<p>"Take it by and large," she said at length, "Brownsville is as
peaceable as most; but just now, stranger, it's all set for a big
bust." She turned heavily in her chair and glanced about the room.
Then she faced Daniels once more and cupped her hands about her
mouth. "Stranger," she said in a stage whisper, "Mac Strann is in
town!"</p>

<p>The eyes of Buck Daniels wandered.</p>

<p>"Don't you know him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nope."</p>

<p>"Never heard of him?"</p>

<p>"Nope."</p>

<p>"Well," sighed the waitress, "you've had some luck in your life.
Take a cross between a bulldog and a mustang and a
mountain-lion&mdash;that's Mac Strann. He's in town, and he's here
for killin'."</p>

<p>"You don't say, ma'am. And why don't they lock him up?"</p>

<p>"Because he ain't done nothin' yet to be locked up about. That's
the way with him. And when he does a thing he always makes the man
he's after pull his gun first. Smart? I'll say he's just like an
Indian, that Mac Strann!"</p>

<p>"But who's he after?"</p>

<p>"The feller that plugged his brother, Jerry."</p>

<p>"Kind of looks like he had reason for a killing, then."</p>

<p>"Nope. Jerry had it comin' to him. He was always raising
trouble, Jerry was. And this time, he pulled his gun first.
Everybody seen him."</p>

<p>"He run into a gunman?"</p>

<p>"Gunman?" she laughed heartily. "Partner, if it wasn't for
something funny about his eyes, I wouldn't be no more afraid of
that gunman than I am of a tabby-cat. And me a weak woman. The
quietest lookin' sort that ever come to Brownsville. But there's
something queer about him. He knows that Mac Strann is here in
town. He knows that Mac Strann is waiting for Jerry to die. He
knows that when Jerry dies Mac will be out for a killin'. And this
here stranger is just sittin' around and waitin' to be killed! Can
you beat that?"</p>

<p>But Buck Daniels had grown strangely excited.</p>

<p>"What did you say there was about his eyes?" he asked
sharply.</p>

<p>She grew suddenly suspicious.</p>

<p>"D' you know him?"</p>

<p>"No. But you was talkin' about his eyes?"</p>

<p>"I dunno what it is. I ain't the only one that's seen it. There
ain't no word you can put to it. It's just there. That's all."</p>

<p>The voice of Buck Daniels fell to a whisper.</p>

<p>"It's sort of fire," he suggested. "Ain't it a kind of light
<i>behind</i> his eyes?"</p>

<p>But the waitress stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"Fire?" she gasped. "A light <i>behind</i> his eyes? M'frien',
are you tryin' to string me?"</p>

<p>"What's his name?"</p>

<p>"I dunno."</p>

<p>"Ma'am," said Daniels, rising hastily. "Here's a dollar if
you'll take me to him."</p>

<p>"You don't need no guide," she replied. "Listen to that, will
you?"</p>

<p>And as he hearkened obediently Buck Daniels heard a strain of
whistling, needle-sharp with distance.</p>

<p>"That's him," nodded the woman. "He's always goin' about
whistling to himself. Kind of a nut, he is."</p>

<p>"It's him!" cried Buck Daniels. "It's him!"</p>

<p>And with this ungrammatical burst of joy he bolted from the
room.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap13" name="chap13">13. THE THREE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The whistling came from behind the hotel, and
although it ended as soon as he reached the veranda of the
building, Buck Daniels hurried to the rear of the place. There were
the long, low sheds of the barn, and behind these, he knew, must be
the corrals. He raced around the corner of the shed and there came
to a halt, for he saw a thing that turned his blood to ice.</p>

<p>One of those rare rains of the mountain-desert had recently
fallen and the corrals behind the barn were carpeted with a short,
thick grass. In the small corral nearest him he beheld, rolling on
that carpet of grass, a great wolf&mdash;or a dog as large and as
rough-coated as a wolf, and a man; and they were engaged in a
desperate and silent struggle for mastery. Their movements were so
lightning fast that Buck Daniels could not make out distinct forms
from the tangle. But he saw the great white teeth of the wolf flash
in the sun one instant, and the next the man had whirled on top. It
was Dan and Bart at play.</p>

<p>No outcry from Dan; no growl from the wolf. Buck felt the old
chill which never left him when he saw the fierce game of the wolf
and the wolf-man. All this passed in the twinkling of an eye, and
then Dan, by a prodigious effort, had thrown the great beast away
from him, so that Bart fell upon its back. Dan leaped with
outstretched arms upon the fallen animal, and buried his clutching
hands in the throat of the beast.</p>

<p>Yet still there was a thrill to add to these, for now a black
horse appeared in the picture, a miracle of slender, shimmering
grace&mdash;and he rushed with flattened ears upon the two
twisting, writhing, prostrate figures. His teeth were
bared&mdash;he was more like a prodigious dog than a horse. And
those teeth closed on the back of the man's neck&mdash;or did they
merely pinch his shirt?&mdash;and then Dan was dragged bodily away
from the wolf and thrown through the air by a flirt of the
stallion's head.</p>

<p>Horrible! Buck Daniels shuddered and then he grinned
shamefacedly in apology to himself.</p>

<p>"The three of 'em!" he grunted, and stepped closer to the fence
to watch.</p>

<p>The instant the man was torn away by the intercession of the
horse, the wolf regained its feet and rushed upon him; but Dan had
landed from his fall upon his feet, with catlike agility, and now
he dodged the rush of the wolf and the arrowy spring of the
creature, and sprang in his turn towards the stallion.</p>

<p>The black met this attack by rearing, his ears flattened, his
teeth bared, his eyes terrible to behold. As the man raced close
the stallion struck with lightning hoofs, but the blow failed of
its mark&mdash;by the breadth of a hair. And the assailant,
swerving like a will-o'-the-wisp, darted to the side of the animal
and leaped upon its back. At the same instant the wolf left the
ground with terribly gaping mouth in a spring for the rider; but
Dan flattened himself along the shining back of his mount and the
wolf catapulted harmlessly past.</p>

<p>After this failure the wolf-dog seemed to desire no further
active part in the struggle, but took up a position to one side,
and there, with lolling tongue and red-stained eyes, watched the
battle continue. The stallion, to be sure, kept up the conflict
with a whole-hearted energy. Never had Buck Daniels in a long and
varied career seen such wild pitching. The black leaped here and
there, doubling about with the sinuous speed of a snake, springing
high in the air one instant, and landing the next on stiff legs;
dropping to the ground the next second, and rolling to crush the
rider; up again like a leaf jerked up by a gale of wind, and so the
fierce struggle continued, with the wild rider slapping the neck of
the horse as if he would encourage it to more terrible efforts, and
drumming its round barrel with vindictive heels. His hair blew
black; his face flushed; and in his eyes there was the joy of the
sailor, long land-bound, who climbs at last the tallest mast and
feels it pitch beneath him and catches the sharp tang of the
travelled wind.</p>

<p>The struggle ceased as if in obedience to an inaudible command.
From the full frenzy of motion horse and man were suddenly
moveless. Then Dan slipped from his seat and stood before his
mount. At once the ears of the stallion, which had been flat back,
pricked sharply forward; the eyes of the animal grew luminous and
soft as the eyes of a woman, and he dropped the black velvet of his
muzzle beneath the master's chin. As for Dan Barry, he rewarded
this outburst of affection with no touch of his hand; but his lips
moved, and he seemed to be whispering a secret to his horse. The
wolf in the meantime had viewed this scene with growing unrest, and
now it trotted up and placed itself at the side of the man.
Receiving no attention in this position, it caught the arm of the
man between its great fangs and drew his hands down. The stallion,
angered by this interruption, raised a delicate forefoot to strike,
and was received with a terrific snarl&mdash;the first sound of the
entire scene.</p>

<p>"Bart," said the man, and his voice was not raised or harsh, but
came as softly as running water, "if you ain't going to be a
gentleman, I got to teach you manners. Get up on Satan's back and
lie down till I tell you to get off."</p>

<p>The wolf received this command with a snarl even more
blood-curdling than before, but he obeyed, slinking sidewise a
reluctant pace or two, and then springing to the back of the
stallion with a single bound. There he crouched, still snarling
softly until his master raised a significant forefinger. At that he
lowered his head and maintained a fiercely observant silence.</p>

<p>"Dan!" called Buck Daniels.</p>

<p>The other whirled.</p>

<p>"Speakin' of pets," observed Buck Daniels, "I heard tell once
about a gent that had a tame lion. Which you got the outbeatingest
pair I ever see, Dan. Gentle, ain't they, like a stampede of
cows!"</p>

<p>But Barry left this remark unanswered. He ran to the tall fence,
placed his hand on the top rail, and vaulted lightly over it. Then
he clasped the hand of the larger man, and his face lighted.</p>

<p>"Buck," he said, "I been sort of lonesome. It feels pretty good
to see you agin."</p>

<p>"Oh man," answered Buck Daniels, "speakin' of bein'
lonesome&mdash;" He checked himself. "How about steppin' inside and
havin' a talk?"</p>

<p>The other started forward agreeably, but stopped almost at
once.</p>

<p>"Heel!" he called, without turning his head.</p>

<p>Black Bart left the back of the stallion in a long bound that
carried him half way to the fence. His next leap brought him over
the rail and beside his master. Buck Daniels moved back a step
involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Bart," he said, "d'you know me?"</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand; and was received with a sudden baring
of the fangs.</p>

<p>"Nice dog!" said Buck sarcastically. "Regular house-pet, ain't
he?"</p>

<p>The other apparently missed the entire point of this remark. He
said in his gentle, serious way: "He used to be real wild, Buck.
But now he don't mind people. He let the cook feed him a chunk o'
meat the other day; and you remember he don't usually touch stuff
that other men have handled."</p>

<p>"Yep," grunted Buck, "it's sure disgustin' to have a dog as tame
as that. I'd bet he ain't killed another dog for a whole day,
maybe!"</p>

<p>And still Barry saw no irony in this.</p>

<p>He answered, as gravely as before: "No, it was the day before
yesterday. Somebody come to town and got drunk. He had two dogs,
and sicked 'em on Bart."</p>

<p>Buck Daniels controlled an incipient shudder.</p>

<p>"Both dead?"</p>

<p>"I was inside the house," said Dan sadly, "and it took me a
couple of seconds to get outside. Of course by that time Bart had
cut their throats."</p>

<p>"Of course. Didn't the drunk guy try to pot Bart?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he got out his gun; but, Mr. O'Brien, the bartender,
persuaded him out of it. I was glad there wasn't no trouble."</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed Buck Daniels. And then: "Well, let's go
inside. We'll take your man-eater along, if you want to."</p>

<p>A shadow came in the eyes of Barry.</p>

<p>"Can't we talk jest as well out here?"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with findin' some chairs?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't like to get inside walls. You know how four
walls seem like so many pairs of eyes standin' around you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Buck bluntly, "I don't know nothin' of the kind. What
d'you mean?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," answered Barry, depressed. "It jest seems that way.
Ain't you noticed how sort of close it is in a house? Hard to
breathe? Like you had on a shirt too small for you."</p>

<p>"We'll stay out here, then."</p>

<p>The other nodded, smiled, and made a gesture to the dog behind
him. Black Bart crouched on the ground, and Dan Barry sat down
cross-legged, his shoulders leaning against the shaggy pelt of
Bart. Daniels followed the example with less grace. He was thinking
very hard and fast, and he rolled a Durham cigarette to fill the
interlude.</p>

<p>"I s'pose you're bustin' to find out the news about the folks,"
he said dryly, at last.</p>

<p>The other sat with his hands loosely clasped in his lap. His
wide eyes looked far away, and there was about his lips that
looseness, that lack of compression, which one sees so often in
children. He might have sat, in that posture, for the statue of
thoughtlessness.</p>

<p>"What folks?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>Buck Daniels had lighted a match, but now he sat staring blank
until the match burned down to his fingers. With an oath he tossed
the remnant away and lighted another. He had drawn down several
long breaths of smoke to the bottom of his lungs before he could
speak again.</p>

<p>"Some people you used to know; I suppose you've forgotten all
about 'em, eh?" His eyes narrowed; there was a spark of something
akin to dread in them. "Kate Cumberland?" he queried.</p>

<p>A light came in the face of Dan Barry.</p>

<p>"Kate Cumberland?" he repeated. "How is she, Buck? Lately, I
been thinkin' about her every day."</p>

<p>A trembling took the body and the voice of Daniels; his errand,
after all, might meet some success.</p>

<p>"Kate?" he repeated. "Oh, ay, she's well enough. But Joe
Cumberland ain't."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"He's dyin', Dan."</p>

<p>And Dan replied calmly. "He's kind of old, I s'pose."</p>

<p>"Old?" said Buck, with a sort of horror. "Yes, he's old, right
enough. D'you know why he's dying? It's because you went away the
way you done, Dan. That's what's killin' him."</p>

<p>Something of thought came in the face of Barry.</p>

<p>"Maybe I understand," he said slowly. "If I was to lose Satan,
or Bart&mdash;" here the great dog whined at the mention of his
name, and Barry dropped a slender hand across the scarred forehead
of his servant. "If I was to lose 'em, I'd sort of mourn for 'em,
maybe."</p>

<p>Buck Daniels set his teeth.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it seems possible," he said, "that a man could
miss another man the way you could miss your&mdash;dog, eh? But it
is! Joe Cumberland is dying for you, Dan, as sure as if you'd put a
bullet in his bowels."</p>

<p>The other hesitated and then frowned and made a gesture of vague
dismissal.</p>

<p>"Don't you figure on doin' nothing about it?" asked Buck
softly.</p>

<p>"What could I do?"</p>

<p>"My God A'mighty, ain't you got no human feelin's?"</p>

<p>"I dunno what you mean," said the soft voice.</p>

<p>"This! Can't you git on your hoss and ride back with me to
Cumberland Ranch? Stay with the old man till he gets back on his
feet. Ain't that easy to do? Is your time so damned valuable you
can't spare a few days for that?"</p>

<p>"But I am goin' back," answered Dan, in a rather hurt voice.
"They ain't no need for cussin' me, Buck. I been thinkin' of Kate,
every day, almost."</p>

<p>"Since when?"</p>

<p>"I dunno." Dan stirred uneasily. He looked up, and far above
Buck, following the direction of Dan's eyes, saw a pattern of wild
geese. "I been sort of driftin' North towards the Cumberland Ranch
and Kate," went on Dan. He sighed: "I been thinkin' of her eyes,
which is blue, Buck, and her hair, and the soft sound of her voice.
They been hangin' in my ears, stayin' behind my eyes, lately, and I
been driftin' up that way steady."</p>

<p>"Why, man," cried Buck, "then what's there to keep you here?
Jump on your hoss, and we'll head North in ten minutes."</p>

<p>"I will!" said Dan, full as eagerly. "We'll start full
speed."</p>

<p>"Come on, then."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" said Dan, his voice growing suddenly cold. "I
been forgettin' something."</p>

<p>Buck Daniels turned and found his companion strangely changed.
There was a set expression of coldness about his face, and a chill
glitter in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I got to wait here for something."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"They's a man in town that may want to see me."</p>

<p>"Mac Strann! I've heard about him. Dan, are you goin' to let Joe
Cumberland die because you want to stay here and fight it out with
a dirty cutthroat?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to fight," protested Barry. "No, there ain't
nothin' I like less than fightin'!"</p>

<p>Buck Daniels cursed softly and continuously to himself.</p>

<p>"Dan," he said, "can you sit there and lie like that to me?
Ain't I seen you in action? Don't I remember the way you trailed
Jim Silent? Don't I remember how we all got down and prayed you to
keep away from Jim? Don't I remember how you threw everything to
hell so's you could get your hands on Jim? My God A'mighty, man,
didn't I see your face when you had your fingers in Silent's
throat?"</p>

<p>An expression of unutterable revulsion rippled over the face of
Dan Barry.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he commanded softly, and raised his slender hand. "Don't
keep on talkin' about it. It makes me sick&mdash;all through. Oh,
Buck, they's a tingle in the tips of my fingers still from the time
I had 'em in his throat. And it makes me feel unclean&mdash;the
sort of uncleanness that won't wash out with no kind of soap and
water. Buck, I'd most rather die myself than fight a man!"</p>

<p>A vast amazement overspread the countenance of Buck Daniels as
he listened to this outburst; it was as if he had heard a healthy
man proclaim that he had no desire for bread and meat. Something
rose to his lips, but he swallowed it.</p>

<p>"Then it looks kind of simple to me," he said. "You hate
fightin'. This gent Mac Strann likes it; he lives on it; he don't
do nothing but wait from day to day hungerin' for a scrap. What's
the out? Jest this! You hop on your hoss and ride out with me.
Young Jerry Strann kicks out&mdash;Mac Strann starts lookin' for
you&mdash;he hears that you've beat it&mdash;he goes off and
forgets about you. Ain't that simple?"</p>

<p>The old uneasiness returned to the far-seeing eyes of Dan
Barry.</p>

<p>"I dunno," he said, "maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he paused again.</p>

<p>"Have you got anything to say agin it?" urged Buck, arguing
desperately.</p>

<p>"I dunno," repeated Barry, confused, "except that I keep
thinking what a terrible disappointment it'll be to this Mac Strann
when his brother dies and I ain't around."</p>

<p>Buck Daniels stared, blinked, and then burst into unmelodious
laughter. Satan trotted across the corral and raised his head above
the fence, whinnying softly. Barry turned his head and smiled up to
the horse.</p>

<p>Then he said: "Seems like if Jerry Strann dies I owe somebody
something. Who? Mac Strann, I reckon. I sort of got to stay and
give him his chance."</p>

<p>"I hope to God," burst out Daniels, smashing his hands together,
"that Mac Strann beats you to a pulp! That's what I hope!"</p>

<p>The eyes of Dan Barry widened.</p>

<p>"Why d'you hope that?" he asked gently.</p>

<p>It brought Daniels again to speechlessness.</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" he growled to himself. "Are you a human bein'
and yet you think more of your hoss and your damned wolf-dog than
you do of the life of a man? Dan, I'm askin' you straight, is that
a square thing to do?"</p>

<p>The fragile hands went out to him, palm up.</p>

<p>"Don't you see, Buck? I don't want to be this way. I jest can't
help it!"</p>

<p>"Then the Lord help poor old Joe Cumberland&mdash;him that took
you in out of the desert&mdash;him that raised you from the time
you was a kid&mdash;him that nursed you like you was his own
baby&mdash;him that loved you more'n he loved Kate&mdash;him that's
lyin' back there now with fire in his eyes, waitin', waitin',
waitin', for you to come back. Dan, if you was to see him you'd go
down on your knees and ask him to forgive you!"</p>

<p>"I s'pose I would," murmured Barry thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Dan, you're goin' to go with me!"</p>

<p>"I don't somehow think it's my time for movin', Buck."</p>

<p>"Is that all you got to say to me?"</p>

<p>"I guess maybe it is, Buck."</p>

<p>"If I was to beg you to come for old-time's sake, and all we
been through together, you and me, wouldn't it make no difference
to you?"</p>

<p>The large, gentle eyes focused far beyond Buck Daniels,
somewhere on a point in the pale, hazy blue of the spring sky.</p>

<p>"I'm kind of tired of talkin', Buck," he said at length.</p>

<p>And Buck Daniels rose and walked slowly away, with his head
fallen. Behind him the stallion neighed suddenly and loud, and it
was so much like a blast of defiant triumph that Buck whirled and
shook his clenched fist at Satan.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap14" name="chap14">14. MUSIC FOR OLD NICK</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A thought is like a spur. It lifts the head of a
man as the spur makes the horse toss his; and it quickens the pace
with a subtle addition of strength. Such a thought came to Buck
Daniels as he stepped again on the veranda of the hotel. It could
not have been an altogether pleasant inspiration, for it drained
the colour from his face and made him clench his broad hands; and
next he loosened his revolver in its holster. A thought of
fighting&mdash;of some desperate chance he had once taken,
perhaps.</p>

<p>But also it was a thought which needed considerable thought. He
slumped into a wicker chair at one end of the porch and sat with
his chin resting on his chest while he smoked cigarette after
cigarette and tossed the butts idly over the rail. More than once
he pressed his hand against his lips as though there were sudden
pains there. The colour did not come back to his face; it continued
as bloodless as ever, but there was a ponderable light in his eyes,
and his jaws became more and more firmly set. It was not a pleasant
face to watch at that moment, for he seemed to sit with a growing
resolve.</p>

<p>Long moments passed before he moved a muscle, but then he heard,
far away, thin, and clear, whistling from behind the hotel. It was
no recognisable tune. It was rather a strange improvisation, with
singable fragments here and there, and then wild, free runs and
trills. It was as if some bird of exquisite singing powers should
be taken in a rapture of song, so that it whistled snatches here
and there of its usual melody, but all between were great,
whole-throated rhapsodies. As the sound of this whistling came to
him, Buck raised his head suddenly. And finally, still listening,
he rose to his feet and turned into the dining-room.</p>

<p>There he found the waitress he had met before, and he asked her
for the name of the doctor who took care of the wounded Jerry
Strann.</p>

<p>"There ain't no doc," said the waitress. "It's Fatty Matthews,
the deputy marshal, who takes care of that Strann&mdash;bad luck to
him! Fatty's in the barroom now. But what's the matter? You seem
like you was hearin' something?"</p>

<p>"I am," replied Daniels enigmatically. "I'm hearin' something
that would be music for the ears of Old Nick."</p>

<p>And he turned on his heel and strode for the barroom. There he
found Fatty in the very act of disposing of a stiff three-fingers
of red-eye. Daniels stepped to the bar, poured his own drink, and
then stood toying with the glass. For though the effect of red-eye
may be pleasant enough, it has an essence which appalls the
stoutest heart and singes the most leathery throat; it is to
full-grown men what castor oil is to a child. Why men drink it is a
mystery whose secret is known only to the profound soul of the
mountain-desert. But while Daniels fingered his glass he kept an
eye upon the other man at the bar.</p>

<p>It was unquestionably the one he sought. The excess flesh of the
deputy marshal would have brought his nickname to the mind of an
imbecile. However, Fatty was humming softly to himself, and it is
not the habit of men who treat very sick patients to sing.</p>

<p>"I'll hit it agin," said Fatty. "I need it."</p>

<p>"Have a bad time of it to-day?" asked O'Brien
sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Bad time to-day? Yep, an' every day is the same. I tell you,
O'Brien, it takes a pile of nerve to stand around that room
expectin' Jerry to pass out any minute, and the eyes of that devil
Mac Strann followin' you every step you make. D'you know, if Jerry
dies I figure Mac to go at my throat like a bulldog."</p>

<p>"You're wrong, Fatty," replied O'Brien. "That ain't his way
about it. He takes his time killin' a man. Waits till he can get
him in a public place and make him start the picture. That's Mac
Strann! Remember Fitzpatrick? Mac Strann followed Fitz nigh onto
two months, but Fitz knew what was up and he never would make a
move. He knowed that if he made a wrong pass it would be his last.
So he took everything and let it pass by. But finally it got on his
nerves. One time&mdash;it was right here in my barroom,
Fatty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The hell you say!"</p>

<p>"Yep, that was before your time around these parts. But Fitz had
a couple of jolts of red-eye under his vest and felt pretty strong.
Mac Strann happened in and first thing you know they was at it.
Well, Fitz was a big man. I ain't small, but I had to look up when
I talked to Fitz. Scotch-Irish, and they got fightin' bred into
their bone. Mac Strann passed him a look and Fitz come back with a
word. Soon as he got started he couldn't stop. Wasn't a pretty
thing to watch, either. You could see in Fitz's face that he knew
he was done for before he started, but he wouldn't let up. The
booze had him going and he was too proud to back down. Pretty soon
he started cussing Mac Strann.</p>

<p>"Well, by that time everybody had cleared out of the saloon,
because they knowed that them sort of words meant bullets comin'.
But Mac Strann jest stood there watchin', and grinnin' in his ugly
way&mdash;damn his soul black!&mdash;and never sayin' a word back.
By God, Fatty, he looked sort of hungry. When he grinned, his upper
lip went up kind of slow and you could see his big teeth. I
expected to see him make a move to sink 'em in the throat of Fitz.
But he didn't. Nope, he didn't make a move, and all the time Fitz
ravin' and gettin' worse and worse. Finally Fitz made the move.
Yep, he pulled his gun and had it damned near clean on Mac Strann
before that devil would stir. But when he <i>did</i>, it was jest a
flash of light. Both them guns went off, but Mac's bullet hit
Fitz's hand and knocked the gun out of it&mdash;so of course his
shot went wild. But Fitz could see his own blood, and you know what
that does to the Scotch-Irish? Makes <i>some</i> people quit cold
to see their own blood. I remember a kid at school that was a whale
at fightin' till his nose got to bleedin', or something, and then
he'd quit cold. But you take a Scotch-Irishman and it works just
the other way. Show him his own colour and he goes plumb crazy.</p>

<p>"That's what happened to Fitz. When he saw the blood on his hand
he made a dive at Mac Strann. After that it wasn't the sort of
thing that makes a good story. Mac Strann got him around the ribs
and I heard the bones crack. God! And him still squeezin', and Fitz
beatin' away at Mac's face with his bleedin' hand.</p>

<p>"Will you b'lieve that I stood here and was sort of froze? Yes,
Fatty, I couldn't make a move. And I was sort of sick and hollow
inside the same way I went one time when I was a kid and seen a big
bull horn a yearlin'.</p>

<p>"Then I heard the breath of Fitz comin' hoarse, with a rattle in
it&mdash;and I heard Mac Strann whining like a dog that's tasted
blood and is starvin' for more. A thing to make your hair go up on
end, like they say in the story-books.</p>

<p>"Then Fitz&mdash;he was plumb mad&mdash;tried to bite Mac
Strann. And then Mac let go of him and set his hands on the throat
of Fitz. It happened like a flash&mdash;I'm here to swear that I
could hear the bones crunch. And then Fitz's mouth sagged open and
his eyes rolled up to the ceiling, and Mac Strann threw him down on
the floor. Just like that! Damn him! And then he stood over poor
dead Fitz and kicked him in those busted ribs and turned over to
the bar and says to me: 'Gimme!'</p>

<p>"Like a damned beast! He wanted to drink right there with his
dead man beside him. And what was worse, I had to give him the
bottle. There was a sort of haze in front of my eyes. I wanted to
pump that devil full of lead, but I knowed it was plain suicide to
try it.</p>

<p>"So there he stood and ups with a glass that was brimmin' full,
and downs it at a swallow&mdash;gurglin'&mdash;like a hog! Fatty,
how long will it be before there's an end to Mac Strann?"</p>

<p>But Fatty Matthews shrugged his thick shoulders and poured
himself another drink.</p>

<p>"There ain't a hope for Jerry Strann?" cut in Buck Daniels.</p>

<p>"Not one in a million," coughed Fatty, disposing of another
formidable potion.</p>

<p>"And when Jerry dies, Mac starts for this Barry?"</p>

<p>"Who's been tellin' you?" queried O'Brien dryly. "Maybe you been
readin' minds, stranger?"</p>

<p>Buck Daniels regarded the bartender with a mild and steadfast
interest. He was smiling with the utmost good-humour, but there was
that about him which made big O'Brien flush and look down to his
array of glasses behind the bar.</p>

<p>"I been wondering," went on Daniels, "if Mac Strann mightn't
come out with Barry about the way Jerry did. Ain't it
possible?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Fatty Matthews with calm decision. "It ain't
possible. Well, I'm due back in my bear cage. Y'ought to look in on
me, O'Brien, and see the mountain-lion dyin' and the grizzly
lookin' on."</p>

<p>"Will it last long?" queried O'Brien.</p>

<p>"Somewhere's about this evening."</p>

<p>Here Daniels started violently and closed his hand hard around
his whiskey glass which he had not yet raised towards his lips.</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that, marshal?" he asked. "If Jerry's held on
this long ain't there a chance that he'll hold on longer? Can you
date him up for to-night as sure as that?"</p>

<p>"I can," said the deputy marshal. "It ain't hard when you seen
as many go west as I've seen. It ain't harder than it is to tell
when the sand will be out of an hour glass. When they begin going
down the last hill it ain't hard to tell when they'll reach the
bottom."</p>

<p>"Ain't you had anybody to spell you, Fatty?" broke in
O'Brien.</p>

<p>"Yep. I got Haw-Haw Langley up there. But he ain't much help.
Just sits around with his hands folded. Kind of looks like Haw-Haw
<i>wanted</i> Jerry to pass out."</p>

<p>And Matthews went humming through the swinging door.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="chap15" name="chap15">15. OLD GARY PETERS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">For some moments after this Buck Daniels remained
at the bar with his hand clenched around his glass and his eyes
fixed before him in the peculiar second-sighted manner which had
marked him when he sat so long on the veranda.</p>

<p>"Funny thing," began O'Brien, to make conversation, "how many
fellers go west at sunset. Seems like they let go all holts as soon
as the dark comes. Hey?"</p>

<p>"How long before sunset now?" asked Buck Daniels sharply.</p>

<p>"Maybe a couple of hours."</p>

<p>"A couple of hours," repeated Daniels, and ground his knuckles
across his forehead. "A couple of hours!"</p>

<p>He raised his glass with a jerky motion and downed the contents;
the chaser stood disregarded before him and O'Brien regarded his
patron with an eye of admiration.</p>

<p>"You long for these parts?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, I'm strange to this range. Riding up north pretty soon, if
I can get someone to tell me the lay of the land. D'you know
it?"</p>

<p>"Never been further north than Brownsville."</p>

<p>"Couldn't name me someone that's travelled about, I s'pose?"</p>

<p>"Old Gary Peters knows every rock within three day's riding. He
keeps the blacksmith shop across the way."</p>

<p>"So? Thanks; I'll look him up."</p>

<p>Buck Daniels found the blacksmith seated on a box before his
place of business; it was a slack time for Gary Peters and he
consoled himself for idleness by chewing the stem of an unlighted
corn-cob, whose bowl was upside down. His head was pulled down and
forward as if by the weight of his prodigious sandy moustache, and
he regarded a vague horizon with misty eyes.</p>

<p>"Seen you comin' out of O'Brien's," said the blacksmith, as Buck
took possession of a nearby box. "What's the news?"</p>

<p>"Ain't any news," responded Buck dejectedly. "Too much talk; no
news."</p>

<p>"That's right," nodded Gary Peters. "O'Brien is the
out-talkingest man I ever see. Ain't nobody on Brownsville can get
his tongue around so many words as O'Brien."</p>

<p>So saying, he blew through his pipe, picked up a stick of soft
pine, and began to whittle it to a point.</p>

<p>"In my part of the country," went on Buck Daniels, "they don't
lay much by a man that talks a pile."</p>

<p>Here the blacksmith turned his head slowly, regarded his
companion for an instant, and then resumed his whittling.</p>

<p>"But," said Daniels, with a sigh, "if I could find a man that
knowed the country north of Brownsville and had a hobble on his
tongue I could give him a night's work that'd be worth while."</p>

<p>Gary Peters removed his pipe from his mouth and blew out his
dropping moustaches. He turned one wistful glance upon his idle
forge; he turned a sadder eye upon his companion.</p>

<p>"I could name you a silent man or two in Brownsville," he said,
"but there ain't only one man that knows the country right."</p>

<p>"That so? And who might he be?"</p>

<p>"Me."</p>

<p>"You?" echoed Daniels in surprise. He turned and considered Gary
as if for the first time. "Maybe you know the lay of the land up as
far as Hawkin's Arroyo?"</p>

<p>"Me? Son, I know every cactus clear to Bald Eagle."</p>

<p>"H-m-m!" muttered Daniels. "I s'pose maybe you could name some
of the outfits from here on a line with Bald Eagle&mdash;say you
put 'em ten miles apart?"</p>

<p>"Nothin' easier. I could find 'em blindfold. First due out
they's McCauley's. Then lay a bit west of north and you hit the
Circle K Bar&mdash;that's about twelve mile from McCauley's. Hit
'er up dead north again, by east, and you come eight miles to Three
Roads. Go on to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Partner," cut in Daniels, "I could do business with you."</p>

<p>"Maybe you could."</p>

<p>"My name's Daniels."</p>

<p>"I'm Gary Peters. H'ware you?"</p>

<p>They shook hands.</p>

<p>"Peters," said Buck Daniels, "you look square, and I need you in
square game; but there ain't any questions that go with it. Twenty
iron men for one day's riding and one day's silence."</p>

<p>"M'frien'," murmured Peters. "In my day I've gone three months
without speakin' to anything in boots; and I wasn't hired for it,
neither."</p>

<p>"You know them people up the line," said Daniels. "Do they know
you?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell a man they do! Know Gary Peters?"</p>

<p>"Partner, this is what I want. I want you to leave Brownsville
inside of ten minutes and start riding for Elkhead. I want you to
ride, and I want you to ride like hell. Every ten miles, or so, I
want you to stop at some place where you can get a fresh hoss. Get
your fresh hoss and leave the one you've got off, and tell them to
have the hoss you leave ready for me any time to-night. It'll take
you clear till to-morrow night to reach Elkhead, even with relayin'
your hosses?"</p>

<p>"Round about that, if I ride like hell. What do I take with
me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Nothing but the coin I give you to hire someone at
every stop to have that hoss you've left ready for me. Better
still, if you can have 'em, get a fresh hoss. Would they trust you
with hosses that way, Gary?"</p>

<p>"Gimme the coin and where they won't trust me I'll pay
cash."</p>

<p>"I can do it. It'll about bust me, but I can do it."</p>

<p>"You going to try for a record between Brownsville and Elkhead,
eh? Got a bet up, eh?"</p>

<p>"The biggest bet you ever heard of," said Daniels grimly. "You
can tell the boys along the road that I'm tryin' for time. Have you
got a fast hoss to start with?"</p>

<p>"Got a red mare that ain't much for runnin' cattle, but she's
greased lightnin' for a short bust."</p>

<p>"Then get her out. Saddle her up, and be on your way. Here's my
stake&mdash;I'll keep back one twenty for accidents. First gimme a
list of the places you'll stop for the relays."</p>

<p>He produced an old envelope and a stub of soft pencil with which
he jotted down Gary Peters' directions.</p>

<p>"And every second," said Buck Daniels in parting, "that you can
cut off your own time will be a second cut off'n mine. Because I'm
liable to be on your heels when you ride into Elkhead."</p>

<p>Gary Peters lifted his eyebrows and then restored his pipe. He
spoke through his teeth.</p>

<p>"You ain't got a piece of money to bet on that, partner?" he
queried softly.</p>

<p>"Ten extra if you get to Elkhead before me."</p>

<p>"They's limits to hoss-flesh," remarked Peters. "What time you
ridin' against?"</p>

<p>"Against a cross between a bullet and a nor'easter, Gary. I'm
going back to drink to your luck."</p>

<p>A promise which Buck Daniels fulfilled, for he had need of even
borrowed strength. He drank steadily until a rattle of hoofs down
the street entered the saloon, and then someone came in to say that
Gary Peters had started out of town to "beat all hell, on his red
mare."</p>

<p>After that, Buck started out to find Dan Barry. His quarry was
not in the barn nor in the corral behind the barn. There stood
Satan and Black Bart, but their owner was not in sight. But a
thought came to Buck while he looked, rather mournfully, at the
stallion's promise of limitless speed. "If I can hold him up jest
half a minute," murmured Buck to himself, "jest half a minute till
I get a start, I've got a rabbit's chance of livin' out the
night!"</p>

<p>From the door of the first shed he took a heavy chain with the
key in the padlock. This chain he looped about the post and the
main timber of the gate, snapped the padlock, and threw the key
into the distance. Then he stepped back and surveyed his work with
satisfaction. It would be a pretty job to file through that chain,
or to knock down those ponderous rails of the fence and make a gap.
A smile of satisfaction came on the face of Buck Daniels, then,
hitching at his belt, and pulling his sombrero lower over his eyes,
he started once more to find Dan Barry.</p>

<p>He was more in haste now, for the sun was dipping behind the
mountains of the west and the long shadows moved along the ground
with a perceptible speed. When he reached the street he found a
steady drift of people towards O'Brien's barroom. They came by ones
and twos and idled in front of the swinging doors or slyly peeked
through them and then whispered one to the other. Buck accosted one
of those by the door and asked what was wrong.</p>

<p>"He's in there," said the other, with a broad and excited grin.
"He's in there&mdash;waitin'!"</p>

<p>And when Buck threw the doors wide he saw, at the farther end of
the deserted barroom, Dan Barry, seated at a table braiding a small
horsehair chain. His hat was pushed far back on his head; he had
his back to the door. Certainly he must be quite unaware that all
Brownsville was waiting, breathless, for his destruction. Behind
the bar stood O'Brien, pale under his bristles, and his eyes never
leaving the slender figure at the end of his room; but seeing Buck
he called with sudden loudness: "Come in, stranger. Come in and
have one on the house. There ain't nothing but silence around this
place and it's getting on my nerves."</p>

<p>Buck Daniels obeyed the invitation at once, and behind him,
stepping softly, some of them entering with their hats in their
hands and on tiptoe, came a score of the inhabitants of
Brownsville. They lined the bar up and down its length; not a word
was spoken; but every head turned as at a given signal towards the
quiet man at the end of the room.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap16" name="chap16">16. THE COMING OF NIGHT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">It was not yet full dusk, for the shadows were
still swinging out from the mountains and a ghost of colour
lingered in the west, but midnight lay in the open eyes of Jerry
Strann. There had been no struggle, no outcry, no lifting of head
or hand. One instant his eyes were closed, and then, indeed, he
looked like death; the next instant the eyes open, he smiled, the
wind stirred in his bright hair. He had never seemed so happily
alive as in the moment of his death. Fatty Matthews held the mirror
close to the faintly parted lips, examined it, and then drew slowly
back towards the door, his eyes steady upon Mac Strann.</p>

<p>"Mac," he said, "it's come. I got just this to say: whatever you
do, for God's sake stay inside the law!"</p>

<p>And he slipped through the door and was gone.</p>

<p>But Mac Strann did not raise his head or cast a glance after the
marshal. He sat turning the limp hand of Jerry back and forth in
his own, and his eyes wandered vaguely through the window and down
to the roofs of the village.</p>

<p>Night thickened perceptibly every moment, yet still while the
eastern slope of every roof was jet black, the western slopes were
bright, and here and there at the distance the light turned and
waned on upper windows. Sleep was coming over the world, and
eternal sleep had come for Jerry Strann.</p>

<p>It did not seem possible.</p>

<p>Some night at sea, when clouds hurtled before the wind across
the sky and when the waves leaped up mast-high; when some good ship
staggered with the storm, when hundreds were shrieking and yelling
in fear or defiance of death; there would have been a death-scene
for Jerry Strann.</p>

<p>Or in the battle, when hundreds rush to the attack with one man
in front like the edge before the knife&mdash;there would have been
a death-scene for Jerry Strann. Or while he rode singing, a bolt of
lightning that slew and obliterated at once&mdash;such would have
been a death for Jerry Strann.</p>

<p>It was not possible that he could die like this, with a smile.
There was something incompleted. The fury of the death-struggle
which had been omitted must take place, and the full rage of wrath
and destruction must be vented. Can a bomb explode and make no
sound and do no injury?</p>

<p>Yet Jerry Strann was dead and all the world lived on. Someone
cantered his horse down the street and called gayly to an
acquaintance, and afterwards the dust rose, invisible, and blew
through the open window and stung the nostrils of Mac Strann. A
child cried, faintly, in the distance, and then was hushed by the
voice of the mother, making a sound like a cackling hen. This was
all!</p>

<p>There should have been wailing and weeping and cursing and
praying, for handsome Jerry Strann was dead. Or there might have
been utter and dreadful silence and waiting for the stroke of
vengeance, for the brightest eye was misted and the strongest hand
was unnerved and the voice that had made them tremble was gone.</p>

<p>But there was neither silence nor weeping. Someone in a nearby
kitchen rattled her pans and then cursed a dog away from her
back-door. Not that any of the sounds were loud. The sounds of
living are rarely loud, but they run in an endless river&mdash;a
monotone broken by ugly ripples of noise to testify that men still
sleep or waken, hunger or feed. Another ripple had gone down to the
sea of darkness, yet all the ripples behind it chased on their way
heedlessly and babbled neither louder nor softer.</p>

<p>There should have been some giant voice to peal over the
sleeping village and warn them of the coming vengeance&mdash;for
Jerry Strann was dead!</p>

<p>The tall, gaunt figure of Haw-Haw Langley came on tiptoe from
behind, beheld the dead face, and grinned; a nervous convulsion
sent a long ripple through his body, and his Adam's-apple rose and
fell. Next he stole sideways, inch by inch, so gradual was his
cautious progress, until he could catch a glimpse of Mac Strann's
face. It was like the open face of a child; there was in it no
expression except wonder.</p>

<p>At length a hoarse voice issued from between the grinning lips
of Haw-Haw.</p>

<p>"Ain't you goin' to close the eyes, Mac?"</p>

<p>At this the great head of Mac Strann rolled back and he raised
his glance to Haw-Haw, who banished the grin from his mouth by a
vicious effort.</p>

<p>"Ain't he got to see his way?" asked Mac Strann, and lowered his
glance once more to the dead man. As for Haw-Haw Langley, he made a
long, gliding step back towards the door, and his beady eyes opened
in terror; yet a deadly fascination drew him back again beside the
bed.</p>

<p>Mac Strann said: "Kind of looks like Jerry was ridin' the home
trail, Haw-Haw. See the way he's smilin'?"</p>

<p>The vulture stroked his lean cheeks and seemed once more to
swallow his silent mirth.</p>

<p>"And his hands," said Mac Strann, "is just like life, except
that they's gettin' sort of chilly. He don't look changed, none,
does he, Haw-Haw? Except that he's seein' something off
there&mdash;away off there. Looks like he was all wrapped up in it,
eh?" He leaned closer, his voice fell to a murmur that was almost
soft. "Jerry, what you seein'?"</p>

<p>Haw-Haw Langley gasped in inaudible terror and retreated again
towards the door.</p>

<p>Mac Strann laid his giant hand on the shoulder of Jerry. He
asked in a raised voice: "Don't you hear me, lad?" Sudden terror
caught hold of him. He plunged to his knees beside the bed, and the
floor quaked and groaned under the shock. "Jerry, what's the
matter? Are you mad at me? Ain't you going to speak to me? Are you
forgettin' me, Jerry?"</p>

<p>He caught the dead face between his hands and turned it strongly
towards his own. Then for a moment his eyes plumbed the shadows
into which they looked. He stumbled back to his feet and said
apologetically to Haw-Haw at the door: "I kind of forgot he wasn't
livin', for a minute." He stared fixedly at the gaunt cowpuncher.
"Speakin' man to man, Haw-Haw, d'you think Jerry will forget
me?"</p>

<p>The terror was still white upon the face of Haw-Haw, but
something stronger than fear kept him in the room and even drew him
a slow step towards Mac Strann; and his eyes moved from the face of
the dead man to the face of the living and seemed to draw
sustenance from both. He moistened his lips and was able to
speak.</p>

<p>"Forget you, Mac? Not if you get the man that fixed him."</p>

<p>"Would you want me to get him, Jerry?" asked Mac Strann. And he
waited for an answer.</p>

<p>"I dunno," he muttered, after a moment. "Jerry was always for
fightin', but he wasn't never for killin'. He never liked the way I
done things. And when he was lyin' here, Haw-Haw, he never said
nothin' about me gettin' Barry. Did he?"</p>

<p>Astonishment froze the lips of Haw-Haw. He managed to stammer:
"Ain't you going to get Barry? Ain't you goin' to bust him up,
Mac?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," repeated the big man heavily. "Seems like I've got no
heart for killing. Seems like they's enough death in the world." He
pressed his hand against his forehead and closed his eyes. "Seems
like they's something dead in me. They's an ache that goes ringin'
in my head. They's a sort of hollow feelin' inside me. And I keep
thinkin' about times when I was a kid and got hurt and cried." He
drew a deep breath. "Oh, my God, Haw-Haw, I'd give most anything if
I could bust out cryin' now!"</p>

<p>While Mac Strann stood with his eyes closed, speaking his words
slowly, syllable by syllable, like the tolling of a bell, Haw-Haw
Langley stood with parted lips&mdash;like the spirit of famine
drinking deep; joy unutterable was glittering in his eyes.</p>

<p>"If Jerry'd wanted me to get this Barry, he'd of said so,"
repeated Mac Strann. "But he didn't." He turned towards the dead
face. "Look at Jerry now. He ain't thinkin' about killin's. Nope,
he's thinkin' about some quiet place for sleep. I know the place.
They's a spring that come out in a holler between two mountains;
and the wind blows up the valley all the year; and they's a tree
that stands over the spring. That's where I'll put him. He loved
the sound of runnin' water; and the wind'll be on his face; and the
tree'll sort of mark the place. Jerry, lad, would ye like
that?"</p>

<p>Now, while Mac Strann talked, inspiration came to Haw-Haw
Langley, and he stretched out his gaunt arms to it and gathered it
in to his heart.</p>

<p>"Mac," he said, "don't you see no reason why Jerry wouldn't ask
you to go after Barry?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" queried Mac Strann, turning.</p>

<p>But as he turned, Haw-Haw Langley glided towards him, and behind
him, as if he found it easier to talk when the face of Mac was
turned away. And while he talked his hands reached out towards Mac
Strann like one who is begging for alms.</p>

<p>"Mac, don't you remember that Barry beat Jerry to the draw?"</p>

<p>"What's that to do with it?"</p>

<p>"But he beat him bad to the draw. I seen it. Barry <i>waited</i>
for Jerry. Understand?"</p>

<p>"What of that?"</p>

<p>"Mac, you're blind! Jerry knowed you'd be throwing yourself away
if you went up agin Barry."</p>

<p>At this Mac Strann whirled with a suddenness surprising for one
of his bulk. Haw-Haw Langley flattened his gaunt frame against the
wall.</p>

<p>"Mac!" he pleaded, "<i>I</i> didn't say you'd be throwin'
yourself away. It was Jerry's idea."</p>

<p>"Did Jerry tell you that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"So help me God!"</p>

<p>"Did Jerry <i>want</i> me to get Barry?"</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't he?" persisted the vulture, twisting his bony
hands together in an agony of alarm and suspense. "Ain't it
nacheral, Mac?"</p>

<p>Mac Strann wavered where he stood.</p>

<p>"Somehow," he argued to himself, "it don't seem like killin' is
right, here."</p>

<p>The long hand of Langley touched his shoulder.</p>

<p>He whispered rapidly: "You remember last night when you was out
of the room for a minute? Jerry turned his head to me&mdash;jest
the way he's lyin' now&mdash;and I says: 'Jerry, is there anything
I can do for you?'"</p>

<p>Mac Strann reached up and his big fingers closed over those of
Haw-Haw.</p>

<p>"Haw-Haw," he muttered, "you was his frien'. I know that."</p>

<p>Haw-Haw gathered assurance.</p>

<p>He said: "Jerry answers to me: 'Haw-Haw, old pal, there ain't
nothin' you can do for me. I'm goin' West. But after I'm gone, keep
Mac away from Barry.'</p>

<p>"I says: 'Why, Jerry?"</p>

<p>"'Because Barry'll kill him, sure,' says Jerry.</p>

<p>"'I'll do what I can to keep him away from Barry,' says I, 'but
don't you want nothin' done to the man what killed you?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, Haw-Haw,' says Jerry, 'I ain't goin' to rest easy, I ain't
goin' to sleep in heaven&mdash;until I know Barry's been sent to
hell. But for God's sake don't let Mac know what I want, or he'd be
sure to go after Barry and get what I got.'"</p>

<p>Mac Strann crushed the hand of Haw-Haw in a terrible grip.</p>

<p>"Partner," he said, "d'you swear this is straight?"</p>

<p>"So help me God!" repeated the perjurer.</p>

<p>"Then," said Mac Strann, "I got to leave the buryin' to other
men what I'll hire. Me&mdash;I've got business on hand. Where did
Barry run to?"</p>

<p>"He ain't run," cried Haw-Haw, choking with a strange emotion.
"The fool&mdash;the damned fool!&mdash;is waiting right down here
in O'Brien's bar for you to come. He's <i>darin'</i> you to
come!"</p>

<p>Mac Strann made no answer. He cast a single glance at the
peaceful face of Jerry, and then started for the door. Haw-Haw
waited until the door closed; then he wound his arms about his
body, writhed in an ecstasy of silent laughter, and followed with
long, shambling strides.</p>

<h2><a id="chap17" name="chap17">17. BUCK MAKES HIS GET-AWAY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Straight from the room of the dead man, Fatty
Matthews had hurried down to the bar, and there he stepped into the
silence and found the battery of eyes all turned upon that calm
figure at the end of the room. Upon this man he trotted, breathing
hard, and his fat sides jostled up and down as he ran. According to
Brownsville, there were only two things that could make Fatty run:
a gun or the sight of a drink. But all maxims err. When he reached
Barry he struck him on the shoulder with a heavy hand. That is, he
struck at the shoulder, but as if the shadow of the falling hand
carried a warning before it, at the same time that it dropped Barry
swerved around in his chair. Not a hurried movement, but in some
mysterious manner his shoulder was not in the way of the plump
fist. It struck, instead, upon the back of the chair, and the
marshal cursed bitterly.</p>

<p>"Stranger," he said hotly, "I got one thing to say: Jerry Strann
has just died upstairs. In ten seconds Mac Strann will be down here
lookin' for <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>He stepped back, humming desperately to cover his wheezing, but
Barry continued to braid the horsehair with deft fingers.</p>

<p>"I got a double knot that's kind of new," he said. "Want to
watch me tie it?"</p>

<p>The deputy sheriff turned on the crowd.</p>

<p>"Boys," he exclaimed, waving his arms, "he's crazy. You heard
what he said. You know I've give him fair warning. If we got to dig
his grave in Brownsville, is it my fault? It ain't!" He stepped to
the bar and pounded upon it. "O'Brien, for God's sake, a
drink!"</p>

<p>It was a welcome suggestion to the entire nervous crowd, but
while the glasses spun across the bar Buck Daniels walked slowly
down the length of the barroom towards Barry. His face was a study
which few men could have solved; unless there had been someone
present who had seen a man walk to his execution. Beside Dan Barry
he stopped and watched the agile hands at work. There was a change
in the position of Barry now, for he had taken the chair facing the
door and the entire crowd; Buck Daniels stood opposite. The
horsehair plied back and forth. And Daniels noted the hands, lean,
tapering like the fingers of a girl of sixteen. They were perfectly
steady; they were the hands of one who had struggled, in life, with
no greater foe than ennui.</p>

<p>"Dan," said Buck, and there was a quiver of excitement in his
voice, like the tremor of a piano string long after it has been
struck. "Dan, I been thinking about something and now I'm ready to
tell you what it is."</p>

<p>Barry looked up in slow surprise.</p>

<p>Now the face of Buck Daniels held what men have called a "deadly
pallor," that pallor which comes over one who is cornered and about
to fight for his life. He leaned closer, resting one hand upon the
edge of the table, so that his face was close to Dan Barry.</p>

<p>"Barry," he said, "I'm askin' you for the last time: Will you
get your hoss and ride back to Kate Cumberland with me?"</p>

<p>Dan Barry smiled his gentle, apologetic smile.</p>

<p>"I don't no ways see how I can, Buck."</p>

<p>"Then," said Buck through his teeth, "of all the lyin' hounds in
the world you're the lyin'est and meanest and lowest. Which they
ain't words to tell you what I think of you. Take this
instead!"</p>

<p>And the hand which rested on the table darted up and smote Dan
Barry on the cheek, a tingling blow. With the same motion which
started his hand for the blow, Buck Daniels turned on his heel and
stepped a pace or two towards the centre of the room.</p>

<p>There was not a man in the room who had not heard the last words
of Buck Daniels, and not a man who had not seen the blow. Everyone
of them had seen, or heard accurately described, how the slender
stranger beat Jerry Strann to the draw and shot him down in that
same place. Such a moan came from them as when many men catch their
breath with pain, and with a simultaneous movement those who were
in line with Buck Daniels and Barry leaped back against the bar on
one side and against the wall on the other. Their eyes, fascinated,
held on the face of Barry, and they saw the pale outline which the
fingers of Daniels had left on the cheek of the other. But if
horror was the first thing they felt, amazement was the next. For
Dan Barry sat bolt erect in his chair, staring in an astonishment
too great for words. His right hand hung poised and moveless just
above the butt of his gun; his whole posture was that of one in the
midst of an action, suspended there, frozen to stone. They waited
for that poised hand to drop, for the slender fingers to clutch the
butt of the gun, for the convulsive jerk that would bring out the
gleaming barrel, the explosion, the spurt of smoke, and Buck
Daniels lurching forward to his face on the floor.</p>

<p>But that hand did not move; and Buck Daniels? Standing there
with his back to the suspended death behind him, he drew out Durham
and brown papers, without haste, rolled a cigarette, and reached to
a hip pocket.</p>

<p>At that move Dan Barry started. His hand darted down and
fastened on his gun, and he leaned forward in his chair with the
yellow glimmering light flaring up in his eyes. But the hand of
Buck Daniels came out from his hip bearing a match. He raised his
leg, scratched the match, there was a blue spurt of flame, and Buck
calmly lighted his cigarette and started towards the door,
sauntering.</p>

<p>The instant the swinging doors closed Barry started from his
chair with a strange cry&mdash;none of them had ever heard the like
from human lips&mdash;for there was grief in it, and above all
there was a deadly eagerness. So a hungry man might cry out at the
sight of food. Down the length of the barroom he darted and was
drawing his gun as he whipped through the doors. A common rush
followed him, and those who reached the open first saw Buck Daniels
leaning far forward in his saddle and spurring desperately into the
gloom of the night. Instantly he was only a twinkling figure in the
shadows, and the beat of the hoofs rattled back at them. Dan Barry
stood with his gun poised high for a second or more. Then he
turned, dropped the gun into the holster, and with the same
strange, unearthly cry of eagerness, he raced off in the direction
of the barns.</p>

<p>There were some who followed him even then, and this is what
they reported to incredulous ears when they returned. Barry ran
straight for the left hand corral and wrenched at the gate, which
appeared to be secured by a lock and chain. Seeing that it would
not give way he ran around to the barn, and came out again carrying
a saddle and bridle. These he tossed over the high fence into the
corral. Then he picked up a loose scantling and with it pried and
wrenched off the top bar of the fence in one section and vaulted
into the enclosure.</p>

<p>The black stallion had whinnied once or twice during this time
and the great black, shaggy dog had come snarling and whining about
the feet of his master. Now the stranger tossed on the saddle and
cinched it with amazing speed, sprang onto his mount, and urged it
across to the other side of the corral. Up to that moment no one in
the little crowd of watchers had suspected the intention of the
rider. For the fence, even after the removal of the top bar, was
nearly six feet in height. But when Barry took his horse to the far
side of the corral and then swung him about facing the derailed
section, it was plain that he meant to attempt to jump at that
place. Even then, as O'Brien explained later, and many a time, the
thing was so impossible that he could not believe his eyes. There
was a dreamlike element to the whole event. And like a phantom in a
vision he saw the black horse start into a sharp gallop; saw the
great dog sail across the fence first; saw the horse and rider
shoot into the air against the stars; heard the click of hoofs
against the top rail; heard the thud of hoofs on the near side of
the fence, and then the horseman flashed about the corner of the
barn and in an instant his hoofs were beating a far distant
tattoo.</p>

<p>As for the watchers, they returned in a dead silence to the
barroom and they had hardly entered when Mac Strann stalked through
the doors behind them; he went straight to O'Brien.</p>

<p>"Somewhere about," he said in his thick, deep voice, "they's a
man named Dan Barry. Where is he?"</p>

<p>And O'Brien answered: "Mac, he was sittin' down there at that
table until two minutes ago, but where he is now I ain't any
idea."</p>

<p>The tall, skeleton form of Haw-Haw Langley materialised behind
Mac Strann, and his face was contorted with anger.</p>

<p>"If he was here two minutes ago," he said, "he ain't more than
two minutes away."</p>

<p>"Which way?" asked Mac Strann.</p>

<p>"North," answered a score of voices.</p>

<p>O'Brien stepped up to Mac Strann. He said: "Mac, we know what
you got in your mind. We know what you've lost, and there ain't any
of us that ain't sorry for Jerry&mdash;and for you. But, Mac, I can
give you the best advice you ever heard in your life: Keep off'n
the trail of Barry!"</p>

<p>Haw-Haw Langley added at the ear of Mac Strann: "That was
Jerry's advice when he lay dyin'. An' it's my advice, too. Mac,
Barry ain't a safe man to foller!"</p>

<p>"Haw-Haw," answered Mac Strann, "Will you gimme a hand saddlin'
my hoss? I got an appointment, an' I'm two minutes late
already."</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="chap18" name="chap18">18. DOCTOR BYRNE ANALYSES</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">In the room which had been assigned to his use
Doctor Randall Byrne sat down to an unfinished letter and began to
write.</p>

<p class="letter">"Dinner has interrupted me, my dear Loughburne. I
have dined opposite Miss Cumberland&mdash;only the two of us at a
great table&mdash;with a wide silence around us&mdash;and the
Chinese cook padding to and fro from the kitchen. Have I told you
of that room? No, I believe that I have made no more than casual
mention of my environment here, for reasons which are patent. But
to-night I wished that you might look in upon the scene. Along the
walls hang a rope with which Mr. Cumberland won a roping and tieing
contest in his youth&mdash;a feat upon which he prides himself
highly; at another place hang the six-shooters of a notorious
desperado, taken from his dead body; there is the sombrero of a
Mexican guerilla chief beside the picture of a prize bull, and an
oil painting of Mr. Cumberland at middle age adjoins an immense
calendar on which is portrayed the head of a girl in bright
colours&mdash;a creature with amazing quantities of straw-coloured
hair. The table itself is of such size that it is said all the
guests at a round-up&mdash;a festival of note in these barbaric
regions&mdash;can be easily seated around it. On one side of this
table I sat&mdash;and on the other side sat the girl, as far away
as if an entire room had separated us.<br>
<br>
"Before going down to the meal I had laid aside my glasses, for I
have observed that spectacles, though often beneficial to the
sight, are not always equally commendable in the opinion of women;
and it should assuredly be one's endeavour to become agreeable to
those about us.<br>
<br>
"Be it noted at this point, my dear Loughburne, that I have
observed peculiar properties in the eyes of Miss Cumberland. Those
of all other humans and animals that have fallen under my
observance were remarkable only for their use in seeing, whereas
the eyes of Miss Cumberland seem peculiarly designed to be
<i>seen</i>. This quality I attribute to the following properties
of the said eyes. First, they are in size well beyond the ordinary.
Secondly, they are of a colour restful to behold. It is, indeed,
the colour of the deep, blue evening sky into which one may stare
for an incalculable distance.<br>
<br>
"As I have said, then, I noted a glow in these eyes, though they
were so immediately lowered that I could not be sure. I felt,
however, an extraordinary warmth beneath my collar, the suffusion
of blood passing swiftly towards my forehead. I inquired if she had
smiled and for what reason; whereat she immediately assured me that
she had not, and smiled while making the assurance.<br>
<br>
"I was now possessed of an unusual agitation, augmented by the
manner in which Miss Cumberland looked at me out of twinkling but
not unkindly eyes. What could have caused this perturbation I leave
to your scientific keenness in analysis.<br>
<br>
"I discovered an amazing desire to sing, which indecorous impulse
I, of course, immediately inhibited and transferred the energy into
conversation.<br>
<br>
"'The weather,' said I. 'has been uncommonly delightful
to-day.'<br>
<br>
"I observed that Miss Cumberland greeted this sentence with another
smile.<br>
<br>
"Presently she remarked: 'It has seemed a bit windy to me.'<br>
<br>
"I recalled that it is polite to agree with ladies and instantly
subjoined with the greatest presence of mind: 'Quite right! A most
abominably stormy day!'<br>
<br>
"At this I was astonished to be greeted by another burst of
laughter, even more pronounced than the others.<br>
<br>
"'Doctor Byrne,' she said, 'you are absolutely unique.'<br>
<br>
"'It is a point,' I said earnestly, 'which I shall immediately set
about to change.'<br>
<br>
"At this she raised both hands in a gesture of protest, so that I
could observe her eyes shining behind the slender, brown
fingers&mdash;observe, Loughburne, that white skin is falsely
considered a thing of beauty in women&mdash;and she remarked, still
laughing: 'Indeed, you must not change!'<br>
<br>
"I replied with an adroit change of front: 'Certainly not.'<br>
<br>
"For some mysterious reason the girl was again convulsed and broke
off her laughter to cry in a voice of music which still tingles
through me: 'Doctor Byrne, you are delightful!'<br>
<br>
"I should gladly have heard her say more upon this point, but it
being one which I could not gracefully dispute with her, and being
unwilling that she should lapse into one of her usual silences, I
ventured to change the subject from myself to her.<br>
<br>
"'Miss Cumberland,' I said, 'I remark with much pleasure that the
anxiety which has recently depressed you seems now in some measure
lessened. I presume Mr. Daniels will be successful in his journey,
though what the return of Mr. Daniels accompanied by Mr. Barry can
accomplish, is, I confess, beyond my computation. Yet you are
happier in the prospect of Mr. Barry's return?'<br>
<br>
"I asked this question with a falling heart, though I remain
ignorant of the cause to which I can attribute my sudden
depression. Still more mysterious was the delight which I felt when
the girl shook her head slowly and answered: 'Even if he comes, it
will mean nothing.'<br>
<br>
"I said: 'Then let us intercept him and send him back!'<br>
<br>
"She cried out, as if I had hurt her: 'No, no, no!' and twisted her
fingers together in pain. She added at once: 'What of poor
Dad?'<br>
<br>
"'Your father,' I confessed, 'had for the moment slipped my
mind.'<br>
<br>
"It seemed to me, however, that it was not wholly on her father's
account that she was grieved. She wished Mr. Barry to return, and
yet she dreaded his coming. It was most mysterious. However, I had
started Miss Cumberland thinking. She stopped eating and began to
stare before her. Presently she said: 'It is strange that we don't
hear from Buck. What can have held him so long?'<br>
<br>
"I regretted extremely that I had introduced the topic and cast
about in my mind for another, but could not find one. I then
expressed regret that I had revived her worries, but received in
reply a smile in which there was no life: the very colour had died
out from her cheeks. And she sat during the rest of the meal
without speaking a word.<br>
<br>
"Afterwards I went in with her to see Mr. Cumberland. His condition
was not materially changed. The marvel of it grows upon me more and
more. It is a freak which defies medical science. There lies a man
at the point of dissolution. His body has died of old age, and yet
the life principle remains. He does not eat&mdash;at least, the
nourishment he takes is wholely negligible. But he still has
energy. To be sure, he rarely moves about and his body remains
practically inert. But we must never forget that the mind is a
muscle and calls for continual rebuilding. And the mind of Mr.
Cumberland is never inactive. It works ceaselessly. It will not
permit him to sleep. For three days, now, as far as I can tell, he
has not closed his eyes. It might be assumed that he is in a state
of trance, but by a series of careful experiments, I have
ascertained that he is constantly thinking in the most vigourous
fashion.<br>
<br>
"What does it mean? There is in the man a flame-like quality;
something is burning in him every instant. But on what does the
flame feed? I know that material cannot be created and that energy
means dissolution of matter: but why does not the life of Joseph
Cumberland dissolve?<br>
<br>
"The subject possesses me. I dare not ponder it too steadily or my
brain begins to whirl. I make no progress towards any reasonable
solution. I only feel that I am living in the presence of an
astounding mystery.<br>
<br>
"Strange thoughts possess me. What is the fire that burns but does
not consume Joe Cumberland? What is the thing in the wandering Dan
Barry which Kate Cumberland fears and yet waits for? Why was it
that Daniels trembled with dread when he started out to find a man
who, by his own profession, he holds to be his best friend?<br>
<br>
"You see how the mystery assumes shape? It is before me. It is in
my hand. And yet I cannot grasp its elements.<br>
<br>
"The story of a man, a horse, and a dog. What is the story?<br>
<br>
"To-day I wandered about the great corrals and came to one which
was bounded by a fence of extraordinary height. It was a small
corral, but all the posts were of great size, and the rails were as
large as ordinary posts. I inquired what strange beasts could be
kept in such a pen, and the man-of-all-work of whom I asked
replied: 'That's Satan's corral.'<br>
<br>
"I guessed at some odd story. 'The devil?' I cried, 'Do they fence
the devil in a corral?'<br>
<br>
"'Oh, ay,' said the fellow, 'he's a devil, right enough. If we'd
let him run with the other hosses he'd have cut 'em to ribbons.
That's what kind of a devil he is!'<br>
<br>
"A story of a man, a horse, and a dog. I think I have seen the
great chain which bound the dog. Was that the place where they kept
the horse?<br>
<br>
"And, if so, what bonds are used for the man? And what sort of man
can he be? One of gigantic size, no doubt, to mate his horse and
his dog. A fierce and intractable nature, for otherwise Kate
Cumberland could not dread him. And yet a man of singular values,
for all this place seems to wait for his return. I catch the fire
of expectancy. It eats into my flesh. Dreams haunt me night and
day. What will be the end?<br>
<br>
"Now I am going down to see Mr. Cumberland again. I know what I
shall see&mdash;the flickering of the fire behind his eyes. The
lightning glances, the gentle, rare voice, the wasted face; and by
him will be Kate Cumberland; and they both will seem to be
listening, listening&mdash;for what?<br>
<br>
"No more to-night. But, Loughburne, you should be here; I feel that
the like of this has never been upon the earth.<br>
<br>
"Byrne."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap19" name="chap19">19. SUSPENSE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">He found them as he had expected, the girl beside
the couch, and the old man prone upon it, wrapped to the chin in a
gaudy Navajo blanket. But to-night his eyes were closed, a most
unusual thing, and Byrne could look more closely at the aged face.
For on occasions when the eyes were wide, it was like looking into
the throat of a searchlight to stare at the features&mdash;all was
blurred. He discovered now wrinkled and purple-stained lids under
the deep shadow of the brows&mdash;and eyes were so sunken that
there seemed to be no pupils there. Over the cheek bones the skin
was drawn so tightly that it shone, and the cheeks fell away into
cadaverous hollows. But the lips, beneath the shag of grey beard,
were tightly compressed. No, this was not sleep. It carried, as
Byrne gazed, a connotation of swifter, fiercer thinking, than if
the gaunt old man had stalked the floor and poured forth a tirade
of words.</p>

<p>The girl came to meet the doctor. She said: "Will you use a
narcotic?"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Byrne. "He seems more quiet than usual."</p>

<p>"Look more closely," she whispered.</p>

<p>And when he obeyed, he saw that the whole body of Joe Cumberland
quivered like an aspen, continually. So the finger of the duellist
trembles on the trigger of his gun before he receives the signal to
fire&mdash;a suspense more terrible than the actual face of
death.</p>

<p>"A narcotic?" she pleaded. "Something to give him just one
moment of full relaxation?"</p>

<p>"I can't do it," said Byrne. "If his heart were a shade
stronger, I should. But as it is, the only thing that sustains him
is the force of his will-power. Do you want me to unnerve the very
strength which keeps him alive?"</p>

<p>She shuddered.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that if he sleeps it will be&mdash;death?"</p>

<p>"I have told you before," said the doctor, "that there are
phases of this case which I do not understand. I predict nothing
with certainty. But I very much fear that if your father falls into
a complete slumber he will never waken from it. Once let his brain
cease functioning and I fear that the heart will follow suit."</p>

<p>They stood on the farther side of the room and spoke in the
softest of whispers, but now the deep, calm voice of the old man
broke in: "Doc, they ain't no use of worryin'. They ain't no use of
medicine. All I need is quiet."</p>

<p>"Do you want to be alone?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"No, not so long as you don't make no noise. I can 'most hear
something, but your whisperin' shuts it off."</p>

<p>They obeyed him, with a glance at each other. And soon they
caught the far off beat of a horse in a rapid gallop.</p>

<p>"Is it that?" cried Kate, leaning forward and touching her
father's hand. "Is that horse what you hear?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" he answered impatiently. "That ain't what I hear. It
ain't no hoss that I hear!"</p>

<p>The hoof-beats grew louder&mdash;stopped before the
house&mdash;steps sounded loud and rattling on the veranda&mdash;a
door squeaked and slammed&mdash;and Buck Daniels stood before them.
His hat was jammed down so far that his eyes were almost buried in
the shadow of the brim; the bandana at his throat was twisted so
that the knot lay over his right shoulder; he carried a heavy quirt
in a hand that trembled so that the long lash seemed alive; a
thousand bits of foam had dried upon his vest and stained it; the
rowels of his spurs were caked and enmeshed with horsehair; dust
covered his face and sweat furrowed it, and a keen scent of
horse-sweat passed from him through the room. For a moment he stood
at the door, bracing himself with legs spread wide apart, and
stared wildly about&mdash;then he reeled drunkenly across the room
and fell into a chair, sprawling at full length.</p>

<p>No one else moved. Joe Cumberland had turned his head; Kate
stood with her hand at her throat; the doctor had placed his hand
behind his head, and there it stayed.</p>

<p>"Gimme smoke&mdash;quick!" said Buck Daniels. "Run out of Durham
a thousan' years ago!"</p>

<p>Kate ran into the next room and returned instantly with papers
and a fresh sack of tobacco. On these materials Buck seized
frantically, but his big fingers were shaking in a palsy, and the
papers tore, one after another, as soon as he started to roll his
smoke. "God!" he cried, in a burst of childish desperation, and
collapsed again in the chair.</p>

<p>But Kate Cumberland picked up the papers and tobacco which he
had dashed to the floor and rolled a cigarette with deft fingers.
She placed it between his lips and held the match by which he
lighted it. Once, twice, and again, he drew great breaths of smoke
into his lungs, and then he could open his eyes and look at them.
They were not easy eyes to meet.</p>

<p>"You're hungry, Buck," she said. "I can see it at a glance. I'll
have something for you in an instant."</p>

<p>He stopped her with a gesture.</p>

<p>"I done it!" said Buck Daniels. "He's comin'!"</p>

<p>The doctor flashed his glance upon Kate Cumberland, for when she
heard the words she turned pale and her eyes and her lips framed a
mute question; but Joe Cumberland drew in a long breath and
smiled.</p>

<p>"I knowed it!" he said softly.</p>

<p>The wind whistled somewhere in the house and it brought Buck
Daniels leaping to his feet and into the centre of the room.</p>

<p>"He's here!" he yelled. "God help me, where'll I go now! He's
here!"</p>

<p>He had drawn his revolver and stood staring desperately about
him as if he sought for a refuge in the solid wall. Almost
instantly he recovered himself, however, and dropped the gun back
into the holster.</p>

<p>"No, not yet," he said, more to himself than the others. "It
ain't possible, even for Dan."</p>

<p>Kate Cumberland rallied herself, though her face was still
white. She stepped to Buck and took both his hands.</p>

<p>"You've been working yourself to death," she said gently. "Buck,
you're hysterical. What have you to fear from Dan? Isn't he your
friend? Hasn't he proved it a thousand times?"</p>

<p>Her words threw him into a fresh frenzy.</p>

<p>"If he gets me, it's blood on your head, Kate. It was for you I
done it."</p>

<p>"No, no, Buck. For Dan's sake alone. Isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>"For <i>his</i> sake?" Buck threw back his head and
laughed&mdash;a crazy laughter. "He could rot in hell for all of
me. He could foller his wild geese around the world. Kate, it was
for you!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" she pleaded. "Buck, dear!"</p>

<p>"Do I care who knows it? Not I! I got an hour&mdash;half an hour
to live; and while I live the whole damned world can know I love
you, Kate, from your spurs to the blue of your eyes. For your sake
I brung him, and for your sake I'll fight him, damn him, in
spite&mdash;"</p>

<p>The wind wailed again, far off, and Buck Daniels cowered back
against the wall. He had drawn Kate with him, and he now kept her
before him, towards the door.</p>

<p>He began to whisper, swiftly, with a horrible tremble in his
voice: "Stand between me, Kate. Stand between me and him. Talk for
me, Kate. Will you talk for me?" He drew himself up and caught a
long, shuddering breath. "What have I been doin'? What have I been
ravin' about?"</p>

<p>He looked about as if he saw the others for the first time.</p>

<p>"Sit here, Buck," said Kate, with perfect quiet. "Give me your
hat. There's nothing to fear. Now tell us."</p>

<p>"A whole day and a whole night," he said, "I been riding with
the fear of him behind me. Kate, I ain't myself, and if I been
sayin' things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No matter. Only tell me how you made him follow you."</p>

<p>Buck Daniels swept his knuckles across his forehead, as though
to rub out a horrible memory.</p>

<p>"Kate," he said in a voice which was hardly more than a whisper,
"why did he follow Jim Silent?"</p>

<p>The doctor slipped into a chair opposite Buck Daniels and
watched him with unbelieving eyes. When he had last seen Buck the
man had seemed an army in himself; but now a shivering, unmanned
coward sat before him. Byrne glanced at Kate Cumberland for
explanation of the mysterious change. She, also, was transformed
with horror, and she stared at Buck Daniels as at one already among
the dead.</p>

<p>"Buck, you didn't&mdash;<i>strike</i> him?"</p>

<p>Buck Daniels nodded jerkily.</p>

<p>"I'll try to tell you straight from the beginning. I found Dan
in Brownsville. I begged him to come back with me, but he wouldn't
stir. This was why: A gunman had come to the town lookin' for
trouble, and when he run acrost Dan he found plenty of it. No,
don't look like that, Kate; it was self-defense, pure and
simple&mdash;they didn't even arrest Dan for it. But this dyin'
man's brother, Mac Strann, come down from the hills and sat beside
Jerry Strann waitin' for him to go west before he started out to
clean up on Dan. Yesterday evenin' Jerry was near dead and
everybody in Brownsville was waitin' to see what would happen,
because Dan wouldn't budge till Mac Strann had had his chance to
get back at him. So I sent a feller ahead to fix a relay of hosses
to Elkhead, because I made up my mind I was going to make Dan Barry
chase me out of that town. I walked into the saloon where Dan was
sittin'&mdash;braidin' a little horsehair strand&mdash;my God,
Kate, think of him sittin' there doin' that with a hundred fellers
standin' about waitin' for him to kill or be killed! I went up to
him. I picked a fight, and then I slapped him&mdash;in the
face."</p>

<p>The sweat started on Daniels' forehead at the thought.</p>

<p>"But you're still alive" cried Kate Cumberland. "Had you handled
his gun first?"</p>

<p>"No. As soon as I hit him I turned my back to him and took a
couple of steps away from him."</p>

<p>"Oh, Buck, Buck!" she cried, her face lighting. "You knew he
wouldn't shoot you in the back!"</p>

<p>"I didn't know nothin'. I couldn't even think&mdash;and my body
was numb as a dead man's all below the hips. There I stood like I
was chained to the floor&mdash;you know how it is in a nightmare
when something chases you and you can't run? That was the way with
me."</p>

<p>"Buck! And he was sitting behind you&mdash;while you stood
there?"</p>

<p>"Ay, sitting there with my death sittin' on his trigger finger.
But I knowed that if I showed the white feather, if I let him see
me shake, he'd be out of his chair and on top of me. No
gun&mdash;he don't need nothin' but his hands&mdash;and what was in
front of my eyes was a death like&mdash;like Jim Silent's!"</p>

<p>He squinted his eyes close and groaned. Once more he roused
himself.</p>

<p>"But I couldn't move a foot without my knees bucklin', so I
takes out my makin's and rolls a cigarette. And while I was doin'
it I was prayin' that my strength would come back to me before he
come back to himself&mdash;and started!"</p>

<p>"It was surprise that held him, Buck. To think of you striking
him&mdash;you who have saved his life and fought for him like a
blood-brother. Oh, Buck, of all the men in the world you're the
bravest and the noblest!"</p>

<p>"They ain't nothin' in that brand of talk," growled Buck,
reddening. "Anyway, at last I started for the door. It wasn't
farther away than from here to the wall. Outside was my hoss, and a
chance for livin'. But that door was a thousand years away, and a
thousand times while I walked towards it I felt Dan's gun click and
bang behind me and felt the lead go tearin' through me. And I
didn't dare to hurry, because I knew that might wake Dan up. So
finally I got to the doors and just as they was swingin' to behind
me, I heard a sort of a moan behind me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From Dan!" whispered the white-faced girl. "I know&mdash;a sort
of a stifled cry when he's angered! Oh, Buck."</p>

<p>"My first step took me ten yards from that door," reminisced
Buck Daniels, "and my next step landed me in the saddle, and I dug
them spurs clean into the insides of Long Bess. She started like a
watch-spring uncoilin', and as she spurts down the streets I leans
clean over to her mane and looks back and there I seen Dan standin'
in the door with his gun in his hand and the wind blowin' his hair.
But he didn't shoot, because the next second I was swallowed up in
the dark and couldn't see him no more."</p>

<p>"But it was no use!" cried the girl. "With Black Bart to trail
you and with Satan to carry him, he overtook you&mdash;and
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He didn't," said Buck Daniels. "I'd fixed things so's he
couldn't get started with Satan for some time. And before he could
have Satan on my trail I'd jut put a long stretch behind me because
Long Bess was racin' every step. The lay of the land was with me.
It was pretty level, and on level goin' Long Bess is almost as fast
as Satan; but on rocky goin' Satan is like a goat&mdash;nothin'
stops him! And I was ridin' Long Bess like to bust her heart,
straight towards McCauley's. We wasn't more'n a mile away when I
thought&mdash;the wind was behind me, you see&mdash;that I heard a
sort of far off whistling down the wind! My God!"</p>

<p>He could not go on for a moment, and Kate Cumberland sat with
parted lips, twisting her fingers together and then tearing them
apart once more.</p>

<p>"Well, that mile was the worst in my life. I thought maybe the
man I'd sent on ahead hadn't been able to leave me a relay at
McCauley's, and if he hadn't I knew I'd die somewhere in the hills
beyond. And they looked as black as dead men, and all sort of
grinnin' down at me.</p>

<p>"But when I got to McCauley's, there stood a hoss right in front
of the house. It didn't take me two second to make the
saddle-change. And then I was off agin!"</p>

<p>A sigh of relief came from Byrne and Kate.</p>

<p>"That hoss was a beauty. Not long-legged like Bess, nor half so
fast, but he was jest right for the hills. Climbed like a goat and
didn't let up. Up and up we goes. The wind blows the clouds away
when we gets to the top of the climb and I looks down into the
valley all white in the moonlight. And across the valley I seen two
little shadows slidin', smooth and steady. It was Dan and Satan and
Black Bart!"</p>

<p>"Buck!"</p>

<p>"My heart, it stood plumb still! I gives my hoss the spurs and
we went down the next slope. And I don't remember nothin' except
that we got to the Circle K Bar after a million years, 'most, and
when we got there the piebald flops on the ground&mdash;near dead.
But I made the change and started off agin, and that next hoss was
even better than the piebald&mdash;a sure goer! When he started I
could tell by his gait what he was, and I looked up at the
sky&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, embarrassed.</p>

<p>"And thanked God, Buck?"</p>

<p>"Kate, I ain't ashamed if maybe I did. But since then I ain't
seen or heard Dan, but all the time I rode I was expecting to hear
his whistle behind me, close up."</p>

<p>All the life died from her face.</p>

<p>"No, Buck, if he'd a followed all the way he would have caught
you in spite of your relay. No, I understand what happened. After a
while he remembered that Mac Strann was waiting for him back in
Brownsville. And he left your trail to be taken up later and went
back to Brownsville. You didn't see him follow you after you left
the Circle X Bar?"</p>

<p>"No. I didn't dare look back. But somehow I knew he was
comin'."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"He won't come, Buck. He'll go back to meet Mac Strann&mdash;and
then&mdash;" She ran to the chair of Buck swiftly and caught his
hands: "What sort of a man is Mac Strann?"</p>

<p>But Buck smiled strangely up into her face.</p>

<p>"Does it make any difference," he said, "to Dan?"</p>

<p>She went slowly back to her place.</p>

<p>"No," she admitted, "no difference."</p>

<p>"If you came by relays for twenty-four hours," said the doctor,
numbering his points upon accurate fingertips, "it is humanly
impossible that this man could have followed you very closely. It
will probably take him another day to arrive."</p>

<p>But here his glance fell upon old Joe Cumberland, and found the
cattleman smiling faintly to himself.</p>

<p>Buck Daniels was considering the last remark seriously.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "it <i>ain't</i> possible. Besides, what Kate
says may be true. She ought to know&mdash;she says he'll wait for
Mac Strann. I didn't think of that; I thought I was savin' Dan from
another&mdash;well, what a damn fool I been!"</p>

<p>He unknotted his bandana and with it mopped his face to a
semblance of cleanliness.</p>

<p>"It was the ridin' that done it," he explained, shame-faced.
"You put a man on a hoss for a certain time, and after a while he
gets so he can't think. He's sort of nutty. That was the way with
me when I come in."</p>

<p>"Open the window on the veranda," said Joe Cumberland. "I want
to feel the wind."</p>

<p>The doctor obeyed the instruction, and again he noted that same
quiet, contented smile on the lips of the old man. For some reason
it made him ill at ease to see it.</p>

<p>"He won't get here for eight or ten hours," went on Buck
Daniels, easing himself into a more comfortable position, and
raising his head a little higher. "Ten hours more, even if he does
come. That'll give me a chance to rest up; right now I'm kind of
shaky."</p>

<p>"A condition, you will observe, in which Mr. Barry will also be
when he arrives," remarked the doctor.</p>

<p>"Shaky?" grinned Buck Daniels. "M'frien', you don't know that
bird!" He sat up, clenching his fist. "And if Dan <i>does</i> come,
he can't affo'd to press me too far! I'll take so much, and
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>He struck his fist on the arm of the chair.</p>

<p>"Buck!" cried Kate Cumberland. "Are you mad? Have you lost your
reason? Would you <i>face</i> him?"</p>

<p>Buck Daniels winced, but he then shook his head doggedly.</p>

<p>"He had his chance down in Brownsville," he said. "And he didn't
take it. Why? Because my back was turned? Well, he could of got in
front of me if he'd been terrible anxious. I've seen Dan in action;
he's seen <i>me</i> in action! Maybe he's seen too much. They've
been stranger things than that, in this world!" He hitched his belt
so that the butt of his revolver came farther forward. But now Kate
Cumberland advised: "Buck, you're tired out; you don't know what
you're saying. Better go up to bed."</p>

<p>He flushed a ruddy bronze.</p>

<p>"D'you think I'm jest talkin' words, Kate, to hear myself
talk?"</p>

<p>"Listen!" broke in Joe Cumberland, and raised a bony forefinger
for silence.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>And the doctor noted a great change in the old man. There was no
longer a tremor in his body. There was only a calm and smiling
expectation&mdash;a certainty. A tinge of colour was in his
withered face for the first time since Byrne had come to the ranch,
and now the cattleman raised his finger with such an air of calm
authority that at once every voice in the room was stilled.</p>

<p>"D'ye hear?"</p>

<p>They did not. They heard only the faint rushing of the air
through the window. The flame danced in the chimney of the lamp and
changed the faces in phantastic alteration. One and all, they
turned and faced the window. Still there was not a sound audible,
but the doctor felt as if the noise were approaching. He knew it as
surely as if he could see some far-off object moving near and
nearer. And he knew, as clearly, that the others in the room felt
the same thing. He turned his glance from the window towards Kate
Cumberland. Her face was upturned. There was about it a transparent
pallor; the eyes were large and darkly ringed; the lips parted into
the saddest and the most patient of smiles; and the slender fingers
were interwoven and pressed against the base of her throat.</p>

<p>For the first time he saw how the fire that was so manifest in
the old man had been consuming her, also. It left no mark of the
coming of death upon her. But it had burned her pure and left her
transparent as crystal. Pity swelled in the throat of Byrne as he
realised the anguish of her long waiting. Fear mingled with his
pity. He felt that something was coming which would seize on her as
the wind seizes on the dead leaf, whirling her off into an infinity
of storm and darkness into which he could not follow a single
pace.</p>

<p>He turned back towards the window. The rush of air played
steadily, and then in pulses, upon his face. Then even the wind
ceased; as if it, too, were waiting. Not a sound. But silence has a
greater voice than discord or music. It seemed to Byrne that he
could tell how fast each heart was beating.</p>

<p>The old man had closed his eyes again. And yet the rigid
forefinger remained raised, and the faint smile touched at the
corners of his mouth. Buck Daniels sat lunging forward in his
chair, his knees supporting his elbows, and scowled up at the
window with a sort of sullen terror.</p>

<p>Then Byrne heard it&mdash;so small a voice that at first he
thought it was only a part of the silence. It grew and
grew&mdash;in a sudden burst it was clear to every ear&mdash;the
honking of the wild geese!</p>

<p>And Byrne knew the picture they made. He could see them far up
in the sky&mdash;a dim triangle of winter grey&mdash;moving with
the beat of lightning wings each in an arrowy flight north, and
north, and north. Creatures for sport all the world over; here
alone, in all the earth, in the heart of this mountain-desert, they
were in some mysterious wise messengers. Once more the far discord
showered down upon them, died as they rose, perhaps, to a higher
level, and was heard no more.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap20" name="chap20">20. THE COMING</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Then a padding step, light, lighter than the sound
of the softest thought. It was passing near; the faint breeze blew
the sound to them, around them, behind them. Each man felt as if
some creature were stalking him, unseen. Next&mdash;it appeared by
magic against the blue black of the night&mdash;the head of a great
wolf, quite black, shaggy, with sharply pointed ears. And the eyes
stared at them, green eyes with lights that swirled as the flame
jumped in the throat of the lamp. For a long moment the horror
lasted. Then the head, as it had come, disappeared, and the light,
light foot fall, faded away.</p>

<p>Buck Daniels had risen, now. The sound of his whisper made them
start.</p>

<p>"I'm going up&mdash;to my room&mdash;and lock the door&mdash;for
God's sake&mdash;keep&mdash;him away!"</p>

<p>And so he stole soundlessly away, and then they heard the creaks
which announced his progress up the stairs.</p>

<p>Not Buck Daniels alone. In the deadly silence Kate rose to her
feet; and the old man, the invalid&mdash;he with the dead body and
the living brain, rose from his couch and stood as erect as a
soldier on parade. The doctor was conscious of repeating to
himself, hurriedly, a formula something like this: "The thing which
is coming is human; it cannot be more than human; as long as it is
human it is nothing to fear; the laws of truth are irrevocably
fixed; the laws of science will not change." Yet in spite of this
formula he was deadly cold, as if a wind were blowing through his
naked soul. It was not fear. It was something beyond fear, and he
would not have been otherwhere for any reward. All his mind
remained poised, expectant, as the astronomer waits for the new
star which his calculations have predicted to enter the field of
his telescope.</p>

<p>He caught the sound of another horse coming, far different even
to his unpracticed ear from the beat of hoofs which announced the
coming of Buck Daniels. The rhythm of their fall was slower, as if
the stride of the animal were much longer. He pictured a mighty
creature with a vast mane blown back against the chest of a giant
rider. There was a murmur from Kate: "Dan, my dear, my dear!"</p>

<p>Then he heard a padding footfall, hardly louder than the light,
light step of the wolf. The knob of the door turned slowly, without
a sound; it opened, and a man stepped in. He was not larger than
the doctor&mdash;a slender fellow, almost dapper in his dress, with
hardly a sign of travel about him, except that the brim of his
sombrero was folded back from his face as if from continual
pressure of wind. These things Randall Byrne noted vaguely; what he
was sharply aware of were the eyes of the man. He had the feeling
that he had seen them before; he remembered the yellow light that
had swirled in the eyes of the wolf at the window.</p>

<p>The newcomer flashed a glance about the room, yet for all its
speed it seemed to linger an instant on each face, and when it
crossed the stare of Byrne the doctor shrank.</p>

<p>"Where is Buck?" asked the man. "I've come for him!"</p>

<p>As if in answer, the great, shaggy dog slipped through the
entrance past his master and glided across the room. As he passed,
Kate held out a hand to him. She called softly: "Bart!" but she was
greeted with a silent baring of fangs; and she caught her hand back
against her breast, with the tears springing in her eyes. On the
other side of the room the black dog paused and looked back to his
master, while Byrne realised with a shudder that the door before
which it stood was the door through which Buck Daniels had
disappeared. Straight to that door Barry stepped, and Byrne
realised, with an eerie emotion, that the footfalls made no
sound.</p>

<p>Before he reached the door, however, the girl started forward
and sprang before him. With her outstretched arms she barred the
way. Her skirt brushed almost in the face of the dog, and the beast
shrank away not in fear, but crouching in readiness to leap. The
sharp ears twitched back; a murderous snarl rolled up from between
the wicked teeth. Yet she did not cast a single glance at him; she
faced the greater danger.</p>

<p>She was saying: "Whatever Buck did, it wasn't done to hurt you,
Dan; it was done for your own sake. And for Dad's sake. You shan't
pass here!"</p>

<p>From his position, the doctor could not see the face of Dan
Barry, but he guessed at it through the expression of Kate. Such
terror and horror were in her eyes as though she were facing a
death's head inches away. Then he saw the slender hand of Barry
rise and move towards the girl, slowly, tremblingly, as though one
fierce impulse urged him to thrust her to one side and as though
another held back his arm. The doctor could not watch the girl
longer; fear and pity were wringing him as he lowered his glance to
the floor.</p>

<p>Then he heard her cry: "Have you forgotten me, like Bart? Like
Bart, have you forgotten me, Dan?"</p>

<p>His hand fell to his side and he glided back from her; but now
Byrne could see that the eyes of Barry were looking past the girl,
as though he stared through the solid wood of the door and found
his prey beyond it. The stranger slipped towards the door by which
he had entered, with the great dog slinking at his heels. Kate
Cumberland leaned heavily against the wall, her arm thrown across
her face, but there was no consciousness of her in the face of
Barry. Yet at the very door he paused and straightened; Byrne saw
that he was staring towards Joe Cumberland; and the old man reached
a bony hand out.</p>

<p>"Oh, lad," he said softly, "I been waitin' for you years an'
years, seems like!"</p>

<p>Barry crossed the room as noiselessly, as swiftly, as a flying
shadow.</p>

<p>"Sit down!" he commanded, and Byrne caught a faint ring in the
voice, like the shiver of metal striking steel.</p>

<p>Joe Cumberland obeyed without a word, and then lay back at full
length upon the couch&mdash;a palsy had seized on him, and the hand
which rested on the shoulder of Dan Barry was shaking. By the couch
came the tall dog, and crouched, staring up in the master's face;
then the younger man turned his face towards Byrne and the girl.
Those thin-cut nostrils expanded, the lips compressed, and Byrne
dared not look into the flare of the eyes.</p>

<p>"Who done this?" asked Barry, and still the shiver of cold metal
rang in his voice. "Who's done this?"</p>

<p>"Steady, lad," said Joe Cumberland faintly. "They ain't no call
for fightin'. Steady, Dan, boy. An' don't leave me!"</p>

<p>Byrne caught a signal from Kate and followed her obediently from
the room.</p>

<p>"Let them be alone," she said.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" protested the doctor. "Your father is lapsed into
a most dangerous condition. The physical inertia which has held him
for so long is now broken and I look for a dangerous mental and
nervous collapse to accompany it. A sedative is now
imperative!"</p>

<p>He laid his hand on the knob of the door to return, but the girl
blocked his way.</p>

<p>"Don't go in," she commanded feebly. "I can't explain to you.
All I can say is that Dad was the one who found Dan Barry and
there's something between them that none of us understand. But I
know that he can help Dad. I know Dad is in no danger while Dan is
with him."</p>

<p>"A pleasant superstition," nodded the doctor, "but medicine, my
dear Miss Cumberland, does not take account of such things."</p>

<p>"Doctor Byrne," she said, rallying a failing strength for the
argument, "I insist. Don't ask me to explain."</p>

<p>"In that case," he answered coldly, "I cannot assume
responsibility for what may happen."</p>

<p>She made a gesture of surrender, weakly.</p>

<p>"Look back in on them now," she said. "If you don't find father
quiet, you may go in to him."</p>

<p>Doctor Byrne obeyed, opening the door softly. He saw Joe
Cumberland prone, of course, upon the couch. One hand lay as usual
across his breast, but the other was at his side, clasped in the
hands of Dan Barry. The old cattleman slept. Yes, there was no
doubt that for the first time in many days he slumbered soundly.
The lean, narrow chest rose and fell with deep, slow breaths; the
eyes were closed, and there was no twitching of muscles to betray
ragged nerves or a mind that dreamed fiercely while the body slept.
Far over the sleeping man leaned the stranger, as if he were
peering closely into the closed eyes of Joe Cumberland. There was a
tenseness of watching and waiting in his attitude, like the runner
on the mark, or like the burden-bearer lifting a great weight, and
Byrne gathered, in some mysterious manner, the impression that
Barry sent through his hands and into the body of Cumberland a
continual stream of nervous strength&mdash;an electric thing.
Nonsense, of course. And it was nonsense, also, to think that the
huge dog which lay staring up into the face of the master
understood all this affair much better than the practiced mind of
the physician. Yet the illusion held with Randall Byrne in spite of
all his scepticism.</p>

<p>He was certain that he had made not the slightest sound in
opening the door, but presently the head of the watcher turned
slowly, and Byrne was looking into those same yellow, terrible
eyes. At the same instant the sick man moaned faintly. The doctor
closed the door as softly as he had opened it and turned a drawn
face upon Kate Cumberland.</p>

<p>"I don't understand; it isn't possible!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"No one understands," said the girl, and smiled mirthlessly.
"Don't try to, Doctor Byrne. Go to bed, and sleep. If you can. Good
night."</p>

<p>"But you," said Byrne, following her, "are almost as ill as your
father. Is there nothing I can do for you?"</p>

<p>"You?" she asked, surprised. "No, nothing."</p>

<p>"But there's not the slightest colour in your face. And you are
trembling, Miss Cumberland!"</p>

<p>She did not seem to hear him.</p>

<p>"Will he stay?" she asked of herself. "Will he leave before the
morning?"</p>

<p>"I shall see that he stays," said the doctor. "I will stay here
outside the door and see that he does not leave, if you wish."</p>

<p>Once more she smiled in that baffling manner.</p>

<p>"Could you keep the wind from blowing, Doctor Byrne? If I
thought that he could be kept&mdash;" she stopped. "He has
forgotten us. He has forgotten all of us except Dad. And if Dad
cannot keep him, nothing will keep him. It's useless for you to
wait here. Good night again, Doctor Byrne."</p>

<p>He watched her up the stairs. By the dim light he saw her hand
catching at the balustrade as if she were drawing herself up, step
by step. When she reached the landing and turned half towards him,
he saw that her head was fallen.</p>

<p>"Not a glance, not a thought for me," murmured the doctor. "But
if the stranger <i>does</i> leave&mdash;" Instead of finishing the
muttered sentences, he drew a chair back against the wall and sat
down with folded hands to wait.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap21" name="chap21">21. MAC STRANN DECIDES TO KEEP THE
LAW</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">It was hours later that night when Haw-Haw Langley
and Mac Strann sat their horses on the hill to the south. Before
them, on the nearest rise of ground, a clump of tall trees and the
sharp triangle of a roof split the sky, while down towards the
right spread a wide huddle of sheds and barns.</p>

<p>"That's where the trail ends," said Mac Strann, and started his
horse down the slope. Haw-Haw Langley urged his little mount
hurriedly alongside the squat bulk of his companion. He looked like
the skeleton reality, and Mac Strann the blunt, deformed
shadow.</p>

<p>"You ain't going into the house lookin' for him, Mac?" he asked,
and he lowered his voice to a sharp whisper in spite of the
distance. "Maybe there's a pile of men in that house. It's got room
for a whole army. You ain't going in there by yourself, Mac?"</p>

<p>"Haw-Haw," explained the big man quietly, "I ain't going after
Barry. I'm going to make him come after me."</p>

<p>Haw-Haw considered this explanation for a dazed moment. It was
far too mysterious for his comprehension.</p>

<p>"What you goin' to do?" he asked again.</p>

<p>"Would you know that black hoss agin if you seen him?" asked Mac
Strann.</p>

<p>"In a thousand."</p>

<p>"That hoss has had a long ride; and Barry has put him in one of
them barns, they ain't no doubt. Most like, the dog is with the
hoss."</p>

<p>"It looks a considerable lot like a wolf," muttered Langley. "I
wouldn't choose meetin' up with that dog in the dark. Besides, what
good is it goin' to do you to find the dog?"</p>

<p>"If you hurt a man's dog," explained Mac Strann calmly, "you're
hurting the man, ain't you? I'm going to hurt this man's dog;
afterwards the dog'll bring the man to me. They ain't no doubt of
that. I ain't goin' to kill the dog. I'm goin' to jest nick him
so's he'll get well and then hit my trail."</p>

<p>"What sense is they in that?"</p>

<p>"If Barry comes to me, ain't he the one that's breakin' the law?
If I kill him then, won't it be in self-defense? I ain't no
law-breaker, Haw-Haw. It ain't any good bein' a law-breaker. Them
lawyers can talk a man right into a grave. They's worse nor poison.
I'd rather be caught in a bear trap a hundred miles from my shack
than have a lawyer fasten onto my leg right in the middle of
Brownsville. No, Haw-Haw, I ain't going to break any law. But I'm
going to fix the wolf so's he'll know me; and when he gets well
he'll hit my trail, and when he hits my trail he'll have Barry with
him. And when Barry sees me, then&mdash;" he raised his arms above
him in the dark. "Then!" breathed Mac Strann, "Jerry can start
sleepin' sound for the first time!"</p>

<p>Haw-Haw Langley wrapped his long arms about himself.</p>

<p>"An' I'll be there to watch. I'll be there to see fair play,
don't you never doubt it, Mac. Why didn't I never go with you
before? Why, Jerry never done anything to touch this! But be
careful, Mac. Don't make no slip up to-night. If they's
trouble&mdash;I ain't a fighting man, Mac. I ain't no ways built
for it."</p>

<p>"Shut your mouth," said Mac Strann bluntly. "I need quiet
now."</p>

<p>For they were now close to the house. Mac Strann brought his
horse to a jog trot and cast a semi-circle skirting the house and
bringing him behind the barns. Here he retreated to a little
jutting point of land from behind which the house was invisible,
and there dismounted.</p>

<p>Haw-Haw Langley followed example reluctantly. He complained: "I
ain't never heard before of a man leavin' his hoss behind him! It
ain't right and it ain't policy."</p>

<p>His leader, however, paid no attention to this grumbling. He
skirted back behind the barns, walking with a speed which extended
even the long legs of Haw-Haw Langley. Most of the stock was turned
out in the corrals. Now and then a horse stamped, or a bull snorted
from the fenced enclosures, but from the barns they heard not a
sound. Now Mac Strann paused. They had reached the largest of the
barns, a long, low structure.</p>

<p>"This here," said Mac Strann, "is where that hoss must be. They
wouldn't run a hoss like that with others. They'd keep him in a big
stall by himself. We'll try this one, Haw-Haw."</p>

<p>But Haw-Haw drew back at the door. The interior was black as the
hollow of a throat as soon as Mac Strann rolled back the sliding
door, and Haw-Haw imagined evil eyes glaring and twinkling at him
along the edges of the darkness.</p>

<p>"The wolf!" he cautioned, grasping the shoulder of his
companion. "You ain't goin' to walk onto that wolf, Mac?"</p>

<p>The latter struck down Haw-Haw's hand.</p>

<p>"A wolf makes a noise before it jumps," he whispered, "and that
warnin' is all the light I need."</p>

<p>Now their eyes grew somewhat accustomed to the dark and Haw-Haw
could make out, vaguely, the posts of the stalls to his right. He
could not tell whether or not some animal might be lying down
between the posts, but Mac Strann, pausing at every stall, seemed
to satisfy himself at a glance. Right down the length of the barn
they passed until they reached a wall at the farther end.</p>

<p>"He ain't here," sighed Haw-Haw, with relief. "Mac, if I was
you, I'd wait till they was light before I went huntin' that
wolf."</p>

<p>"He ought to be here," growled Mac Strann, and lighted a match.
The flame spurted in a blinding flash from the head of the match
and then settled down into a steady yellow glow. By that brief glow
Mac Strann looked up and down the wall. The match burned out
against the calloused tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>"That wall," mused Strann, "ain't made out of the same timber as
the side of the barn. That wall is whole years newer. Haw-Haw, that
<i>ain't</i> the end of the barn. They's a holler space beyond it."
He lighted another match, and then cursed softly in delight.
"Look!" he commanded.</p>

<p>At the farther side of the wall was the glitter of
metal&mdash;the latch of a door opening in the wooden wall. Mac
Strann set it ajar and Haw-Haw peered in over the big man's
shoulder. He saw first a vague and formless glimmer. Then he made
out a black horse lying down in the centre of a box stall. The
animal plunged at once to its feet, and crowding as far as possible
away against the wall, turned its head and stared at them with
flashing eyes.</p>

<p>"It's him!" whispered Haw-Haw. "It's Barry's black. They ain't
another hoss like him on the range. An' the wolf&mdash;thank
God!&mdash;ain't with him."</p>

<p>But Mac Strann closed the door of the stall, frowning
thoughtfully, and thought on the face of Strann was a convulsion of
pain. He dropped the second match to his feet, where it ignited a
wisp of straw that sent up a puff of light.</p>

<p>"Ah-h!" drawled Mac Strann. "The wolf ain't here, but we'll soon
have him here. And the thing that brings him here will get rid of
the black hoss."</p>

<p>"Are you goin' to steal the hoss?"</p>

<p>"Steal him? He couldn't carry me two mile, a skinny hoss like
that. But if Barry ever gets away agin on that hoss I ain't never
goin' to catch him. That hoss has got to die."</p>

<p>Haw-Haw Langley caught his breath with a harsh gurgle. For men
of the mountain-desert sometimes fall very low indeed, but in their
lowest moments it is easier for him to kill a man than a horse.
There is the story, for instance, of the cattleman who saw the
bull-fight in Juarez, and when the bull gored the first horse the
cowpuncher rose in the crowd and sent a bullet through the picador
to square the deal. So Haw-Haw sighed.</p>

<p>"Mac," he whispered, "has it got to be done? Ain't there any
other way? I've seen that hoss. When the sun hits him it sets him
on fire, he's that sleek. And his legs is like drawn-iron, they're
that fine. And he's got a head that's finer than a man's head,
Mac."</p>

<p>"I've seen him close enough," answered Mac Strann grimly. "An'
I've follered him for a day and a half, damn near. S'pose Barry
finds out I'm on his trail; s'pose he won't foller the wolf when
the wolf tries to lead him to me. S'pose he gets on this hoss and
cuts away? Can I foller the wind, Haw-Haw? This hoss has got to
die!"</p>

<p>From the manger he threw out several armfuls of hay, wrenched
down from behind the manger several light boards, and tossed them
on the hay. He lighted a match and was approaching the small flame
to the pile of inflammables when Haw-Haw Langley cried softly:
"Hark, Mac!"</p>

<p>The big man instantly extinguished the match. For a moment they
could distinguish nothing, but then they heard the sharp, high
chorus of the wild geese flying north. Haw-Haw Langley snickered
apologetically.</p>

<p>"That was what I heard a minute ago!" he said. "And it sounded
like voices comin'."</p>

<p>A snarl of contempt came from Mac Strann; then he scratched
another match and at once the flame licked up the side of the hay
and cast a long arm up the wooden wall.</p>

<p>"Out of this, quick!" commanded Mac Strann, and they started
hastily down the barn towards the door. The fire behind them, after
the puff of flame from the hay, had died away to a ghastly and
irregular glow with the crackle of the slowly catching wood. It
gave small light to guide them&mdash;only enough, indeed, to
deceive the eye. The posts of the stalls grew into vast, shadowy
images; the irregularities of the floor became high places and pits
alternately. But when they were halfway to the door, Haw-Haw
Langley saw a form too grim to be a shadow, blocking their path. It
was merely a blacker shape among the shades, but Haw-Haw was aware
of the two shining eyes, and stopped short in his tracks.</p>

<p>"The wolf!" he whispered to Mac Strann. "Mac, what're we goin'
to do?"</p>

<p>The other had not time to answer, for the shadow at the door of
the barn now leaped towards them, silently, without growl or yelp
or snarl. As if to guide the battle, the kindling wood behind them
now ignited and sent up a yellow burst of light. By it Haw-Haw
Langley saw the great beast clearly, and he leaped back behind the
sheltering form of Mac Strann. As for Mac, he did not move or
flinch from the attack. His revolver was in his hand, levelled, and
following the swift course of Black Bart.</p>

<h2><a id="chap22" name="chap22">22. PATIENCE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">There is one patience greater than the endurance
of the cat at the hole of the mouse or the wolf which waits for the
moose to drop, and that is the patience of the thinking man; the
measure of the Hindoo's moveless contemplation of Nirvana is not in
hours but in weeks or even in months. Randall Byrne sat at his
sentinel post with his hands folded and his grave eyes steadily
fixed before him, and for hour after hour he did not move. Though
the wind rose, now and again, and whistled through the upper
chambers or mourned down the empty halls, Randall Byrne did not
stir so much as an eyelash in observance. Two things held him
fascinated. One was the girl who had passed up yonder stairs so
wearily without a single backward glance at him; the other was the
silent battle which went on in the adjoining room. Now and then his
imagination wandered away to secondary pictures. He would see Barry
meeting Buck Daniels, at last, and striking him down as
remorselessly as the hound strikes the hare; or he would see him
riding back towards Elkhead and catch a bright, sad vision of Kate
Cumberland waving a careless adieu to him, and then hear her
singing carelessly as she turned away. Such pictures as these,
however, came up but rarely in the mind of Byrne. Mostly he thought
of the stranger leaning over the body of old Joe Cumberland,
reviving him, restoring him with electric energy, paying back, as
it were, some ancient debt. And he thought of the girl as she had
turned at the landing place of the stairs, her head fallen; and he
thought of her lying in her bed, with her arm under the mass of
bright hair, trying to sleep, very tired, but remorsely held awake
by that same power which was bringing Joe Cumberland back from the
verge of death.</p>

<p>It was all impossible. This thing could not be. It was really as
bad as the yarn of the Frankenstein monster. He considered how it
would seem in print, backed by his most solemn asseverations, and
then he saw the faces of the men who associated with him, pale
thoughtful faces striving to conceal their smiles and their
contempt. But always he came back, like the desperate hare doubling
on his course, upon the picture of Kate Cumberland there at the
turning of the stairs, and that bent, bright head which confessed
defeat. The man had forgotten her. It made Byrne open his eyes in
incredulity even to imagine such a thing. The man had forgotten
her! She was no more to him than some withered hag he might ride
past on the road.</p>

<p>His ear, subconsciously attentive to everything around him,
caught a faint sound from the next room. It was a regular noise. It
had the rhythm of a quick footfall, but in its nature it was more
like the sound of a heavily beating pulse. Randall Byrne sat up in
his chair. A faint creaking attested that it was, indeed, a
footfall traversing the room to and fro, steadily.</p>

<p>The stranger, then, no longer leaned over the couch of the old
cattleman. He was walking up and down the floor with that
characteristic, softly padding step. Of what did he think as he
walked? It carried Byrne automatically out into the darkest night,
with a wind in his face, and the rhythm of a long striding horse
carrying him on to a destination unknown.</p>

<p>Here he heard a soft scratching, repeated, at the door. When it
came again he rose and opened the door&mdash;at once the tall,
shaggy dog slipped through the opening and glided past him. It
startled Byrne oddly to see the animal stealing away, as if Barry
himself had been leaving. He called to the beast, but he was met by
a silent baring of white fangs that stopped him in his tracks. The
great dog was gone without a sound, and Byrne closed the door again
without casting a look inside. He was stupidly, foolishly afraid to
look within.</p>

<p>After that the silence had a more vital meaning. No pictures
crowded his brain. He was simply keyed to a high point of
expectancy, and therefore, when the door was opened silently, he
sprang up as if in acknowledgment of an alarm and faced Barry. The
latter closed the door behind him and glided after the big dog. He
had almost crossed the big room when Byrne was able to speak.</p>

<p>"Mr. Barry!" he called.</p>

<p>The man hesitated.</p>

<p>"Mr. Barry," he repeated.</p>

<p>And Dan Barry turned. It was something like the act of the wolf
the moment before&mdash;a swift movement, a flash of the eyes in
something like defiance.</p>

<p>"Mr. Barry, are you leaving us?"</p>

<p>"I'm going outside."</p>

<p>"Are you coming back?"</p>

<p>"I dunno."</p>

<p>A great joy swelled in the throat of Doctor Byrne. He felt like
shouting in triumph; yet he remembered once more how the girl had
gone up the stairs, wearily, with fallen head. He decided that he
would do what he could to keep the stranger with them, and though
Randall Byrne lived to be a hundred he would never do a finer thing
than what he attempted then. He stepped across the room and stood
before Barry, blocking the way.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said gravely, "if you go now, you will work a great
sorrow in this house."</p>

<p>A glint of anger rose in the eyes of Barry.</p>

<p>"Joe Cumberland is sleepin' soun'," he answered. "He'll be a
pile rested when he wakes up. He don't need me no more."</p>

<p>"He's not the only one who needs you," said Byrne. "His daughter
has been waiting impatiently for your coming, sir."</p>

<p>The sharp glance of Barry wavered away.</p>

<p>"I'd kind of like to stay," he murmured, "but I got to go."</p>

<p>A dull voice called from the next room.</p>

<p>"It's Joe Cumberland," said Byrne. "You see, he is not
sleeping!"</p>

<p>The brow of Barry clouded, and he turned gloomily back.</p>

<p>"Maybe I better stay," he agreed.</p>

<p>Yet before he made a step Byrne heard a far-away honking of the
wild geese, that musical discord carrying for uncounted miles
through the windy air. The sound worked like magic on Barry. He
whirled back.</p>

<p>"I got to go," he repeated.</p>

<p>And yet Byrne blocked the way. It required more courage to do
that than to do anything he had ever attempted in his life. The
sweat poured out from under his armpits as the stranger stepped
near; the blood rushed from his face as he stared into the eyes of
Barry&mdash;eyes which now held an uncanny glimmer of yellow
light.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Byrne huskily, "you must not go! Listen! Old
Cumberland is calling to you again! Does that mean nothing? If you
have some errand out in the night, let me go for you."</p>

<p>"Partner," said the soft voice of Barry, "stand aside. I got no
time, I'm wanted!"</p>

<p>Every muscle of Randall Byrne's body was set to repulse the
stranger in any effort to pass through that door, and yet,
mysteriously, against his will, he found himself standing to one
side, and saw the other slip through the open door.</p>

<p>"Dan! Are ye there?" called a louder voice from the room
beyond.</p>

<p>There was no help for it. He, himself, must go back and face Joe
Cumberland. With a lie, no doubt. He would say that Dan had stepped
out for a moment and would be back again. That might put Cumberland
safely to sleep. In the morning, to be sure, he would find out the
deception&mdash;but let every day bury its dead. Here was enough
trouble for one night. He went slowly, but steadily enough, towards
the door of what had now become a fatal room to the doctor. In that
room he had seen his dearest doctrines cremated. Out of that room
he had come bearing the ashes of his hopes in his hands. Now he
must go back once more to try to fill, with science, a gap of which
science could never take cognizance.</p>

<p>He lingered another instant with his hand on the door; then he
cast it wide bravely enough and stepped in. Joe Cumberland was
sitting up on the edge of his couch. There was colour in the old
man's face. It almost seemed, to the incredulous eyes of Byrne,
that the face was filled out a trifle. Certainly the fire of the
old cattleman's glance was less unearthly.</p>

<p>"Where's Dan?" he called. "Where'd he go?"</p>

<p>It was no longer the deep, controlled voice of the stoic; it was
the almost whining complaint of vital weakness.</p>

<p>"Is there anything I can do for you?" parried Byrne. "Anything
you need or wish?"</p>

<p>"Him!" answered the old man explosively. "Damn it, I need Dan!
Where is he? He was here. I <i>felt</i> him here while I was
sleepin'. <i>Where is he</i>?"</p>

<p>"He has stepped out for an instant," answered Byrne smoothly.
"He will be back shortly."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;has&mdash;stepped&mdash;out?" echoed the old man
slowly. Then he rose to the full of his gaunt height. His white
hair, his triangle of beard and pointed moustache gave him a
detached, a mediaeval significance; a portrait by Van Dyck had
stepped from its frame.</p>

<p>"Doc, you're lyin' to me! Where has he gone?"</p>

<p>A sudden, almost hysterical burst of emotion swept Doctor
Byrne.</p>

<p>"Gone to heaven or hell!" he cried with startling violence.
"Gone to follow the wind and the wild geese&mdash;God knows
where!"</p>

<p>Like a period to his sentence, a gun barked outside, there was a
howl of demoniac pain and rage, and then a scream that would tingle
in the ear of Doctor Randall Byrne till his dying day.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap23" name="chap23">23. HOW MAC STRANN KEPT THE
LAW</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">For when the dog sprang, Mac Strann fired, and the
wolf was jerked up in the midst of his leap by the tearing impact
of the bullet. It was easy for Strann to dodge the beast, and the
great black body hurtled past him and struck heavily on the floor
of the barn. It missed Mac Strann, indeed, but it fell at the very
feet of Haw-Haw Langley, and a splash of blood flirted across his
face. He was too terrified to shriek, but fell back against the
wall of the barn, gasping. There he saw Black Bart struggle to
regain his feet, vainly, for both of the animal's forelegs seemed
paralyzed. Now the yellow light of the fire rose brightly, and by
it Haw-Haw marked the terrible eyes and the lolling, slavering
tongue of the great beast, and the fangs like ivory daggers. It
could not regain its feet, but it thrust itself forward by
convulsive efforts of the hind legs towards Mac Strann.</p>

<p>Haw-Haw Langley stared for a single instant in white-faced fear,
but when he realised that Black Bart was helpless as a toothless
old dog, the tall cowpuncher twisted his lean fingers with a silent
joy. Once more Bart pushed himself towards Mac Strann, and then
Haw-Haw Langley stepped forward, and with all the force of his long
leg smashed his heavy riding boot into the face of the dog. Black
Bart toppled back against the base of the manger, struggled vainly
to regain his poise, and it was then that he pointed his nose up,
and wailed like a lost soul, wailed with the fury of impotent hate.
Mac Strann caught Haw-Haw by the arm and dragged him back towards
the door.</p>

<p>"I don't want to <i>kill</i> the dog," he repeated. "Get out of
here, Haw-Haw. Barry'll be comin' any minute."</p>

<p>He could have used no sharper spur to urge on the laggard.
Haw-Haw Langley raced out of the barn a full stride before Mac
Strann. They hurried together to the little rise of ground behind
which they had left their horses, and as they ran the scream which
had curdled the blood of Randall Byrne rang through the night. In a
thousand years he could never have guessed from what that yell
issued; his nearest surmise would have been a score of men
screaming in unison under the torture. But Mac Strann and Haw-Haw
Langley knew the sound well enough.</p>

<p>When they mounted their saddles they could look over the top of
the little hill and observe everything easily without being seen,
for the hill-top commanded a range of the corrals and a view of the
fronts of the barns and sheds which opened upon the fenced
enclosures. The largest and longest of these buildings was now
plainly visible, for a long arm of fire reached above the roof on
one side of the low shed and by this growing light the other barns,
the glimmering-eyed horses and cattle of the corrals, the trees
about the house, the house itself, were in turn visible, though
vaguely, and at times, as the flame lapsed, all were lost in a
flood of swift darkness. Once more that unhuman shriek echoed from
hill to hill and from building to building. It was Satan in his box
stall. The flames were eating through the partition, and the
stallion was mad with fear.</p>

<p>Lights flashed, here and there, in the big ranch house; and from
the bunk-house on the farther side of the corrals rose a volley of
curses and yells of dismay. The cattle began milling blindly,
bellowing and stamping, and the horses ranged at a mad gallop back
and forth across their corrals, wild-eyed with terror. It was like
the tumult of a battle, and sharper than a trumpet a new sound cut
through the din&mdash;it was a short, high whistle, twice repeated.
An answer came from the burning barn&mdash;the long, strong
neighing of the stallion.</p>

<p>"D'ye hear?" muttered Mac Strann. "It's the hoss talkin' to his
master!"</p>

<p>"And there he comes!" said Haw-Haw Langley. "Runnin' like the
wind!"</p>

<p>The flame, picked up by the gale, tore for itself a wider
breathing space through the roof and sent up an audibly roaring
column of blinding red. By that light, Mac Strann, following
Haw-Haw's directing arm, saw a lithe figure vault over the fence on
the farther side of the corral and dart forward among the milling
cattle.</p>

<p>Now, when cattle begin to mill it takes a brave man on a brave,
well-trained horse to trust his chances in the midst of that ocean
of tossing horns. But this man ventured it on foot. Mac Strann
could follow him easily, for the man's hat was off, and the
firelight glittered on his black hair. That glimmering head darted
here and there among the circling cattle. Now it was lost, swamped,
to all appearances, under a score of trampling hooves. Again it
reappeared on the further side. Mac Strann could see the runner in
a comparatively open space, racing like a trained sprinter, and he
headed straight towards a wall of tossing horns. They were
long-horns, and one sway of those lowered heads could drive the
hard, sharp point through and through the body of a man. Yet
straight at this impassable wall the stranger rushed, like a
warrior in his Berserker madness leaping naked upon a hedge of
spears. At the verge of the danger the man sprang high into the
air. Two leaps, from back to back among the herd, and he was across
the thicket of danger, down once more on the ground, and dodging
past the outskirts of the bellowing cows. Over the nearer fence he
vaulted and disappeared into the smoke which vomited from the mouth
of the burning barn.</p>

<p>"God A'mighty," groaned Haw-Haw Langley, "can he get the hoss
out?"</p>

<p>"It ain't possible," answered Mac Strann. "All hosses goes mad
when they gets in a fire&mdash;even when they sees a fire. Look at
them fools over yonder in the corral."</p>

<p>Indeed, in the horse-corral a score of frantic animals were
attempting to leap the high rails in the direction of the burning
barn. Their stamping and snorting came volleying up the hill to the
watchers.</p>

<p>"All hosses goes mad," concluded Mac Strann, "an' Barry'll get
tramped under the feet of his own hoss even if he gets to the
stall&mdash;which he won't. Look there!"</p>

<p>Out of the rush of fire and smoke at the door of the barn Dan
Barry stumbled, blindly, and fell back upon the ground. Haw-Haw
Langley began to twist his cold hands together in an ecstasy.</p>

<p>"The hoss is gone and the wolf is gone, and Barry is beat!" he
chuckled to himself. "Mac, I wouldn't of missed this for a ten
days' ride. It's worth it. But see the gal and that new gent,
Mac!"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>For when the clamour arose outside the house, Buck Daniels had
run to the window. For many reasons he had not taken off his
clothes this night, but had lain down on the bed and folded his
hands behind his head to wait. With the first outcry he was at the
window and there he saw the flames curling above the roof of the
barn, and next, by that wild light, how Dan Barry raced through the
dangerous corral, and then he heard the shrill neighing of Satan,
and saw Dan disappear in the smoking door of the barn.</p>

<p>Fear drew Buck Daniels one way but a fine impulse drew him
another. He turned away from the window with a curse; he turned
back to it with a curse, and then, muttering: "He went through hell
for me; and him and me together, we'll go through hell again!" he
ran from the room and thundered down the crazy stairs.</p>

<p>As he left the house he found Kate Cumberland, and they went on
together, running without a word to each other. Only, when he came
beside her, she stopped short and flashed one glance at him. By
that glance he knew that she understood why he was there, and that
she accepted his sacrifice.</p>

<p>They hurried around the outer edge of the corrals, and as they
approached the flaming barn from one side the men from the
bunk-house rushed up from the other. It was Buck Daniels who
reached Dan as the latter stumbled back from the door of the barn,
surrounded by a following cloud of smoke, and fell stumbling to the
ground. And Buck raised him.</p>

<p>The girl was instantly beside them.</p>

<p>She had thrown on a white dressing gown when she rose from bed.
It was girded high across her breast, and over it showered her
bright hair, flashing like liquid gold in growing light. She, now,
received the semi-conscious burden of Dan Barry, and Buck Daniels
stepped forward, close to the smoke. He began to shout directions
which the two watchers behind the hill could not hear, though they
saw his long arms point and gesticulate and they could see his
speaking lips. But wild confusion was on the crowd of cowpunchers.
They ran here and there. One or two brought buckets of water and
tossed the contents uselessly into the swirling, red-stained hell
of smoke. But most of them ran here and there, accomplishing
nothing.</p>

<p>"An' all this come from one little match, Mac," cried Haw-Haw
ecstatically at the ear of Mac Strann. "All what we're seein'! Look
at the gal, Mac! She's out of her wits! She's foolin' about Barry,
doin' no good."</p>

<p>A gust of smoke and fire must have met Barry face to face when
he entered the barn, for he seemed now as helpless as if he were
under a strong narcotic influence. He leaned heavily back into the
arms of the girl, his head rolling wildly from side to side. Then,
clearer than before, dominating all the confusion of noise, and
with a ringing, trumpet note of courage in it, the black stallion
neighed again from his burning stall. It had a magic effect upon
Barry. He stood up and tore himself from the arms of the girl. They
saw her gesture and cry to the surrounding men for help, and a
dozen hands were stretched out to keep the madman from running
again into the fire. They might better have attempted to hold a
wild horse with their naked hands. He slipped and broke through
their grips, and a second later had leaped into the inferno of
smoke, running bent close to the ground where the pure air, if
there were any, was sure to be.</p>

<p>"The gal's sick!" said Haw-Haw Langley. "Look, Mac!"</p>

<p>And he began to laugh in that braying voice which had given him
his nickname. Yet even in his laughter his eyes were brightly
observant; not a single detail of misery or grief was lost upon
him; he drank it in; he fed his famine-stricken soul upon it. Kate
Cumberland had buried her face in her arms; Buck Daniels,
attempting to rush in after Dan Barry, had been caught beneath the
arms by Doctor Byrne and another and was now borne struggling
back.</p>

<p>From the very heart of the burning barn the sharp single whistle
burst and over the rolling smoke and spring fire rose the answering
neigh. A human voice could not have spoken more intelligibly: "I
wait in trust!"</p>

<p>After that neigh and whistle, a quiet fell over the group at the
barn door. There was nothing to do. There was not enough wind to
blow the flames from this barn to one of the neighbouring sheds;
all they could do was to stand still and watch the progress of the
conflagration.</p>

<p>The deep, thick voice of Mac Strann broke in: "Start prayin',
Haw-Haw, that the hoss don't kill Barry when he gets to him. Start
prayin' that Barry is left for me to finish."</p>

<p>He must have meant his singular request more as a figure of
speech than a real demand, but an hysteria was upon Haw-Haw
Langley. He stretched up his vast, gaunt arms to the dim spot of
red in the central heavens above the fire, and Haw-Haw prayed for
the first and last time in his life.</p>

<p>"O Lord, gimme this one favour. Bring Barry safe out of the
barn. Bring him out even if you got to bring the damned hoss with
him. Bring him out and save him for Mac Strann to meet. And, God
A'mighty, let me be around somewhere's when they meet!"</p>

<p>This strange exhibition Mac Strann watched with a glowering
eye.</p>

<p>"But it ain't possible," he said positively. "I been in fires.
Barry can't live through the fire; an' if he does, the hoss will
finish him. It ain't possible for him to come out!"</p>

<p>From half the roof of the shed flames now poured, but presently
a great shower of sparks rose at the farther end of the barn, and
then Haw-Haw heard the sound of a beating and crashing.</p>

<p>"Hey!" he screamed, "Barry's reached the black hoss and the
black hoss is beating him into the floor!"</p>

<p>"You fool!" answered Mac Strann calmly, "Barry has got a beam or
something and he's smashing down the burning partition of the box
stall. That's what he's doing; listen!"</p>

<p>High over the fire, once again rose the neighing of the black
horse, a sound of unspeakable triumph.</p>

<p>"You're right," groaned Haw-Haw, downcast. "He's reached the
hoss!"</p>

<p>He had hardly finished speaking when Mac Strann said: "Anyway,
he'll never get out. This end wall of the barn is fallin' in."</p>

<p>Indeed, the outer wall of the barn, nearest the door, was
wavering in a great section and slowly tottering in. Another moment
or two it would crash to the floor and block the way of Dan Barry,
coming out, with a flaming ruin. Next the watchers saw a struggle
among the group which watched. Three men were struggling with Buck
Daniels, but presently he wrenched his arms free, struck down two
men before him with swinging blows of his fists, and leaped into
the smoke.</p>

<p>"He's gone nutty, like a crazy hoss with the sight of the fire,"
said Mac Strann quietly.</p>

<p>"He ain't! He ain't!" cried Haw-Haw Langley, wild with
excitement. "He's holdin' back the burnin' wall to keep the way
clear, damn him!"</p>

<p>Indeed, the tottering wall, not having leaned to a great angle,
was now pushed back by some power from the inside of the barn and
kept erect. Though now and again it swayed in, as though the
strength which held it was faltering under the strain.</p>

<p>Now the eyes of the watchers were called to the other end of the
barn by a tremendous crashing. The entire section of that part of
the roof fell in, and a shower of sparks leaped up into the heart
of the sky, lighting the distant hills and drawing them near like
watchers of the horror of the night.</p>

<p>"That's the end," said Mac Strann. "Haw-Haw, they wasn't any
good in your prayer."</p>

<p>"I ain't a professional prayin' man," answered Haw-Haw
defensively, "but I done my best. If&mdash;" He was cut short by a
chorused cry from the watchers near the door of the barn, and then,
through the vomited smoke and the fire, leaped the unsaddled body
of Satan bearing on his back the crouched figure of Dan Barry, and
in the arms of Barry, limp, his head hanging down loosely, was the
body of the great black dog, Bart.</p>

<p>A fearful picture. The smoke swept following around the black
stallion, and a great tongue of flame licked hungrily after the
trio. But the stallion stood with head erect, and ears flattened,
pawing the ground. With that cloud of destruction blowing him he
stood like the charger which the last survivor might ride through
the ruin of the universe in the Twilight of the Gods.</p>

<p>At the same instant, another smoke-clad figure lunged from the
door of the barn, his hands outstretched as though he felt and
fumbled his way through utter darkness. It was Buck Daniels, and as
he cleared the door the section of tottering wall which he had
upheld to keep the way clear for the Three, wavered, sagged, and
then sank in thunder to the floor, and the whole barn lay a
flame-tossed mass of ruin.</p>

<p>The watchers had scattered before the plunge of Satan, but he
came to a sliding halt, as if his rider had borne heavily back upon
the reins. Barry slipped from the stallion's back with the wounded
dog, and kneeled above the limp figure.</p>

<p>"It ain't the end," growled Mac Strann, "that hoss will go
runnin' back into the fire. It ain't hoss nature to keep from goin'
mad at the sight of a fire!"</p>

<p>In answer to him, the black stallion whirled, raised his head
high, and, with flaunting mane and tail, neighed a ringing defiance
at the rising flames. Then he turned back and nuzzled the shoulder
of his master, who was working with swift hands over the body of
Black Bart.</p>

<p>"Anyway," snarled Haw-Haw Langley, "the damned wolf is
dead."</p>

<p>"I dunno," said Mac Strann. "Maybe&mdash;maybe not. They's quite
a pile that we dunno."</p>

<p>"If you want to get rid of the hoss," urged Haw-Haw, writhing in
the glee of a new inspiration, "now's the time for it, Mac. Get out
your gun and pot the black. Before the crowd can get after us,
we'll be miles away. They ain't a saddled hoss in sight. Well, if
you don't want to do it, I will!" And he whipped out his gun.</p>

<p>But Mac Strann reached across and dragged the muzzle down.</p>

<p>"We done all we're goin' to do to-night. Seems like God's been
listenin' pretty close, around here!"</p>

<p>He turned his horse, and Haw-Haw, reluctantly, followed suit.
Still, as they trotted slowly away from the burning barn, Haw-Haw
kept his glance fixed behind him until a final roaring crash and a
bellying cloud of fire that smote the zenith announced the end of
the barn. Then Haw-Haw turned his face to his companion.</p>

<p>"Now what?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"We go to Elkhead and sit down and wait," answered Mac Strann.
"If the dog gets well he'll bring Barry to us. Then all I've got to
do is defend myself."</p>

<p>Haw-Haw Langley twisted up his face and laughed, silently, to
the red-stained sky.</p>

<h2><a id="chap24" name="chap24">24. DOCTOR BYRNE LOOKS INTO THE
PAST</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The black head of Barry, the brown head of Randall
Byrne, the golden head of Kate Cumberland, were all bowed around
the limp body of Black Bart. Buck Daniels, still gasping for
breath, stood reeling nearby.</p>

<p>"Let me attempt to resuscitate the animal," offered the
doctor.</p>

<p>He was met by a blank look from Barry. The hair of the man was
scorched, his skin was blistered and burned. Only his hands
remained uninjured, and these continued to move over the body of
the great dog. Kate Cumberland was on her knees over the brute.</p>

<p>"Is it fatal, Dan?" she asked. "Is there no hope for Bart?"</p>

<p>There was no answer from Barry, and she attempted to raise the
fallen, lifeless head of the animal; but instantly a strong arm
darted out and brushed her hands away. Those hands fell idly at her
sides and her head went back as though she had been struck across
the face. She found herself looking up into the angry eyes of
Randall Byrne. He reached down and raised her to her feet; there
was no colour in her face, no life in her limbs.</p>

<p>"There's nothing more to be done here, apparently," said the
doctor coldly. "Suppose we take your father and go back to the
house."</p>

<p>She made neither assent nor dissent. Dan Barry had finished a
swift, deft bandage and stopped the bleeding of the dog's wounds.
Now he raised his head and his glance slipped rapidly over the
faces of the doctor and the girl and rested on Buck Daniels. There
was no flash of kindly thanks, no word of recognition. His right
hand raised to his cheek, and rested there, and in his eyes came
that flare of yellow hate. Buck Daniels shrank back until he was
lost in the crowd. Then he turned and stumbled back towards the
house.</p>

<p>Instantly, Barry began to work at expanding and depressing the
lungs of the huge animal as he might have worked to bring a man
back to life.</p>

<p>"Watch him!" whispered the doctor to Kate Cumberland. "He is
closer to that dog&mdash;that wolf, it looks like&mdash;than he has
ever been to any human being!"</p>

<p>She would not answer, but she turned her head quickly away from
the man and his beast.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid to watch?" challenged Byrne, for his anger at
Barry's blunt refusals still made his blood hot. "When your father
lay at death's door was he half so anxious as he is now? Did he
work so hard, by half? See how his eyes are fixed on the muzzle of
the beast as if he were studying a human face!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" breathed the girl.</p>

<p>"I tell you, look!" commanded the doctor. "For there's the
solution of the mystery. No mystery at all. Barry is simply a man
who is closer akin to the brute forces in nature. See! By the
eternal heavens, he's dragging that beast&mdash;that dumb
beast&mdash;back from the door of death!"</p>

<p>Barry had ceased his rapid manipulations, and turned the big dog
back upon its side. Now the eyes of Black Bart opened, and winked
shut again. Now the master kneeled at the head of the beast and
took the scarred, shaggy head between his hands.</p>

<p>"Bart!" he commanded.</p>

<p>Not a stir in the long, black body. The stallion edged a pace
closer, dropped his velvet muzzle, and whinnied softly at the very
ear of the dog. Still, there was not an answering quiver.</p>

<p>"Bart!" called the man again, and there was a ring of wild
grief&mdash;of fear&mdash;in his cry.</p>

<p>"Do you hear?" said Byrne savagely, at the ear of the girl. "Did
you ever use such a tone with a human being? Ever?"</p>

<p>"Take me away!" she murmured. "I'm sick&mdash;sick at heart.
Take me away!"</p>

<p>Indeed, she was scarcely sure of her poise, and tottered where
she stood. Doctor Byrne slipped his arm about her and led her away,
supporting half her weight. They went slowly, by small, soft steps,
towards the house, and before they reached it, he knew that she was
weeping. But if there was sadness in Byrne, there was also a great
joy. He was afire, for there is a flamelike quality in hope. Loss
of blood and the stifling smoke, rather than a mortal injury or the
touch of fire, had brought Black Bart close to death, but now that
his breathing was restored, and almost normal, he gained rapidly.
One instant he lingered on the border between life and death; the
next, the brute's eyes opened and glittered with dim recognition up
towards Dan, and he licked the hand which supported his head. At
Dan's direction, a blanket was brought, and after Dan had lifted
Black Bart upon it, four men raised the corners of the blanket and
carried the burden towards the house. One of the cowpunchers went
ahead bearing the light. This was the sight which Doctor Byrne and
Kate Cumberland saw from the veranda of the ranch-house as they
turned and looked back before going in.</p>

<p>"A funeral procession," suggested the doctor.</p>

<p>"No," she answered positively. "If Black Bart were dead, Dan
wouldn't allow any hands save his own to touch the body. No, Black
Bart is alive! Yet, it's impossible."</p>

<p>The word "impossible," however, was gradually dropping from the
vocabulary of Randall Byrne. True, the wolf-dog had seemed dead
past recovery and across the eyes of Byrne came a vision of the
dead rising from their graves. Yet he merely shook his head and
said nothing.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she broke in. "Look!"</p>

<p>The procession drew nearer, heading towards the back of the big
house, and now they saw that Dan Barry walked beside the body of
Black Bart, a smile on his lifted face. They disappeared behind the
back of the house.</p>

<p>Byrne heard the girl murmuring, more to herself than to him:
"Once he was like that all the time."</p>

<p>"Like what?" he asked bluntly.</p>

<p>She paused, and then her hand dropped lightly on his arm. He
could not see more than a vague outline of her in the night, only
the dull glimmer of her face as she turned her head, and the faint
whiteness of her hand.</p>

<p>"Let's say good-night," she answered, at length. "Our little
worlds have toppled about our heads to-night&mdash;all your
theories, it seems, and, God knows, all that I have hoped. Why
should we stay here and make ourselves miserable by talk?"</p>

<p>"But because we have failed," he said steadily, "is that a
reason we should creep off and brood over our failure in silence?
No, let's talk it out, man to man."</p>

<p>"You have a fine courage," said the girl. "But what is there we
can say?"</p>

<p>He answered: "For my part, I am not so miserable as you think.
For I feel as if this night had driven us closer together, you see;
and I've caught a perspective on everything that has happened
here."</p>

<p>"Tell me what you know."</p>

<p>"Only what I think I know. It may be painful to hear."</p>

<p>"I'm very used to pain."</p>

<p>"Well, a moment ago, when Barry was walking beside his dog,
smiling, you murmured that he once was like that always. It gave me
light. So I'd say that there was a time when Dan Barry lived here
with you and your father. Am I right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for years and years."</p>

<p>"And in those times he was not greatly different from other men.
Not on the surface."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You came to be very fond of him."</p>

<p>"We were to marry," answered Kate Cumberland, and Byrne
winced.</p>

<p>He went on: "Then something happened&mdash;suddenly&mdash;that
took him away from you, and you did not see him again until
to-night. Am I right?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I thought you must have heard the story&mdash;from the
outside. I'll tell you the truth. My father found Dan Barry
wandering across the hills years ago. He was riding home over the
range and he heard a strange and beautiful whistling, and when he
looked up he saw on the western ridge, walking against the sky, a
tattered figure of a boy. He rode up and asked the boy his name. He
learned it was Dan Barry&mdash;Whistling Dan, he was called. But
the boy could not, or would not, tell how he came to be there in
the middle of the range without a horse. He merely said that he
came from 'over there,' and waved his hand to the south and east.
That was all. He didn't seem to be alarmed because he was alone,
and yet he apparently knew nothing of the country; he was lost in
this terrible country where a man could wander for days without
finding a house, and yet the boy was whistling as he walked! So Dad
took him home and sent out letters all about&mdash;to the railroad
in particular&mdash;to find out if such a boy was missing.</p>

<p>"He received no answer. In the meantime he gave Dan a room in
the house; and I remember how Dan sat at the table the first
night&mdash;I was a very little girl then&mdash;and how I laughed
at his strange way of eating. His knife was the only thing he was
interested in and he made it serve for knife, fork, and spoon, and
he held the meat in his fingers while he cut it. The next morning
he was missing. One of Dad's range riders picked up Dan several
miles to the north, walking along, whistling gayly. The next
morning he was missing again and was caught still farther away.
After that Dad had a terrible scene with him&mdash;I don't know
exactly what happened&mdash;but Dan promised to run away no more,
and ever since then Dad has been closer to Dan than anyone
else.</p>

<p>"So Dan grew up. From the time I could first distinctly
remember, he was very gentle and good-natured, but he was
different, always. After a while he got Black Bart, you know, and
then he went out with a halter and captured Satan. Think of
capturing a wild mustang with nothing but a halter! He played
around with them so much that I was jealous of them. So I kept with
them until Bart and Satan were rather used to me. Bart would even
play with me now and then when Dan wasn't near. And so finally Dan
and I were to be married.</p>

<p>"Dad didn't like the idea. He was afraid of what Dan might
become. And he was right. One day, in a saloon that used to stand
on that hill over there, Dan had a fight&mdash;his first
fight&mdash;with a man who had struck him across the mouth for no
good reason. That man was Jim Silent. Of course you've heard of
him?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"He was a famous long-rider&mdash;an outlaw with a very black
record. At the end of that fight he struck Dan down with a chair
and escaped. I went down to Dan when I heard of the
fight&mdash;Black Bart led me down, to be exact&mdash;but Dan would
not come back to the house, and he'd have no more to do with anyone
until he had found Jim Silent. I can't tell you everything that
happened. Finally he caught Jim Silent and killed him&mdash;with
his bare hands. Buck Daniels saw it. Then Dan came back to us, but
on the first night he began to grow restless. It was last
Fall&mdash;the wild geese were flying south&mdash;and while they
were honking in the sky Dan got up, said good-bye, and left us. We
have never seen him again until to-night. All we knew was that he
had ridden south&mdash;after the wild geese."</p>

<p>A long silence fell between them, for the doctor was thinking
hard.</p>

<p>"And when he came back," he said, "Barry did not know you? I
mean you were nothing to him?"</p>

<p>"You were there," said the girl, faintly.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly clear," said Byrne. "If it were a little more
commonplace it might be puzzling, but being so extraordinary it
clears itself up. Did you really expect the dog, the wolf-dog,
Black Bart, to remember you?"</p>

<p>"I may have expected it."</p>

<p>"But you were not surprised, of course!"</p>

<p>"Naturally not."</p>

<p>"Yet you see that Dan Barry&mdash;Whistling Dan, you call
him&mdash;was closer to Black Bart than he was to you?"</p>

<p>"Why should I see that?"</p>

<p>"You watched him a moment ago when he was leaning over the
dog."</p>

<p>He watched her draw her dressing gown closer about her, as
though the cold bit more keenly then.</p>

<p>She said simply: "Yes, I saw."</p>

<p>"Don't you see that he is simply more in tune with the animal
world? And it's really no more reasonable to expect Black Bart to
remember you than it is to expect Dan Barry to remember you? It's
quite plain. When you go back to the beginning man was simply an
animal, without the higher senses, as we call them. He was simply a
brute, living in trees or in caves. Afterwards he grew into the
thing we all know. But why not imagine a throw-back into the
earlier instincts? Why not imagine the creature devoid of the
impulses of mind, the thing which we call man, and see the splendid
animal? You saw in Dan Barry simply a biological sport&mdash;the
freak&mdash;the thing which retraces the biological progress and
comes close to the primitive. But of course you could not realise
this. He seemed a man, and you accepted him as a man. In reality he
was no more a man than Black Bart is a man. He had the face and
form of a man, but his instincts were as old as the ages. The
animal world obeys him. Satan neighs in answer to his whistle. The
wolf-dog licks his hand at the point of death. There is the
profound difference, always. You try to reconcile him with other
men; you give him the attributes of other men. Open your eyes; see
the truth: that he is no more akin to man than Black Bart is like a
man. And when you give him your affection, Miss Cumberland, <i>you
are giving your affection to a wild wolf</i>! Do you believe
me?"</p>

<p>He knew that she was shaken. He could feel it, even without the
testimony of his eyes to witness. He went on, speaking with great
rapidity, lest she should escape from the influence which he had
already gained over her.</p>

<p>"I felt it when I first saw him&mdash;a certain nameless kinship
with elemental forces. The wind blew through the open door&mdash;it
was Dan Barry. The wild geese called from the open sky&mdash;for
Dan Barry. These are the things which lead him. These the forces
which direct him. You have loved him; but is love merely a giving?
No, you have seen in him a man, but I see in him merely the animal
force."</p>

<p>She said after a moment: "Do you hate him&mdash;you plead
against him so passionately?"</p>

<p>He answered: "Can you hate a thing which is not human? No, but
you can dread it. It escapes from the laws which bind you and which
bind me. What standards govern it? How can you hope to win it?
Love? What beauty is there in the world to appeal to such a
creature except the beauty of the marrow-bone which his teeth have
the strength to snap?"</p>

<p>"Ah, listen!" murmured the girl. "Here is your answer!"</p>

<p>And Doctor Randall Byrne heard a sound like the muted music of
the violin, thin and small and wonderfully penetrating. He could
not tell, at first, what it might be. For it was as unlike the
violin as it was like the bow and the rosined strings. Then he made
out, surely, that it was the whistling of a human being.</p>

<p>It followed no tune, no reasoned theme. The music was beautiful
in its own self. It rose straight up like the sky-lark from the
ground, sheer up against the white light of the sky, and there it
sang against heaven's gate. He had never heard harmony like it. He
would never again hear such music, so thin and yet so full that it
went through and through him, until he felt the strains take a new,
imitative life within him. He would have whistled the strains
himself, but he could not follow them. They escaped him, they
soared above him. They followed no law or rhythm. They flew on
wings and left him far below. The girl moved away from him as if
led by an invisible hand, and now she stood at the extremity of the
porch. He followed her.</p>

<p>"Do you hear?" she cried, turning to him.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"It is he! Don't you understand?"</p>

<p>"Barry? Yes! But what does the whistling mean; is it for his
wolf-dog?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she answered quickly. "All I understand is that
it is beautiful. Where are your theories and explanations now,
Doctor Byrne?".</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> beautiful&mdash;God knows!&mdash;but doesn't the
wolf-dog understand it better than either you or I?"</p>

<p>She turned and faced Byrne, standing very close, and when she
spoke there was something in her voice which was like a light. In
spite of the dark he could guess at every varying shade of her
expression.</p>

<p>"To the rest of us," she murmured, "Dan has nothing but silence,
and hardly a glance. Buck saved his life to-night, and yet Dan
remembered nothing except the blow which had been struck. And
now&mdash;now he pours out all the music in his soul for a dumb
beast. Listen!"</p>

<p>He saw her straighten herself and stand taller.</p>

<p>"Then through the wolf&mdash;I'll conquer through the dumb
beast!"</p>

<p>She whipped past Byrne and disappeared into the house; at the
same instant the whistling, in the midst of a faint, high climax,
broke, shivered, and was ended. There was only the darkness and the
silence around Byrne, and the unsteady wind against his face.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap25" name="chap25">25. WERE-WOLF</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Doctor Byrne, pacing the front veranda with his
thoughtful head bowed, saw Buck Daniels step out with his quirt
dangling in his hand, his cartridge belt buckled about his waist,
and a great red silk bandana knotted at his throat.</p>

<p>He was older by ten years than he had been a few days before,
when the doctor first saw him. To be sure, his appearance was not
improved by a three days' growth of beard. It gave his naturally
dark skin a dirty cast, but even that rough stubble could not
completely shroud the new hollows in Daniels' cheeks. His long,
black, uncombed hair sagged down raggedly across his forehead,
hanging almost into his eyes; the eyes themselves were sunk in such
formidable cavities that Byrne caught hardly more than two points
of light in the shadows. All the devil-may-care insouciance of Buck
Daniels was quite, quite gone. In its place was a dogged
sullenness, a hang-dog air which one would not care to face of a
dark night or in a lonely place. His manner was that of a man whose
back is against the wall, who, having fled some keen pursuit, has
now come to the end of his tether and prepares for desperate even
if hopeless battle. There was that about him which made the doctor
hesitate to address the cowpuncher.</p>

<p>At length he said: "You're going out for an outing, Mr.
Daniels?"</p>

<p>Buck Daniels started violently at the sound of this voice behind
him, and whirled upon the doctor with such a set and contorted
expression of fierceness that Byrne jumped back.</p>

<p>"Good God, man!" cried the doctor. "What's up with you?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'," answered Buck, gradually relaxing from his first show
of suspicion. "I'm beating it. That's all."</p>

<p>"Leaving us?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Not really!"</p>

<p>"D'you think I ought to stay?" asked Buck, with something of a
sneer.</p>

<p>The doctor hesitated, frowning in a puzzled way. At length he
threw out his hands in a gesture of mute abandonment.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," he said with a faint smile, "I've about
stopped trying to think."</p>

<p>At this Buck Daniels grinned mirthlessly.</p>

<p>"Now you're talkin' sense," he nodded. "They ain't no use in
thinking."</p>

<p>"But why do you leave so suddenly?"</p>

<p>Buck Daniels shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>"I am sure," went on Byrne, "that Miss Cumberland will miss
you."</p>

<p>"She will not," answered the big cowpuncher. "She's got her
hands full with&mdash;<i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"Exactly. But if it is more than she can do, if she makes no
headway with that singular fellow&mdash;she may need
help&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a slow, long-drawn, deep-throated curse
from Buck Daniels.</p>

<p>"Why in hell should I help her with&mdash;<i>him</i>?"</p>

<p>"There is really no reason," answered the doctor, alarmed,
"except, I suppose, old friendship&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn old friendship!" burst out Buck Daniels. "There's an end
to all things and my friendship is worn out&mdash;on both sides.
It's done!"</p>

<p>He turned and scowled at the house.</p>

<p>"Help her to win <i>him</i> over? I'd rather stick the muzzle of
my gun down my throat and pull the trigger. I'd rather see her
marry a man about to hang. Well&mdash;to hell with this place. I'm
through with it. S'long, doc."</p>

<p>But Doctor Byrne ran after him and halted him at the foot of the
steps down from the veranda.</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Daniels," he urged, touching the arm of Buck. "You
really mustn't leave so suddenly as this. There are a thousand
questions on the tip of my tongue."</p>

<p>Buck Daniels regarded the professional man with a hint of
weariness and disgust.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I'll hear the first couple of hundred.
Shoot!"</p>

<p>"First: the motive that sends you away."</p>

<p>"Dan Barry."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;ah&mdash;fear of what he may do?"</p>

<p>"Damn the fear. At least, it's him that makes me go."</p>

<p>"It seems an impenetrable mystery," sighed the doctor. "I saw
you the other night step into the smoking hell of that barn and
keep the way clear for this man. I knew, before that, how you rode
and risked your life to bring Dan Barry back here. Surely those are
proofs of friendship!"</p>

<p>Buck Daniels laughed unpleasantly. He laid a large hand on the
shoulder of the doctor and answered: "If them was the only proofs,
doc, I wouldn't feel the way I do. Proofs of friendship? Dan Barry
has saved me from the&mdash;rope!&mdash;and he's saved me from
dyin' by the gun of Jim Silent. He took me out of a rotten life and
made me a man that could look honest men in the face!"</p>

<p>He paused, swallowing hard, and the doctor's misty, overworked
eyes lighted with some comprehension. He had felt from the first a
certain danger in this big fellow, a certain reckless disregard of
laws and rules which commonly limit the actions of ordinary men.
Now part of the truth was hinted at. Buck Daniels, on a time, had
been outside the law, and Barry had drawn him back to the ways of
men. That explained some of the singular bond that lay between
them.</p>

<p>"That ain't all," went on Buck. "Blood is thick, and I've loved
him better nor a brother. I've gone to hell and back for him. For
him I took Kate Cumberland out of the hands of Jim Silent, and I
left myself in her place. I took her away and all so's she could go
to him. Damn him! And now on account of him I got to leave this
place."</p>

<p>His voice rose to a ringing pitch.</p>

<p>"D'you think it's easy for me to go? D'you think it ain't like
tearing a finger-nail off'n the flesh for me to go away from Kate?
God knows what she means to me! God knows, but if He does, He's
forgotten me!"</p>

<p>Anguish of spirit set Buck Daniels shaking, and the doctor
looked on in amazement. He was like one who reaches in his pocket
for a copper coin and brings out a handful of gold-pieces.</p>

<p>"Kind feelin's don't come easy to me," went on Buck Daniels. "I
been raised to fight. I been raised to hard ridin' and dust in the
throat. I been raised on whiskey and hate. And then I met Dan
Barry, and his voice was softer'n a girl's voice, and his eyes
didn't hold no doubt of me. Me that had sneaked in on him at night
and was goin' to kill him in his sleep&mdash;because my chief had
told me to! That was the Dan Barry what I first knew. He give me
his hand and give me the trust of his eyes, and after he left me I
sat down and took my head between my hands and my heart was like to
bust inside me. It was like the clouds had blowed away from the sun
and let it shine on me for the first time in my life. And I swore
that if the time come I'd repay him. For every cent he give me I'd
pay him back in gold. I'd foller to the end of the world to do what
he bid me do."</p>

<p>His voice dropped suddenly, choked with emotion.</p>

<p>"Oh, doc, they was tears come in my eyes; and I felt sort of
clean inside, and I wasn't ashamed of them tears! That was what Dan
Barry done for me!</p>

<p>"And I <i>did</i> pay him back, as much as I could. I met Kate
Cumberland and she was to me among girls what Dan Barry was to me
among men. I ain't ashamed of sayin' it. I loved her till they was
a dryness like ashes inside me, but I wouldn't even lift up my eyes
to her, because she belonged to him. I follered her around like a
dog. I done her bidding. I asked no questions. What she
wanted&mdash;that was law to me, and all the law I wanted. All that
I done for the sake of Dan Barry. And then I took my life in my
hands for him&mdash;not once, but day after day.</p>

<p>"Then he rode off and left her and I stayed behind. D'you think
it's been easy to stay here? Man, man, I've had to hear her talkin'
about Dan Barry day after day, and never a word for me. And I had
to tell her stories about Dan and what he'd used to do, and she'd
sit with her eyes miles away from me, listenin' an smilin' and me
there hungerin' for just one look out of her eyes&mdash;hungerin'
like a dyin' dog for water. And then for her and Joe I rode down
south and when I met Dan Barry d'you think they was any light in
his eyes when he seen me?</p>

<p>"No, he'd forgotten me the way even a hoss won't forget his
master. Forgot me after a few months&mdash;and after all that'd
gone between us! Not even Kate&mdash;even she was nothin' to him.
But still I kept at it and I brought him back. I had to hurt him to
do it, but God knows it wasn't out of spite that I hit
him&mdash;God knows!</p>

<p>"And when I seen Dan go into that burnin' barn I says to myself:
'Buck, if nothin' is done that wall will fall and there's the end
of Dan Barry. There's the end of him, that ain't any human use, and
when he's finished after a while maybe Kate will get to know that
they's other men in the world besides Dan.' I says that to myself,
deep and still inside me. And then I looked at Kate standin' in
that white thing with her yaller hair all blowin' about her
face&mdash;and I wanted her like a dyin' man wants heaven! But then
I says to myself again: 'No matter what's happened, he's been my
friend. He's been my pal. He's been my bunkie.'</p>

<p>"Doc, you ain't got a way of knowin' what a partner is out here.
Maybe you sit in the desert about a thousand miles from nowhere,
and across the little mesquite fire, there's your pal, the only
human thing in sight. Maybe you go months seein' only him. If
you're sick he takes care of you. If you're blue he cheers you up.
And that's what Dan Barry was to me. So I stands sayin' these
things to myself, and I says: 'If I keep that wall from fallin'
Dan'll know about it, and they won't be no more of that yaller
light in his eyes when he looks at me. That's what I says to
myself, poor fool!</p>

<p>"And I went into the fire and I fought to keep that wall from
fallin'. You know what happened. When I come out, staggerin' and
blind and three parts dead, Dan Barry looks up to me and touches
his face where I'd hit him, and the yaller comes up glimmerin' and
blazin' in his eyes. Then I went back to my room and I fought it
out.</p>

<p>"And here's where I stand now. If I stay here, if I see that
yaller light once more, they won't be no waitin'. Him and me'll
have to have it out right then. Am I a dog, maybe, that I got to
stand around and jump when he calls me?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow&mdash;my dear Mr. Daniels!" cried the horrified
Doctor Byrne. "Surely you're wrong. He wouldn't go so far as to
make a personal attack upon you!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't he? Bah! Not if he was a man, no. I tell you, he ain't
a man; he's what the canuks up north call a were-wolf! There ain't
no mercy or kindness in him. The blood of a man means nothin' to
him. The world would be better rid of him. Oh, he can be soft and
gentle as a girl. Mostly he is. But cross him once and he forgets
all you done for him. Give him a taste of blood and he jumps at
your throat. I tell you, I've seen him do it!"</p>

<p>He broke off with a shudder.</p>

<p>"Doc," he said, in a lower and solemn voice. "Maybe I've said
too much. Don't tell Kate nothin' about why I'm goin'. Let her go
on dreamin' her fool dream. But now hear what I'm sayin'. If Dan
Barry crosses me once more, one of us two dies, and dies damned
quick. It may be me, it may be him, but I've come to the end of my
rope. I'm leavin' this place till Barry gets a chance to come to
his senses and see what I've done for him. That's all. I'm leavin'
this place because they's a blight on it, and that blight is Dan
Barry. I'm leaving this place because&mdash;doc&mdash;because I can
smell the comin' of bloodshed in it. They's a death hangin' over
it. If the lightnin' was to hit and burn it up, house and man, the
range would be better for it!"</p>

<p>And he turned on his heel and strode slowly down towards the
corral. Doctor Byrne followed his progress with staring eyes.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap26" name="chap26">26. THE BATTLE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The chain which fastened Black Bart had been
passed around the trunk of a tree that stood behind the ranch
house, and there the great dog lay tethered. Doctor Byrne had told
Whistling Dan, with some degree of horror, that the open air was in
the highest degree dangerous to wounds, but Whistling Dan had
returned no answer. So Black Bart lay all day in the soft sand,
easing himself from time to time into a new position, and his
thoughtful eyes seemed to be concentrated on the desire to grow
well. Beside him was the chair in which Dan Barry sat for many an
hour of the day and even the night.</p>

<p>Kate Cumberland watched the animal from the shadow of the house;
his eyes were closed, and the long, powerful head lay inert on the
sand, yet she knew that the wolf-dog was perfectly aware of her
presence. Day after day since he lay there, she had attempted to
approach Black Bart, and day after day he had allowed her to come
within reaching distance of him, only to drive her back at the last
moment by a sudden display of the murderous, long fangs; or by one
of those snarls which came out of the black depths of his heart.
Now, a dog snarls from not far down in its throat, but the noise of
an angered wild beast rolls up out of its very entrails&mdash;a
passion of hate and defiance. And when she heard that sound, or
when she saw the still more terrible silent rage of the beast, Kate
Cumberland's spirit failed, and she would shrink back again to a
safe distance.</p>

<p>She was not easily discouraged. She had that grim resolution
which comes to the gambler after he has played at the same table
night after night, night after night, and lost, lost, lost, until,
playing with the last of his money, he begins to mutter through his
set teeth: "The luck <i>must</i> change!" So it was with Kate
Cumberland. For in Black Bart she saw the only possible clue to
Whistling Dan. There was the stallion, to be sure, but she knew
Satan too well. Nothing in the wide world could induce that wild
heart to accept more than one master&mdash;more than one friend.
For Satan there was in the animal world Black Bart, and in the
world of men, Dan Barry. These were enough. For all the rest he
kept the disdainful speed of his slender legs or the terror of his
teeth and trampling hoofs. Even if she could have induced the
stallion to eat from her hand she could never have made him willing
to trust himself to her guidance. Some such thing she felt that she
must accomplish with Black Bart. To the wild beast with the scarred
and shaggy head she must become a necessary, an accepted thing.</p>

<p>One repulse did not dishearten her. Again and again she made the
trial. She remembered having read that no animal can resist the
thoughtful patience of thinking man, and hour after hour she was
there, until a new light in the eye of the wolf-dog warned her that
the true master was coming.</p>

<p>Then she fled, and from a post of vantage in the house she would
watch the two. An intimacy surpassing the friendships and devotions
of human beings existed between them. She had seen the wolf lie
with his great head on the foot of his master and the unchanging
eyes fixed on Barry's face&mdash;and so for an hour at a stretch in
mute worship. Or she had watched the master go to the great beast
to change the dressing&mdash;a thing which could not be done too
often during the day. She had seen the swift hands remove the
bandages and she had seen the cleansing solution applied. She knew
what it was; it stung even the unscratched skin, and to a wound it
must be torture, but the wolf lay and endured&mdash;not even
shuddering at the pain.</p>

<p>It had seemed to her that this was the great test. If she could
make the wolf lie like this for her, then, truly, she might feel
herself in some measure admitted to that mystic fellowship of the
three&mdash;the man, the stallion, and the wolf. If she could, with
her own unaided hands, remove the bandages and apply that solution,
then she could know many things, and she could feel that she was
nearer to Whistling Dan than ever before.</p>

<p>So she had come, time and again, with the basin and the roll of
cloth in her arm, and she had approached with infinite patience,
step by step, and then inch by inch. Once it had taken a whole hour
for her to come within a yard of the beast. And all that time Black
Bart had lain with closed eyes. But at the critical instant always
there was the silent writhing up of the lips and the gleam of
hate&mdash;or the terrible snarl while the eyes fastened on her
throat. Her heart had stopped in mid-beat; and that day she ran
back into the house and threw herself on her bed, and would not
come from her room till the following morning.</p>

<p>Now, as she watched from the shadow of the house, with the basin
of antiseptic under her arm, the gambler's desperation rose
stronger and stronger. She came out, at length, and walked steadily
towards Black Bart. She had grown almost heedless of fear at this
moment, but when she was within a pace, once more the head reared
back; the teeth flashed. And the heart of Kate Cumberland, as
always, stopped. Yet she did not retreat this time. All the colour
left her face, so that her eyes seemed amazingly blue and wide. One
foot drew back, tremblingly ready to spring to safety; yet she held
her place. She moved&mdash;and it was towards Black Bart.</p>

<p>At that came a snarl that would have made the heart of a lone
grizzly quake and leave his new-found nuts. One further pace she
made&mdash;and the beast plunged up, and braced itself with its one
strong fore leg. A devil of yellow-green gleamed in either eye, and
past the grinning fangs she saw the hot, red throat, and she saw
the flattened ears, the scars on the bony forehead, the muscles
that bulged on the base of the jaw. Ay, strength to drive those
knife-like teeth through flesh and bone at a single snap.
More&mdash;she had seen their effect, and the throat of a bull cut
at a single slash. And yet&mdash;she sank on her knees beside the
monster.</p>

<p>His head was well nigh as high as hers, then; if he attacked
there could be no dream of escape for her. Or she might drag
herself away from the tearing teeth&mdash;a disfigured horror
forever. Think not that an iota of all these terrors missed her
mind. No, she felt the fangs buried in her throat and heard the
snarl of the beast stifled with blood. Yet&mdash;she laid her hand
on the bandage across the shoulder of Black Bart.</p>

<p>His head whirled. With those ears flattened, with that long,
lean neck, it was like the head of a striking snake. Her sleeve was
rolled up to the elbow, and over the bare skin the teeth of the
wolf-dog were set. The snarl had grown so deep and hideous that the
tremor of it fairly shook her, and she saw that the jaws of the
beast slavered with hunger. She knew&mdash;a thousand things about
Black Bart, and among the rest that he had tasted human blood. And
there is a legend which says that once a wild beast has tasted the
blood of man he will taste it a second time before he dies. She
thought of that&mdash;she dared not turn her head lest she should
encounter the hellfire of Bart's eyes. Yet she had passed all
ordinary fear. She had reached that exquisite frenzy of terror when
it becomes one with courage. The very arm over which the wolf's
teeth were set moved&mdash;raised&mdash;and with both hands she
untied the knot of the bandage.</p>

<p>The snarling rose to a pitch of maniacal rage; the teeth
compressed&mdash;if they broke the skin it was the end; the first
taste of blood would be enough!&mdash;and drew away her arm. If she
had started then, all the devil in the creature would be loosed,
for her terror taught her that. And by some mysterious power that
entered her at that moment she was able to turn her head, slowly,
and look deep into those terrible eyes.</p>

<p>Her arm was released.</p>

<p>But Black Bart crouched and the snakelike head lowered; he was
quivering throughout that steel-muscled body to throw himself at
her throat. The finger was on the hair-trigger; it needed a
pressure not greater than a bodiless thought. And still she looked
into the eyes of the wolf-dog; and her terror had made her
strangely light of body and dizzy of mind. Then the change came,
suddenly. The yellow-green changed, swirled in the eyes of Black
Bart; the eyes themselves wavered, and at last looked away; the
snarl dropped to a sullen growl. And Black Bart lay down as he had
been before.</p>

<p>His head was still turned towards her, to be sure. And the teeth
were still bared, as with rapid, deft fingers she undid the
bandage; and from instant to instant, as the bandage in spite of
her care pressed against the wound, the beast shivered and wicked
glances flashed up at her face. The safe-blower who finds his
"soup" cooling and dares not set it down felt as Kate Cumberland
felt then.</p>

<p>She never knew what kept her hands steady, but steady they were.
The cloth was removed, and now she could see the red, angry wound,
with the hair shaven away to a little distance on every side. She
dipped her cloth into the antiseptic; it stung her fingers! She
touched the cloth lightly against the wound; and to her
astonishment the wolf-dog relaxed every muscle and let his head
fall to the ground; also the growl died into a soft whine, and this
in turn ended.</p>

<p>She had conquered! Ay, when the wound was thoroughly cleansed
and when she started to wind the bandage again, she had even the
courage to touch Black Bart's body and make him rise up so that she
could pass the cloth freely. At her touch he shuddered, to be sure,
as a man might shudder at the touch of an unclean thing, but there
was no snarl, and the teeth were not bared.</p>

<p>As she tied the knot which secured the bandage in its place she
was aware that the eyes of Bart, no longer yellow-green, watched
her; and she felt some vague movement of the wonder that was
passing through the brute mind. Then the head of the wolf-dog
jerked up; he was staring at something in the distance, and there
was nothing under heaven that Bart would raise his head to look at
in this manner except one thing. The fingers of Kate grew stiff,
and trembled. Slowly, in a panic, she finished the knot, and then
she was aware of someone who had approached without sound and now
stood behind her.</p>

<p>She looked up, at length, before she rose to her feet.</p>

<p>Thankfulness welled up warm in her heart to find her voice
steady and commonplace when she said: "The wound is much better.
Bart will be well in a very few days now."</p>

<p>Whistling Dan did not answer, and his wondering eyes glanced
past her own. She saw that he was staring at a double row of white
indentations on her forearm, where the teeth of Black Bart had set.
He knew those marks, and she knew he knew. Strength was leaving
her, and weakness went through her&mdash;water where blood should
have been. She dared not stay. In another moment she would be
hopelessly in the grip of hysteria.</p>

<p>So she rose, and passed Dan without a word, and went slowly
towards the house. She tried to hurry, indeed, but her legs would
not quicken their pace. Yet at length she had reached shelter and
no sooner was she past the door of the house than her knees
buckled; she had to steady herself with both hands as she dragged
herself up the stairs to her room. There, from the window, she
looked down and saw Whistling Dan standing as she had left him,
staring blankly at the wolf-dog.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap27" name="chap27">27. THE CONQUEST</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">There was no star-storming confidence in Kate
Cumberland after that first victory. Rather she felt as the general
who deploys his skirmishers and drives in the outposts of an enemy.
The advantage is his, but it has really only served to give him
some intimation of the strength of the enemy. At the supper table
this night she found Whistling Dan watching her&mdash;not openly,
for she could never catch his eye&mdash;but subtly, secretly, she
knew that he was measuring her, studying her; whether in hostility,
amity, or mere wonder, she could not tell. Finally a vast
uneasiness overtook her and she turned to the doctor for relief.
Doctor Randall Byrne held a singular position in the attention of
Kate. Since the night of the fire and her open talk with him, the
doctor knew "everything," and women are troubled in the presence of
a man who knows the details of the past.</p>

<p>The shield behind which they hide in social intercourse is a
touch of mystery&mdash;or at least a hope of mystery. The doctor,
however, was not like other men; he was more similar to a
precocious child and she comforted herself in his obvious talent
for silence. If he had been alert, strong, self-confident, she
might have hated him because he knew so much about her; but when
she noted the pale, thoughtful face, the vast forehead outbalancing
the other features, and the wistful, uncertain eyes, she felt
nothing towards him stronger than pity.</p>

<p>It is good for a woman to have something which she may pity, a
child, an aged parent, or a house-dog. It provides, in a way, the
background against which she acts; so Kate, when in doubt, turned
to the doctor, as on this night. There was a certain cruelty in it,
for when she smiled at him the poor doctor became crimson, and when
she talked to him his answers stumbled on his tongue; and when she
was silent and merely looked at him that was worst of all, for he
became unable to manage knife and fork and would sit crumbling
bread and looking frightened. Then he was apt to draw out his
glasses and make a move to place them on his nose, but he always
caught and checked himself in time&mdash;which added to his
embarrassment.</p>

<p>These small maneuvres had not lasted long before the girl became
aware that the silent attention of Whistling Dan had passed from
her to the doctor&mdash;and held steadily upon him. She did not go
so far as to call it jealousy, but certainly it was a grave and
serious consideration that measured the doctor up and down and back
again; and it left her free to examine the two men in contrast. For
the first time it struck her that they were much alike in many
ways. Physically, for instance, there was the same slenderness, the
same delicacy with which the details were finished&mdash;the same
fragile hands, for instance. The distinction lay in a suggestion of
strength and inexhaustible reserve of energy which Dan Barry
possessed. The distinction lay still more in their faces. That of
Byrne was worn and palled from the long quest and struggle for
truth; the body was feeble; the eyes were uncertain; but within
there was a powerful machine which could work infallibly from the
small to the large and the large to the small. With Whistling Dan
there was no suggestion at all of mental care. She could not
imagine him worrying over a problem. His knowledge was not even
communicable by words; it was more impalpable than the instinct of
a woman; and there was about him the wisdom and the coldness of
Black Bart himself.</p>

<p>The supper ended too soon for Kate. She had been rallying
Randall Byrne, and as soon as he could graciously leave, the poor
fellow rose with a crimson face and left the room; and behind him,
sauntering apparently in the most casual manner, went Whistling
Dan. As for Kate Cumberland, she could not put all the inferences
together&mdash;she dared not; but when she lay in her bed that
night it was a long time before she could sleep, for there was a
voice inside her, singing.</p>

<p>She chose her time the next day. Dan alternated between Black
Bart and old Joe Cumberland during most of the day, and no sooner
had he left the wolf-dog in the morning than she went out to
Bart.</p>

<p>As always, Black Bart lay with his head flattened against the
sand, dreaming in the sun, and not an eyelid quivered when she
approached, yet she understood perfectly that the animal knew every
move she made. She would have attempted to dress the wound again,
but the memory of the ordeal of yesterday was too terrible. She
might break down in the midst of her effort, and the first sign of
weakness, she knew, was the only spur which Black Bart needed. So
she went, instead, to the chair where Dan often sat for hours near
the dog, and there she took her place, folded her hands on her lap,
and waited. She had no particular plan in mind, more than that she
hoped to familiarize the great brute with the sight of her. Once he
had known her well enough, but now he had forgotten all that passed
before as completely, no doubt, as Whistling Dan himself had
forgotten.</p>

<p>While she sat there, musing, she remembered a scene that had
occurred not many a month before. She had been out walking one fall
day, and had gone from the house down past the corrals where a
number of cattle newly driven in from the range were penned. They
were to be driven off for shipment the next day. A bellowing caught
her ear from one of the enclosures and she saw two bulls standing
horn to horn, their heads lowered, and their puffing and snorting
breaths knocking up the dust while they pawed the sand back in
clouds against their flanks. While she watched, they rushed
together, bellowing, and for a moment they swayed back and forth.
It was an unequal battle, however, for one of the animals was a
hardened veteran, scarred from many a battle on the range, while
the other was a young three-year old with a body not half so strong
as his heart. For a short time he sustained the weight of the
larger bull, but eventually his knees buckled, and then dropped
heavily against the earth. At that the older bull drew back a
little and charged again. This time he avoided the long horns of
his rival and made the unprotected flank of the animal his target.
If he had charged squarely the horns would have been buried to the
head; but striking at an angle only one of them touched the target
and delivered a long, ripping blow. With the blood streaming down
his side, the wounded bull made off into a group of cows, and when
the victor pursued him closely, he at length turned tail and leaped
the low fence&mdash;for the corral was a new one, hastily built for
the occasion. The conqueror raised his head inside the fence and
bellowed his triumph, and outside the fence the other commenced
pawing up the sand again, switching his tail across his bleeding
side, and turning his little red eyes here and there. They fixed,
at length, upon Kate Cumberland, and she remembered with a start of
horror that she was wearing a bright red blouse. The next instant
the bull was charging. She turned in a hopeless flight. Safety was
hundreds of yards away in the house; the skirts tangled about her
legs; and behind her the dull impacts of the bull's hoofs swept
close and closer. Then she heard a snarl in front, a deep-throated,
murderous snarl, and she saw Black Bart racing towards her. He
whizzed by her like a black thunderbolt; there was a roar and
bellow behind her, and at the same time she stumbled over a
fence-board and fell upon her knees. But when she cast a glance of
terror behind her she saw the bull lying on its side with lolling
tongue and glazing eyes and the fangs of Black Bart were buried in
its throat.</p>

<p>When she reached this point in her musings her glance naturally
turned towards the wolf-dog, and she started violently when she saw
that Bart was slinking towards her, trailing the helpless leg. The
moment he felt her eyes upon him, Bart dropped down, motionless,
with a wicked baring of his teeth; his eyes closed, and he seemed,
as usual, dreaming in the sun.</p>

<p>Was the brute stalking her? It was worse, in a way, than the
ordeal of the day before, this stealthy, noiseless approach. And in
her panic she first thought of springing from her chair and
reaching a distance which the chain would keep him from following.
Yet it was very strange. Black Bart in his wildest days after Dan
brought him to the ranch had never been prone to wantonly attack
human beings. Infringe upon his right, come suddenly upon him, and
then, indeed, there was a danger to all saving his master. But this
daylight stalking was stranger than words could tell.</p>

<p>She forced her eyes to look straight ahead and sat with a
beating heart, waiting. Then, by slow degrees, she let her glance
travel cautiously back towards Bart without turning her head. There
was no doubt about it! The great wolf-dog was slinking towards her
on his belly, still trailing the wounded foreleg. There was
something snakelike in that slow approach, so silent and so
gradual.</p>

<p>And yet she waited, moving neither hand nor foot.</p>

<p>A sort of nightmare paralysis held her, as when we flee from
some horror in our dreams and find that our limbs have grown numb.
Behind us races the deadly thing, closer and closer; before us is
the door of safety&mdash;only a step to reach it&mdash;and yet we
cannot move a foot!</p>

<p>It was not all pure terror. There was an incredible excitement
as well&mdash;her will against the will of the dumb
brute&mdash;which would conquer?</p>

<p>She heard a faint rustling of the sand beside her and could
hardly keep from turning her head again. But she succeeded. Waves
of coldness broke on her mind; her whole body would have shuddered
had not fear chilled her into motionlessness. All reason told her
that it was madness to sit there with the stealthy horror sliding
closer; even now it might be too late. If she rose the shaggy form
might spring from the ground at her. Perhaps the wolf had treasured
up the pain from the day before and now&mdash;</p>

<p>A black form did, indeed, rise from the ground, but slowly. And
standing on three legs, Bart stood a moment and stared in the face
of the girl. The fear rushed out of her heart; and her face flushed
hotly with relief. There was no enmity in the steady stare of the
wolf-dog. She could feel that even though she did not look.
Something that Whistling Dan had said long before came to her:
"Even a hoss and a dog, Kate, can get terrible lonesome."</p>

<p>Black Bart moved until he faced her directly. His ears were
pricking in eagerness; she heard a snarl, but so low and muffled
that there was hardly a threat in it; could it be a plea for
attention? She would not look down to the sharp eyes, until a
weight fell on her knees&mdash;it was the long, scarred head of the
wolf! The joy that swelled in her was so great that it pained her
like a grief.</p>

<p>She stretched out her hand, slowly, slowly towards that head.
And Black Bart shrank and quivered, and his lips writhed back from
the long, deadly teeth, and his snarl grew to a harsher, hoarser
threat; still he did not remove his head, and he allowed the hand
to touch him between the eyes and stroke the fur back to between
the ears. Only one other hand had ever touched that formidable head
in such a manner! The teeth no longer showed; the keen, suspicious
eyes grew dim with pleasure; the snarl sank to murmur and then died
out.</p>

<p>"Bart!" commanded the girl, sharply.</p>

<p>The head jerked up, but the questing eyes did not look at her.
He glanced over his shoulder to find the danger that had made her
voice so hard. And she yearned to take the fierce head in her arms;
there were tears she could have wept over it. He was snarling
again, prepared already to battle, and for her sake.</p>

<p>"Bart!" she repeated, more gently. "Lie down!"</p>

<p>He turned his head slowly back to her and looked with the
unspeakable wistfulness of the dumb brutes into her eyes. But there
was only one voice in which Bart could speak, and that was the
harsh, rattling snarl which would have made a mountain-lion check
itself mid-leap and slink back to its lair. In such a voice he
answered Kate, and then sank down, gradually. And he lay still.</p>

<p>So simply, and yet so mysteriously, she was admitted to the
partnership. But though one member of that swift, grim trio had
accepted her, did it mean that the other two would take her in?</p>

<p>A weight sank on her feet and when she looked down she saw that
Black Bart had lowered his head upon them, and so he lay there with
his eyes closed, dreaming in the sun.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="chap28" name="chap28">28. THE TRAIL</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Bandages and antiseptics and constant care, by
themselves, could not have healed Black Bart so swiftly, but nature
took a strong hand. The wound closed with miraculous speed. Three
days after he had laid his head on the feet of Kate Cumberland, the
wolf-dog was hobbling about on three legs and tugging now and again
at the restraining chain; and the day after that the bandages were
taken off and Whistling Dan decided that Bart might run loose. It
was a brief ceremony, but a vital one. Doctor Byrne went out with
Barry to watch the loosing of the dog; from the window of Joe
Cumberland's room he and Kate observed what passed. There was
little hesitancy in Black Bart. He merely paused to sniff the foot
of Randall Byrne, snarl, and then trotted with a limp towards the
corrals.</p>

<p>Here, in a small enclosure with rails much higher than the other
corrals, stood Satan, and Black Bart made straight for the
stallion. He was seen from afar, and the black horse stood waiting,
his head thrown high in the air, his ears pricking forward, the
tail flaunting, a picture of expectancy. So under the lower rail
Bart slunk and stood under the head of Satan, growling terribly. Of
this display of anger the stallion took not the slightest notice,
but lowered his beautiful head until his velvet nose touched the
cold muzzle of Bart. There was something ludicrous about the
greeting&mdash;it was such an odd shade close to the human. It was
as brief as it was strange, for Black Bart at once whirled and
trotted away towards the barns.</p>

<p>By the time Doctor Byrne and Whistling Dan caught up with him,
the wolf-dog was before the heaps and ashes which marked the site
of the burned barn. Among these white and grey and black heaps he
picked his way, sniffing hastily here and there. In the very centre
of the place he sat down suddenly on his haunches, pointed his nose
aloft, and wailed with tremendous dreariness.</p>

<p>"Now," murmured the doctor to Dan, "that strikes me as a
singular manifestation of intelligence in an animal&mdash;he has
found the site of the very barn where he was hurt&mdash;upon my
word! Even fire doesn't affect his memory!"</p>

<p>Here he observed that the face of Whistling Dan had grown grim.
He ran to Bart and crouched beside him, muttering; and Byrne
heard.</p>

<p>"That's about where you was lyin'," said Dan, "and you smell
your own blood on the ground. Keep tryin', Bart. They's something
else to find around here."</p>

<p>The wolf-dog looked his master full in the face with pricking
ears, whined and then started off sniffling busily at the heaps of
ashes.</p>

<p>"The shooting of the dog is quite a mystery," said Byrne, by way
of conversation. "Do you suppose that one of the men from the
bunk-house could have shot him?"</p>

<p>But Dan seemed no longer aware of the doctor's presence. He
slipped here and there with the wolf-dog among the ash-heaps,
pausing when Bart paused, talking to the brute continually.
Sometimes he pointed out to Bart things which the doctor did not
perceive and Bart whined with a terrible, slavering,
blood-eagerness.</p>

<p>The wolf-dog suddenly left the ash-heaps and now darted in
swiftly entangled lines here and there among the barns. Dan Barry
stood thoughtfully still, but now and then he called a word of
encouragement.</p>

<p>And Black Bart stayed with his work. Now he struck out a wide
circle, running always with his nose close to the ground. Again he
doubled back sharply to the barn-site, and began again in a new
direction. He ran swiftly, sometimes putting his injured leg to the
ground with hardly a limp, and again drawing it up and running on
three feet. In a moment he passed out of sight behind a slight rise
of ground to the left of the ash-heaps, and at some little
distance. He did not reappear. Instead, a long, shrill wail came
wavering towards the doctor and Dan Barry. It raised the hair on
the head of the doctor and sent a chill through his veins; but it
sent Whistling Dan racing towards the place behind which Black Bart
had disappeared. The doctor hurried after as fast as he might and
came upon the wolf-dog making small, swift circles, his nose to the
ground, and then crossing to and fro out of the circles. And the
face of the master was black while he watched. He ran again to Bart
and began talking swiftly.</p>

<p>"D'you see?" he asked, pointing. "From behind this here hill you
could get a pretty good sight of the barn&mdash;and you wouldn't be
seen, hardly, from the barn. Someone must have waited here. Look
about, Bart, you'll be findin' a pile of signs, around here. It
means that them that done the shootin' and the firin' of the barn
stood right here behind this hill-top and watched the barn
burn&mdash;and was hopin' that Satan and you wouldn't ever come out
alive. That's the story."</p>

<p>He dropped to his knees and caught Bart as the big dog ran
by.</p>

<p>"Find'em, Bart!" he whispered. "Find'em!"</p>

<p>And he struck sharply on the scar where the bullet had ploughed
its way into Bart's flesh.</p>

<p>The answer of Bart was a yelp too sharp and too highly pitched
to have come from the throat of any mere dog. Once more he darted
out and ran here and there, and Doctor Byrne heard the beast
moaning as it ran. Then Bart ceased circling and cut down the slope
away from the hill at a sharp trot.</p>

<p>A cry of inarticulate joy burst from Dan, and then: "You've
found it! You have it!" and the master ran swiftly after the dog.
He followed the latter only for a short distance down the slope and
then stood still and whistled. He had to repeat the call before the
dog turned and ran back to his master, where he whined eagerly
about the man's feet. There was something uncanny and horrible
about it; it was as if the dumb beast was asking for a life, and
the life of a man. The doctor turned back and walked thoughtfully
to the house.</p>

<p>At the door he was met by Kate and a burst of eager questions,
and he told, simply, all that he had seen.</p>

<p>"You'll get the details from Mr. Barry," he concluded.</p>

<p>"I know the details," answered the girl. "He's found the trail
and he knows where it points, now. And he'll want to be following
it before many hours have passed. Doctor Byrne, I need you
now&mdash;terribly. You must convince Dan that if he leaves us it
will be a positive danger to Dad. Can you do that?"</p>

<p>"At least," said the doctor, "there will be little deception in
that. I will do what I can to persuade him to stay."</p>

<p>"Then," she said hurriedly, "sit here, and I shall sit here.
We'll meet Dan together when he comes in."</p>

<p>They had hardly taken their places when Barry entered, the wolf
at his heels; at the door he paused to flash a glance at them and
then crossed the room. On the farther side he stopped again.</p>

<p>"I might be tellin' you," he said in his soft voice, "that now's
Bart's well I got to be travellin' again. I start in the
morning."</p>

<p>The pleading eyes of Kate raised Byrne to his feet.</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Barry!" he called. The other turned again and
waited. "Do you mean that you will leave us while Mr. Cumberland is
in this critical condition?"</p>

<p>A shadow crossed the face of Barry.</p>

<p>"I'd stay if I could," he answered. "But it ain't possible!"</p>

<p>"What takes you away is your affair, sir," said the doctor. "My
concern is Mr. Cumberland. He is in a very precarious condition.
The slightest nerve shock may have&mdash;fatal&mdash;results."</p>

<p>Dan Barry sighed.</p>

<p>"Seemed to me," he answered, "that he was buckin' up
considerable. Don't look so thin, doc."</p>

<p>"His body may be well enough," said the doctor calmly, "but his
nerves are wrecked. I am afraid to prophesy the consequences if you
leave him."</p>

<p>It was apparent that a great struggle was going on in Barry. He
answered at length: "How long would I have to stay? One rain could
wipe out all the sign and make me like a blind man in the desert.
Doc, how long would I have to stay?"</p>

<p>"A few days," answered Byrne, "may work wonders with him."</p>

<p>The other hesitated.</p>

<p>"I'll go up and talk with him," he said, "and what he wants I'll
do."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap29" name="chap29">29. TALK</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">He was long in getting his answer. The hours
dragged on slowly for Kate and the doctor, for if Joe Cumberland
could hold Dan it was everything to the girl, and if Barry left at
once there might be some root for the hope which was growing
stronger and stronger every day in the heart of Randall Byrne.
Before evening a not unwelcome diversion broke the suspense
somewhat.</p>

<p>It was the arrival of no less a person than Marshal Jeff
Calkins. His shoulders were humped and his short legs bowed from
continual riding, and his head was slung far forward on a gaunt
neck; so that when he turned his head from one to another in
speaking it was with a peculiar pendulum motion. The marshal had a
reputation which was strong over three hundred miles and more of a
mountain-desert. This was strange, for the marshal was a very
talkative man, and talkative men are not popular on the desert; but
it had been discovered that on occasion his six-gun could speak as
rapidly and much more accurately than his tongue. So Marshal
Calkins waxed in favour.</p>

<p>He set the household at ease upon his arrival by announcing that
"they hadn't nothin' for him there." All he wanted was a place to
bunk in, some chow, and a feed for the horse. His trail led past
the Cumberland Ranch many and many a dreary mile.</p>

<p>The marshal was a politic man, and he had early in life
discovered that the best way to get along with any man was to meet
him on his own ground. His opening blast of words at Doctor Byrne
was a sample of his art.</p>

<p>"So you're a doc, hey? Well, sir, when I was a kid I had a colt
that stuck its foreleg in a hole and busted it short and when that
colt had to be shot they wasn't no holdin' me. No, sir, I could of
cleaned up on the whole family. And ever since then I've had a
hankerin' to be a doc. Something about the idea of cuttin' into a
man that always sort of tickled me. They's only one main thing that
holds me back&mdash;I don't like the idea of knifin' a feller when
he ain't got a chance to fight back! That's me!"</p>

<p>To this Doctor Randall Byrne bowed, rather dazed, but returned
no answer.</p>

<p>"And how's your patient, doc?" pursued the irresistible marshal.
"How's old Joe Cumberland? I remember when me and Joe used to trot
about the range together. I was sort of a kid then; but think of
old Joe bein' down in bed&mdash;sick! Why, I ain't never been sick
a day in my life. Sick? I'd laugh myse'f plumb to death if anybody
ever wanted me to go to bed. What's the matter with him,
anyway?"</p>

<p>"His nerves are a bit shaken about," responded the doctor. "To
which I might add that there is superimposed an arterial
condition&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut it short, Doc," cried the marshal goodnaturedly. "I ain't
got a dictionary handy. Nerves bad, eh? Well, I don't wonder about
that. The old man's had enough trouble lately to make anybody
nervous. I wouldn't like to go through it myself. No, sir! What
with that Dan Barry&mdash;I ain't steppin' on any corns, Kate, am
I?"</p>

<p>She smiled vaguely, but the marshal accepted the smile as a
strong dissent.</p>

<p>"They was a time not so long ago when folks said that you was
kind of sweet on Dan. Glad to hear they ain't nothin' in it. 'S a
matter of fact&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here Kate interrupted with a raised hand. She said: "I think
that was the supper gong. Yes, there it is. We'll go in now, if you
wish."</p>

<p>"They's only one sound in the world that's better to me than a
dinner gong," said the profuse marshal, as they seated themselves
around the big dining table, "and that was the sound of my wife's
voice when she said 'I will.' Queer thing, too. Maria ain't got a
very soft voice, most generally speakin', but when she busted up in
front of that preacher and says 'I will,' why, God
A'mighty&mdash;askin' your pardon, Kate&mdash;they was a change
come in her voice that was like a bell chimin' down in her
throat&mdash;a bell ringin' away off far, you know, so's you only
kind of guess at it! But comin' back to you and Dan,
Kate&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was in vain she plied the marshal with edibles. His tongue
wagged upon roller-bearings and knew no stopping. Moreover, the
marshal had spent some portion of his life in a boarding house and
had mastered the boarding-house art of talking while he ate.</p>

<p>"Comin' back to you and Dan, we was all of us sayin' that you
and Dan kind of had an eye for each other. I s'pose we was all
wrong. You see, that was back in the days before Dan busted loose.
When he was about the range most usually he was the quietest man I
ever sat opposite to barrin' one&mdash;and that was a feller that
went west with a bum heart at the chuck table! Ha, ha, ha!" The
marshal's laughter boomed through the big room as he recalled this
delightful anecdote. He went on: "But after that Jim Silent play we
all changed our minds, some. D'you know, doc, I was in Elkhead the
night that Dan got our Lee Haines?"</p>

<p>"I've never heard of the episode," murmured the doctor.</p>

<p>"You ain't? Well, I be damned!&mdash;askin' your pardon,
Kate&mdash;But you sure ain't lived in these parts long! Which you
wouldn't think one man could ride into a whole town, go to the
jail, knock out two guards that was proved men, take the keys,
unlock the irons off'n the man he wanted, saddle a hoss, and ride
through a whole town&mdash;full of folks that was shootin' at him.
Now, would you think that was possible?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"And it <i>ain't</i> possible, I'm here to state. But they was
something different about Dan Barry. D'you ever notice it,
Kate?"</p>

<p>She was far past speech.</p>

<p>"No, I guess you never would have noticed it. You was livin' too
close to him all the time to see how different he was from other
fellers. Anyway, he done it. They say he got plugged while he was
ridin' through the lines and he bled all the way home, and he got
there unconscious. Is that right, Kate?"</p>

<p>He waited an instant and then accepted the silence as an
affirmative.</p>

<p>"Funny thing about that, too. The place where he come to was
Buck Daniels' house. Well, Buck was one of Jim Silent's men, and
they say Buck had tried to plug Dan before that. But Dan let him go
that time, and when Buck seen Dan ride in all covered with blood he
remembered that favour and he kept Dan safe from Jim Silent and
safe from the law until Dan was well. I seen Buck this morning over
to Rafferty's place, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the marshal noted a singular look in the eyes of Kate
Cumberland, a look so singular that he turned in his chair to
follow it. He saw Dan Barry in the act of closing the door behind
him, and Marshal Calkins turned a deep and violent red, varied
instantly by a blotchy yellow which in turn faded to something as
near white as his tan permitted.</p>

<p>"Dan Barry!" gasped the marshal, rising, and he reached
automatically towards his hip before he remembered that he had laid
his belt and guns aside before he entered the dining-room, as
etiquette is in the mountain-desert. For it is held that shooting
at the table disturbs the appetite.</p>

<p>"Good evenin'," said Dan quietly. "Was it Buck Daniels that you
seen at Rafferty's place, Marshal Calkins?"</p>

<p>"Him," nodded the marshal, hoarsely. "Yep, Buck Daniels."</p>

<p>And then he sank into his chair, silent for the first time. His
eyes followed Barry as though hypnotized.</p>

<p>"I'm kind of glad to know where I can find him," said Barry, and
took his place at the table.</p>

<p>The silence continued for a while, with all eyes focused on the
new-comer. It was the doctor who had to speak first.</p>

<p>"You've talked things over with Mr. Cumberland?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We had a long talk," nodded Dan. "You was wrong about him, doc.
He thinks he can do without me."</p>

<p>"What?" cried Kate.</p>

<p>"He thinks he can do without me," said Dan Barry. "We talked it
all over."</p>

<p>The silence fell again. Kate Cumberland was staring blankly down
at her plate, seeing nothing; and Doctor Byrne looked straight
before him and felt the pulse drumming in his throat. His chance,
then, was to come. By this time the marshal had recovered his
breath.</p>

<p>He said to Dan: "Seems like you been away some time, Dan. Where
you been hangin' out?"</p>

<p>"I been ridin' about," answered Dan vaguely.</p>

<p>"Well," chuckled the marshal, "I'm glad they ain't no more Jim
Silents about these parts&mdash;not while you're here and while I'm
here. You kept things kind of busy for Glasgow, Dan."</p>

<p>He turned to Kate, who had pushed back her chair.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Kate?" he boomed. "You ain't lookin' any too
tip-top. Sick?"</p>

<p>"I may be back in a moment," said the girl, "but don't delay
supper for me."</p>

<p>She went out of the room with a step poised well enough, but the
moment the door closed behind her she fairly staggered to the
nearest chair and sank into it, her head fallen back, her eyes dim,
and all the strength gone from her body and her will. Several
minutes passed before she roused herself, and then it was to drag
herself slowly up the stairs to the door of her father's room. She
opened it without knocking, and then closed it and stood with her
back against it, in the shadow.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap30" name="chap30">30. THE VOICE OF BLACK BART</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Her father lay propped high with pillows among
which his head lolled back. The only light in the room was near the
bed and it cast a glow upon the face of Joe Cumberland and on the
white linen, the white hair, the white, pointed beard. All the rest
of the room swam in darkness. The chairs were blotches, indistinct,
uncertain; even the foot of the bed trailed off to nothingness. It
was like one of those impressionistic, very modern paintings, where
the artist centres upon one point and throws the rest of his canvas
into dull oblivion. The focus here was the face of the old
cattleman. The bedclothes, never stirred, lay in folds sharply cut
out with black shadows, and they had a solid seeming, as the
mort-cloth rendered in marble over the effigy. That suggested
weight exaggerated the frailty of the body beneath the clothes.
Exhausted by that burden, the old man lay in the arms of a deadly
languor, so that there was a kinship of more than blood between him
and Kate at this moment. She stepped to the side of the bed and
stood staring down at him, and there was little gentleness in her
expression. So cold was that settled gaze that her father stirred,
at length, shivered, and without opening his eyes, fumbled at the
bed-spread and drew it a little more closely about his shoulders.
Even that did not give him rest; and presently the wrinkled eyelids
opened and he looked up at his daughter. A film of weariness
heavier than sleep at first obscured his sight, but this in turn
cleared away; he frowned a little to clear his vision, and then
wagged his head slowly from side to side.</p>

<p>"Kate," he said feebly, "I done my best. It simply wasn't good
enough."</p>

<p>She answered in a voice as low as his, but steadier: "What could
have happened? Dad, what happened to make you give up every hold on
Dan? What was it? You were the last power that could keep him here.
You knew it. Why did you tell him he could go?"</p>

<p>The monotone was more deadly than any emphasis of a raised
word.</p>

<p>"If you'd been here," pleaded Joe Cumberland, "you'd have done
what I done. I couldn't help it. There he sat on the foot of the
bed&mdash;see where them covers still kind of sag down&mdash;after
he told me that he had something to do away from the ranch and that
he wanted to go now that Black Bart was well enough to travel in
short spells. He asked me if I still needed him."</p>

<p>"And you told him no?" she cried. "Oh Dad, you know it means
everything to me&mdash;but you told him no?" He raised a shaking
hand to ward off the outburst and stop it.</p>

<p>"Not at first, honey. Gimme a chance to talk, Kate. At first I
told him that I needed him&mdash;and God knows that I <i>do</i>
need him. I dunno why&mdash;not even Doc Byrne knows what there is
about Dan that helps me. I told Dan all them things. And he didn't
say nothin', but jest sat still on the foot of the bed and looked
at me.</p>

<p>"It ain't easy to bear his eyes, Kate. I lay here and tried at
first to smile at him and talk about other things&mdash;but it
ain't easy to bear his eyes. You take a dog, Kate. It ain't
supposed to be able to look you in the eye for long; but s'pose you
met up with a dog that could. It'd make you feel sort of queer
inside. Which I felt that way while Dan was lookin' at me. Not that
he was threatenin' me. No, it wasn't that. He was only thoughtful,
but I kept gettin' more nervous and more fidgety. I felt after a
while like I couldn't stand it. I had to crawl out of bed and begin
walkin' up and down till I got quieter. But I seen that wouldn't
do.</p>

<p>"Then I begun to think. I thought of near everything in a little
while. I thought of what would happen s'pose Dan should stay here.
Maybe you and him would get to like each other again. Maybe you'd
get married. Then what would happen?</p>

<p>"I thought of the wild geese flyin' north in the spring o' the
year and the wild geese flyin' south in the fall o' the year. And I
thought of Dan with his heart followin' the wild geese&mdash;God
knows why!&mdash;and I seen a picture of him standin' and watchin'
them, with you nearby and not able to get one look out of him. I
seen that, and it made my blood chilly, like the air on a frosty
night.</p>

<p>"Kate, they's something like the power of prophecy that comes to
a dyin' man!"</p>

<p>"Dad!" she cried. "What are you saying?"</p>

<p>She slipped to her knees beside the bed and drew his cold hands
towards her, but Joe Cumberland shook his head and mildly drew one
hand away. He raised it, with extended forefinger&mdash;a sign of
infinite warning; and with the glow of the lamp full upon his face,
the eyes were pits of shadow with stirring orbs of fire in the
depths.</p>

<p>"No, I ain't dead now," he said, "but I ain't far away from it.
Maybe days, maybe weeks, maybe whole months. But I've passed the
top of the hill, and I know I'm ridin' down the slope. Pretty soon
I'll finish the trail. But what little time I've got left is worth
more'n everything that went before. I can see my life behind me and
the things before like a cold mornin' light was over it
all&mdash;you know before the sun begins to beat up the waves of
heat and the mist gets tanglin' in front of your eyes? You know
when you can look right across a thirty mile valley and name the
trees, a'most the other side? That's the way I can see now. They
ain't no feelin' about it. My body is all plumb paralyzed. I jest
see and know&mdash;that's all.</p>

<p>"And what I see of you and Dan&mdash;if you ever marry&mdash;is
plain&mdash;hell! Love ain't the only thing they is between a man
and a woman. They's something else. I dunno what it is. But it's a
sort of a common purpose; it's havin' both pairs of feet steppin'
out on the same path. That's what it is. But your trail would go
one way and Dan's would go another, and pretty soon your love
wouldn't be nothin' but a big wind blowin' between two
mountains&mdash;and all it would do would be to freeze up the blood
in your hearts."</p>

<p>"I seen all that, while Dan was sittin' at the foot of the bed.
Not that I don't want him here. When I see him I see the world the
way it was when I was under thirty. When there wasn't nothin' I
wouldn't try once, when all I wanted was a gun and a hoss and a
song to keep me from tradin' with kings. No, it ain't goin' to be
easy for me when Dan goes away. But what's my tag-end of life
compared with yours? You got to be given a chance; you got to be
kept away from Dan. That's why I told him, finally, that I thought
I could get along without him."</p>

<p>"Whether or not you save me," she answered, "you signed a death
warrant for at least two men when you told him that."</p>

<p>"Two men? They's only one he's after&mdash;and Buck Daniel has
had a long start. He can't be caught!"</p>

<p>"That Marshal Calkins is here to-night. He saw Buck at
Rafferty's, and he talked about it in the hearing of Dan at the
table. I watched Dan's face. You may read the past and see the
future, Dad, but I know Dan's face. I can read it as the sailor
reads the sea. Before to-morrow night Buck Daniels will be dead;
and Dan's hands will be red."</p>

<p>She dropped her head against the bedclothes and clasped her
fingers over the bright hair.</p>

<p>When she could speak again she raised her head and went on in
the same swift, low monotone: "And besides, Black Bart has found
the trail of the man who fired the barn and shot him. And the body
of Buck won't be cold before Dan will be on the heels of the other
man. Oh, Dad, two lives lay in the hollow of your hand. You could
have saved them by merely asking Dan to stay with you; but you've
thrown them away."</p>

<p>"Buck Daniels!" repeated the old man, the horror of the thing
dawning on him only slowly. "Why didn't he get farther away? Why
didn't he ride night and day after he left us? He's got to be
warned that Dan is coming!"</p>

<p>"I've thought of that. I'm going into my room now to write a
note and send it to Buck by one of our men. But at the most he'll
have less than a day's start&mdash;and what is a day to Satan and
Dan Barry?"</p>

<p>"I thought it was for the best," muttered old Joe. "I couldn't
see how it was wrong. But I can send for Dan and tell him that I've
changed my mind." He broke off in a groan. "No, that wouldn't be no
good. He's set his mind on going by this time, and nothing can keep
him back. But&mdash;Kate, maybe I can delay him. Has he gone up to
his room yet?"</p>

<p>"He's in there now. Talk softly or he'll hear us. He's walking
up and down, now."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, ay!" nodded old Joe, his eyes widening with horror,
"and his footfall is like the padding of a big cat. I could tell it
out of a thousand steps. And I know what's going on inside his
mind!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; he's thinking of the blow Buck Daniels struck him;
he's thinking of the man who shot down Bart. God save them
both!"</p>

<p>"Listen!" whispered the cattleman. "He's raised the window. I
heard the rattle of the weights. He's standing there in front of
the window, letting the wind of the night blow in his face!"</p>

<p>The wind from the window, indeed, struck against the door
communicating with Joe Cumberland's room, and shook it as if a hand
were rattling at the knob.</p>

<p>The girl began to speak again, as swiftly as before, her voice
the barely audible rushing of a whisper: "The law will trail him,
but I won't give him up. Dad, I'm going to fight once more to keep
him here&mdash;and if I fail, I'll follow him around the world."
Such words should have come loudly, ringing. Spoken so softly, they
gave a terrible effect; like the ravings of delirium, or the
monotone of insanity. And with the white light against her face she
was more awe-inspiring than beautiful. "He loved me once; and the
fire must still be in him; such fire <i>can't</i> go out, and I'll
fan it back to life, and then if it burns me&mdash;if it burns us
both&mdash;the fire itself cannot be more torture than to live on
like this!"</p>

<p>"Hush, lass!" murmured her father. "Listen to what's
coming!"</p>

<p>It was a moan, very low pitched, and then rising slowly, and
gaining in volume, rising up the scale with a dizzy speed, till it
burst and rang through the house&mdash;the long-drawn wail of a
wolf when it hunts on a fresh trail.</p>

<h2><a id="chap31" name="chap31">31. THE MESSAGE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Buck Daniels opened his eyes and sat bolt-upright
in bed. He had dreamed the dream again, and this time, as always,
he awakened before the end. He needed no rubbing of eyes to rouse
his senses. If a shower of cold water had been dashed upon him he
could not have rallied from sound slumber so suddenly. His first
movement was to snatch his gun from under his mattress, not that he
dreamed of needing it, but for some reason the pressure of the butt
against his palm was reassuring. It was better than the grip of his
friend&mdash;a strong man.</p>

<p>It was the first grey of dawn, a light so feeble that it served
merely to illuminate the darkness, so to speak. It fell with any
power upon one thing alone, the bit of an old, dusty bridle that
hung against the wall, and it made the steel glitter like a
watchful eye. There was a great dryness in the throat of Buck
Daniels; and his whole big body shook with the pounding of his
heart.</p>

<p>He was not the only thing that was awake in the grey hour. For
now he caught a faint and regular creaking of the stairs. Someone
was mounting with an excessively cautious and patient step, for
usually the crazy stairs that led up to this garret room of the
Rafferty house creaked and groaned a protest at every footfall. Now
the footfall paused at the head of the stairs, as when one stops to
listen.</p>

<p>Buck Daniels raised his revolver and levelled it on the door;
but his hand was shaking so terribly that he could not keep his
aim&mdash;the muzzle kept veering back and forth across the door.
He seized his right hand with his left, and crushed it with a
desperate pressure. Then it was better. The quivering of the two
hands counteracted each other and he managed to keep some sort of a
bead.</p>

<p>Now the step continued again, down the short hall. A hand fell
on the knob of the door and pressed it slowly open. Against the
deeper blackness of the hall beyond, Buck saw a tall figure,
hatless. His finger curved about the trigger, and still he did not
fire. Even to his hysterical brain it occurred that Dan Barry would
be wearing a hat&mdash;and moreover the form was tall.</p>

<p>"Buck!" called a guarded voice.</p>

<p>The muzzle of Daniels' revolver dropped; he threw the gun on his
bed and stood up.</p>

<p>"Jim Rafferty!" he cried, with something like a groan in his
voice. "What in the name of God are you doin' here at this
hour?"</p>

<p>"Someone come here and banged on the door a while ago. Had a
letter for you. Must have rid a long ways and come fast; while he
was givin' me the letter at the door I heard his hoss pantin'
outside. He wouldn't stay, but went right back. Here's the letter,
Buck. Hope it ain't no bad news. Got a light here, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"All right, Jim," answered Buck Daniels, taking the letter. "I
got a lantern. You get back to bed."</p>

<p>The other replied with a noisy yawn and left the room while Buck
kindled the lantern. By that light he read his name upon the
envelope and tore it open. It was very brief.</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear Buck,<br>
<br>
"Last night at supper Dan found out where you are. In the morning
he's leaving the ranch and we know that he intends to ride for
Rafferty's place; he'll probably be there before noon. The moment
you get this, saddle your horse and ride. Oh, Buck, why did you
stay so close to us? Relay your horses. Don't stop until you're
over the mountains. Black Bart is well enough to take the trail and
Dan will use him to follow you. You know what that means. "Ride,
ride, ride!<br>
<br>
"Kate."</p>

<p>He crumpled up the paper and sank back upon the bed.</p>

<p>"Why did you stay so close?"</p>

<p>He had wondered at that, himself, many times in the past few
days. Like the hunted rabbit, he expected to find safety under the
very nose of danger. Now that he was discovered it seemed
incredible that he could have followed so patently foolish a
course. In a sort of daze he uncrumpled the note again and read the
wrinkled writing word by word. He had leaned close to read by the
uncertain light, and now he caught the faintest breath of perfume
from the paper. It was a small thing, smaller among scents than a
whisper is among voices, but it made Buck Daniels drop his head and
crush the paper against his face. It was a moment before he could
uncrumple the paper sufficiently to study the contents of the note
thoroughly. At first his dazed brain caught only part of the
significance. Then it dawned on him that the girl thought he had
fled from the Cumberland Ranch through fear of Dan Barry.</p>

<p>Ay, there had been fear in it. Every day at the ranch he had
shuddered at the thought that the destroyer might ride up on that
devil of black silken grace, Satan. But every day he had convinced
himself that even then Dan Barry remembered the past and was
cursing himself for the ingratitude he had shown his old friend.
Now the truth swept coldly home to Buck Daniels. Barry was as
fierce as ever upon the trail, and Kate Cumberland thought that he,
Buck Daniels, had fled like a cur from danger.</p>

<p>He seized his head between his hands and beat his knuckles
against the corrugated flesh of his forehead. She had thought
that!</p>

<p>Desire for action, action, action, beset him like thirst. To
close with this devil, this wolf-man, to set his big fingers in the
smooth, almost girlish throat, to choke the yellow light out of
those eyes&mdash;or else to die, but like a man proving his manhood
before the girl.</p>

<p>He read the letter again and then in an agony he crumpled it to
a ball and hurled it across the room. Catching up his hat and his
belt he rushed wildly from the room, thundered down the crazy
stairs, and out to the stable.</p>

<p>Long Bess, the tall, bay mare which had carried him through
three years of adventure and danger and never failed him yet,
raised her aristocratic head above the side of the stall and
whinnied. For answer he shook his fist at her and cursed
insanely.</p>

<p>The saddle he jerked by one stirrup leather from the wall and
flung it on her back, and when she cringed to the far side of the
stall, he cursed her again, bitterly, and drew up the cinch with a
lunge that made her groan. He did not wait to lead her to the door
before mounting, but sprang into the saddle.</p>

<p>Here he whirled her about and drove home the spurs. Cruel usage,
for Long Bess had never denied him the utmost of her speed and
strength at the mere sound of his voice. Now, half-mad with fear
and surprise, she sprang forward at full gallop, slipped and almost
sprawled on the floor, and then thundered out of the door.</p>

<p>At once the soft sandy-soil received and deadened the impact of
her hoofs. Off she flew through the grey of the morning, soundless
as a racing ghost.</p>

<p>Long Bess&mdash;there was good blood in her. She was as
delicately limbed as an antelope, and her heart was as strong as
the smooth muscles of her shoulders and hips. Yet to Buck Daniels
her fastest gait seemed slower than a walk. Already his thoughts
were flying far before. Already he stood before the ranch house
calling to Dan Barry. Ay, at the very door of the place they should
meet and one of them must die. And better by far that the blood of
him who died should stain the hands of Kate Cumberland.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap32" name="chap32">32. VICTORY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The grey light, which Buck Daniels saw that
morning, hardly brightened as the day grew, for the sky was
overcast with sheeted mist and through it a dull evening radiance
filtered to the earth. Wung Lu, his celestial, slant eyes now
yellow with cold, built a fire on the big hearth in the
living-room. It was a roaring blaze, for the wood was so dry that
it flamed as though soaked in oil, and tumbled a mass of yellow
fire up the chimney. So bright was the fire, indeed, that its light
quite over-shadowed the meagre day which looked in at the window,
and every chair cast its shadow away from the hearth. Later on Kate
Cumberland came down the backstairs and slipped into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Dan?" she asked of the cook.</p>

<p>"Wung Lu make nice fire," grinned the Chinaman. "Misser Dan in
there."</p>

<p>She thought for an instant.</p>

<p>"Is breakfast ready, Wung?"</p>

<p>"Pretty soon quick," nodded Wung Lu.</p>

<p>"Then throw out the coffee or the eggs," she said quickly. "I
don't want breakfast served yet; wait till I send you word."</p>

<p>As the door closed behind her, the eye-brows of Wung rose into
perfect Roman arches.</p>

<p>"Ho!" grunted Wung Lu, "O ho!"</p>

<p>In the hall Kate met Randall Byrne coming down the stairs. He
was dressed in white and he had found a little yellow wildflower
and stuck it in his button-hole. He seemed ten years younger than
the day he rode with her to the ranch, and now he came to her with
a quick step, smiling.</p>

<p>"Doctor Byrne," she said quietly, "breakfast will be late this
morning. Also, I want no one to go into the living-room for a
while. Will you keep them out?"</p>

<p>The doctor's smile was instantly gone.</p>

<p>"He hasn't gone, yet?" he queried.</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>The doctor sighed and then, apparently following a sudden
impulse, he reached his hand to her.</p>

<p>"I hope something comes of it," he said.</p>

<p>Even then she could not help a wan smile.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that, doctor?"</p>

<p>The doctor sighed again.</p>

<p>"If the inference is not clear," he said, "I'm afraid that I
cannot explain. But I'll try to keep everyone from the room."</p>

<p>She nodded her thanks, and went on; but passing the mirror in
the hall the sight of her face made her stop abruptly. There was no
vestige of colour in it, and the shadow beneath her eyes made them
seem inhumanly large and deep. The bright hair, to be sure, waved
over her head and coiled on her neck, but it was like a futile
shaft of sunlight falling on a dreary moor in winter. She went on
thoughtfully to the door of the living-room but there she paused
again with her hand upon the knob; and while she stood there she
remembered herself as she had been only a few months before, with
the colour flushing in her face and a continual light in her eyes.
There had been little need for thinking then. One had only to let
the wind and the sun strike on one, and live. Then, in a quiet
despair, she said to herself: "As I am&mdash;I must win or
lose&mdash;as I am!" and she opened the door and stepped in.</p>

<p>She had been cold with fear and excitement when she entered the
room to make her last stand for happiness, but once she was in, it
was not so hard. Dan Barry lay on the couch at the far end of the
room with his hands thrown under his head, and he was smiling in a
way which she well knew; it had been a danger signal in the old
days, and when he turned his face and said good-morning to her, she
caught that singular glimmer of yellow which sometimes came up
behind his eyes. In reply to his greeting she merely nodded, and
then walked slowly to the window and turned her back to him.</p>

<p>It was a one-tone landscape. Sky, hills, barns, earth, all was a
single mass of lifeless grey; in such an atmosphere old Homer had
seen the wraiths of his dead heroes play again at the things they
had done on earth. She noted these things with a blank eye, for a
thousand thoughts were leaping through her mind. Something must be
done. There he lay in the same room with her. He had turned his
head back, no doubt, and was staring at the ceiling as before, and
the yellow glimmer was in his eyes again. Perhaps, after this day,
she should never see him again; every moment was precious beyond
the price of gold, and yet there she stood at the window, doing
nothing. But what <i>could</i> she do?</p>

<p>Should she go to him and fall on her knees beside him and pour
out her heart, telling him again of the old days? No, it would be
like striking on a wooden bell; no echo would rise; and she knew
beforehand the deadly blackness of his eyes. So Black Bart lay
often in the sun, staring at infinite distance and seeing nothing
but his dreams of battle. What were appeals and what were words to
Black Bart? What were they to Dan Barry? Yet once, by sitting
still&mdash;the thought made her blood leap with a great, joyous
pulse that set her cheeks tingling.</p>

<p>She waited till the first impulse of excitement had subsided,
and then turned back and sat down in a chair near the fire. From a
corner of her eye she was aware that Whistling Dan had turned his
head again to await her first speech. Then she fixed her gaze on
the wall of yellow flame. The impulse to speak to him was like a
hand tugging to turn her around, and the words came up and swelled
in her throat, but still she would not stir.</p>

<p>In a moment of rationality she felt in an overwhelming wave of
mental coldness the folly of her course, but she shut out the
thought with a slight shudder. Silence, to Dan Barry, had a louder
voice and more meaning than any words.</p>

<p>Then she knew that he was sitting up on the couch. Was he about
to stand up and walk out of the room? For moment after moment he
did not stir; and at length she knew, with a breathless certainty,
that he was staring fixedly at her! The hand which was farthest
from him, and hidden, she gripped hard upon the arm of the chair.
That was some comfort, some added strength.</p>

<p>She had now the same emotion she had had when Black Bart slunk
towards her under the tree&mdash;if a single perceptible tremor
shook her, if she showed the slightest awareness of the subtle
approach, she was undone. It was only her apparent unconsciousness
which could draw either the wolf-dog or the master.</p>

<p>She remembered what her father had told her of hunting young
deer&mdash;how he had lain in the grass and thrust up a leg above
the grass in sight of the deer and how they would first run away
but finally come back step by step, drawn by an invincible
curiosity, until at length they were within range for a point-blank
shot.</p>

<p>Now she must concentrate on the flames of the fireplace, see
nothing but them, think of nothing but the swiftly changing domes
and walls and pinnacles they made. She leaned a little forward and
rested her cheek upon her right hand&mdash;and thereby she shut out
the sight of Dan Barry effectually. Also it made a brace to keep
her from turning her head towards him, and she needed every
support, physical and mental.</p>

<p>Still he did not move. Was he in truth looking at her, or was he
staring beyond her at the grey sky which lowered past the window?
The faintest creaking sound told her that he had risen, slowly,
from the couch. Then not a sound, except that she knew, in some
mysterious manner, that he moved, but whether towards her or
towards the door she could not dream. But he stepped suddenly and
noiselessly into the range of her vision and sat down on a low
bench at one side of the hearth. If the strain had been tense
before, it now became terrible; for there he sat almost facing her,
and looking intently at her, yet she must keep all awareness of him
out of her eyes. In the excitement a strong pulse began to beat in
the hollow of her throat, as if her heart were rising. She had won,
she had kept him in the room, she had brought him to a keen thought
of her. A Pyrrhic victory, for she was poised on the very edge of a
cliff of hysteria. She began to feel a tremor of the hand which
supported her cheek. If that should become visible to him he would
instantly know that all her apparent unconsciousness was a sham,
and then she would have lost him truly!</p>

<p>Something sounded at one of the doors&mdash;and then the door
opened softly. She was almost glad of the interruption, for another
instant might have swept away the last reserve of her strength. So
this, then, was the end.</p>

<p>But the footfall which sounded in the apartment was a soft,
padding step, with a little scratching sound, light as a finger
running on a frosty window pane. And then a long, shaggy head
slipped close to Whistling Dan. It was Black Bart!</p>

<p>A wave of terror swept through her. She remembered another
scene, not many months before, when Black Bart had drawn his master
away from her and led him south, south, after the wild geese. The
wolf-dog had come again like a demoniac spirit to undo her
plans!</p>

<p>Only an instant&mdash;the crisis of a battle&mdash;then the
great beast turned slowly, faced her, slunk with his long stride
closer, and then a cold nose touched the hand which gripped the arm
of her chair. It gave her a welcome excuse for action of some sort;
she reached out her hand, slowly, and touched the forehead of Black
Bart. He winced back, and the long fangs flashed; her hand remained
tremulously poised in air, and then the long head approached again,
cautiously, and once more she touched it, and since it did not
stir, she trailed the tips of her fingers backwards towards the
ears. Black Bart snarled again, but it was a sound so subdued as to
be almost like the purring of a great cat. He sank down, and the
weight of his head came upon her feet. Victory!</p>

<p>In the full tide of conscious power she was able to drop her
hand from her face, raise her head, turn her glance carelessly upon
Dan Barry; she was met by ominously glowing eyes. Anger&mdash;at
least it was not indifference.</p>

<p>He rose and stepped in his noiseless way behind her, but he
reappeared instantly on the other side, and reached out his hand to
where her fingers trailed limp from the arm of the chair. There he
let them lie, white and cool, against the darkness of his palm. It
was as if he sought in the hand for the secret of her power over
the wolf-dog. She let her head rest against the back of the chair
and watched the nervous and sinewy hand upon which her own rested.
She had seen those hands fixed in the throat of Black Bart himself,
once upon a time. A grim simile came to her; the tips of her
fingers touched the paw of the panther. The steel-sharp claws were
sheathed, but suppose once they were bared, and clutched. Or she
stood touching a switch which might loose, by the slightest motion,
a terrific voltage. What would happen?</p>

<p>Nothing! Presently the hand released her fingers, and Dan Barry
stepped back and stood with folded arms, frowning at the fire. In
the weakness which overcame her, in the grip of the wild
excitement, she dared not stay near him longer. She rose and walked
into the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Serve breakfast now, Wung," she commanded, and at once the gong
was struck by the cook.</p>

<p>Before the long vibrations had died away the guests were
gathered around the table, and the noisy marshal was the first to
come. He slammed back a chair and sat down with a grunt of
expectancy.</p>

<p>"Mornin', Dan," he said, whetting his knife across the
table-cloth, "I hear you're ridin' this mornin'? Ain't going my
way, are you?"</p>

<p>Dan Barry sat frowning steadily down at the table. It was a
moment before he answered.</p>

<p>"I ain't leavin," he said softly, at length, "postponed my
trip."</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="chap33" name="chap33">33. DOCTOR BYRNE SHOWS THE
TRUTH</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">On this day of low-lying mists, this day so dull
that not a shadow was cast by tree or house or man, there was no
graver place than the room of old Joe Cumberland; even lamp light
was more merciful in the room, for it left the corners of the big
apartment in obscurity, but this meagre daylight stripped away all
illusion and left the room naked and ugly. Those colours of wall
and carpet, once brighter than spring, showed now as faded and
lifeless as foliage in the dead days of late November when the
leaves have no life except what keeps them clinging to the twig,
and when their fallen fellows are lifted and rustled on the ground
by every faint wind, with a sound like breathing in the forest. And
like autumn, too, was the face of Joe Cumberland, with a colour
neither flushed nor pale, but a dull sallow which foretells death.
Beside his bed sat Doctor Randall Byrne and kept the pressure of
two fingers upon the wrist of the rancher.</p>

<p>When he removed the thermometer from between the lips of
Cumberland the old man spoke, but without lifting his closed
eyelids, as if even this were an effort which he could only
accomplish by a great concentration of the will.</p>

<p>"No fever to-day, doc?"</p>

<p>"You feel a little better?" asked Byrne.</p>

<p>"They ain't no feelin'. But I ain't hot; jest sort of middlin'
cold."</p>

<p>Doctor Byrne glanced down at the thermometer with a frown, and
then shook down the mercury.</p>

<p>"No," he admitted, "there is no fever."</p>

<p>Joe Cumberland opened his eyes a trifle and peered up at
Byrne.</p>

<p>"You ain't satisfied, doc?"</p>

<p>Doctor Randall Byrne was of that merciless modern school which
believes in acquainting the patient with the truth.</p>

<p>"I am not," he said.</p>

<p>"H-m-m!" murmured the sick man. "And what might be wrong?"</p>

<p>"Your pulse is uneven and weak," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"I been feelin' sort of weak since I seen Dan last night,"
admitted the other. "But that news Kate brought me will bring me
up! She's kept him here, lad, think of that!"</p>

<p>"I am thinking of it," answered the doctor coldly. "Your last
interview with him nearly&mdash;killed you. If you see him again I
shall wash my hands of the case. When he first came you felt better
at once&mdash;in fact, I admit that you <i>seemed</i> to do better
both in body and mind. But the thing could not last. It was a false
stimulus, and when the first effects had passed away, it left you
in this condition. Mr. Cumberland, you must see him no more!"</p>

<p>But Joe Cumberland laughed long and softly.</p>

<p>"Life," he murmured, "ain't worth that much! Not half!"</p>

<p>"I can do no more than advise," said the doctor, as reserved as
before. "I cannot command."</p>

<p>"A bit peeved, doc?" queried the old man. "Well, sir, I know
they ain't much longer for me. Lord, man, I can feel myself going
out like a flame in a lamp when the oil runs up. I can feel life
jest makin' its last few jumps in me like the flame up the chimney.
But listen to me&mdash;" he reached out a long, large knuckled,
claw-like hand and drew the doctor down over him, and his eyes were
earnest&mdash;"I got to live till I see 'em standin' here beside
me, hand in hand, doc!"</p>

<p>The doctor, even by that dim light, had changed colour. He
passed his hand slowly across his forehead.</p>

<p>"You expect to see that?"</p>

<p>"I expect nothin'. I only hope!"</p>

<p>The bitterness of Byrne's heart came up in his throat.</p>

<p>"It will be an oddly suited match," he said, "if they marry. But
they will not marry."</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried Cumberland, and starting up in bed he braced himself
on a quaking elbow. "What's that?"</p>

<p>"Lie down!" ordered the doctor, and pressed the ranchman back
against the pillows.</p>

<p>"But what d'you mean?"</p>

<p>"It would be a long story&mdash;the scientific explanation."</p>

<p>"Doc, where Dan is concerned I got more patience than Job."</p>

<p>"In brief, then, I will prove to you that there is no mystery in
this Daniel Barry."</p>

<p>"If you can do that, doc, you're more of a man than I been
guessing you for. Start now!"</p>

<p>"In primitive times," said Doctor Randall Byrne, "man was nearly
related to what we now call the lower animals. In those days he
could not surround himself with an artificial protective
environment. He depended on the unassisted strength of his body.
His muscular and sensuous development, therefore, was far in
advance of that of the modern man. For modern man has used his mind
at the expense of his body. The very <i>quality</i> of his muscles
is altered; and the senses of sight and hearing, for instance, are
much blunted. For in the primitive days the ear kept guard over man
even when he slept in terror of a thousand deadly enemies, each
stronger than he; and the eye had to be keenly attuned to probe the
shadows of the forest for lurking foes.</p>

<p>"Now, sir, there is in biology the thing known as the sport. You
will have heard that all living organisms undergo gradual processes
of change. Season by season and year by year, environment affects
the individual; yet these gradual changes are extremely slow.
Between steps of noticeable change there elapse periods many times
longer than the life of historic man. All speed in changes such as
these comes in what we call 'sports'. That is, a particular plant,
for instance, gradually tends to have fewer leaves and a thicker
bark, but the change is slight from age to age until suddenly a
single instance occurs of plant which realises suddenly in a single
step the 'ideal' towards which the species has been striving. In a
word, it has very, very few leaves, and an extraordinarily thick
bark.</p>

<p>"For a particular instance, one species of orange tended to have
few and fewer seeds. But finally came an orange tree whose fruit
had no seeds at all. That was the origin of the navel orange. And
that was a typical 'sport'.</p>

<p>"Now, there is the reverse of the sport. Instead of jumping long
distance ahead, an individual may lapse back towards the primitive.
That individual is called an atavism. For instance, in this
mountain-desert there has, for several generations, been a pressure
of environment calling for a species of man which will be able to
live with comparative comfort in a waste region&mdash;a man, in a
word, equipped with such powerful organisms that he will be as much
at home in the heart of the desert as an ordinary man would be in a
drawing-room. You gather the drift of my argument.</p>

<p>"I have observed this man Barry carefully. I am thoroughly
convinced that he is such an atavism.</p>

<p>"Among other men he seems strange. He is different and therefore
he seems mysterious. As a matter of fact, he is quite a common
freak. I could name you others like him in differing from common
men, though not differing from them in exactly the same manner.</p>

<p>"You see the result of this? Daniel Barry is a man to whom the
desert is necessary, because he was made for the desert. He is
lonely among crowds&mdash;you have said it yourself&mdash;but he is
at home in a mountain wilderness with a horse and a dog."</p>

<p>"Doc, you talk well," broke in Joe Cumberland, "but if he ain't
human, why do humans like him so much? Why does he mean so much to
me&mdash;to Kate?"</p>

<p>"Simply because he is different. You get from him what you could
get from no other man in the world, perhaps, and you fail to see
that the fellow is really more akin to his wolf-dog than he is to a
man."</p>

<p>"Supposin' I said you was right," murmured the old man,
frowning, "how d'you explain why he likes other folks. According to
you, the desert and the mountains and animals is what he wants.
Then how is it that he took so much care of me when he come back
this time? How is it that he likes Kate, enough to give up a trail
of blood to stay here with her?"</p>

<p>"It is easy to explain the girl's attraction," said the doctor.
"All animals wish to mate, Mr. Cumberland, and an age-old instinct
is now working out in Dan Barry. But while you and Kate may please
him, you are not necessary to him. He left you once before and he
was quite happy in his desert. And I tell you, Mr. Cumberland, that
he will leave you again. You cannot tame the untameable. It is not
habit that rules this man. It is instinct a million years old. The
call which he will hear is the call of the wilderness, and to
answer it he will leave father and wife and children and ride out
with his horse and his dog!"</p>

<p>The old man lay quite motionless, staring at the ceiling.</p>

<p>"I don't want to believe you," he said slowly, "but before God I
think you're right. Oh, lad, why was I bound up in a tangle like
this one? And Kate&mdash;what will she do?"</p>

<p>The doctor was quivering with excitement.</p>

<p>"Let the man stay with her. In time she will come to see the
brute nature of Daniel Barry. That will be the end of him with
her."</p>

<p>"Brute. Doc. They ain't nobody as gentle as Dan!"</p>

<p>"Till he tastes blood, a lion can be raised like a house-dog,"
answered the doctor.</p>

<p>"Then she mustn't marry him? Ay, I've felt it&mdash;jest what
you've put in words. It's livin' death for Kate if she marries him!
She's kept him here to-day. To-morrow something may cross him, and
the minute he feels the pull of it, he'll be off on the
trail&mdash;the blow of a man, the hollering out of the wild
geese&mdash;God knows what it'll take to start him wild again and
forget us all&mdash;jest the way a child forgets its parents!"</p>

<p>A voice broke in upon them, calling far away: "Dan! Dan
Barry!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap34" name="chap34">34. THE ACID TEST</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">In the living-room below they heard it, Dan and
Kate Cumberland. All day she had sat by the fire which still blazed
on the hearth, replenished from time to time by the care of Wung
Lu. She had taken up some sewing, and she worked at it steadily.
Some of that time Dan Barry was in the room, sitting through long
intervals, watching her with lynx-eyed attention. Very rarely did
he speak&mdash;almost never, and she could have numbered upon her
two hands the words he had spoken&mdash;ay, and she could have
repeated them one by one. Now and again he rose and went out, and
the wolf-dog went with him each time. But towards the last Black
Bart preferred to stay in the room, crouched in front of her and
blinking at the fire, as if he knew that each time his master would
return to the fire. Then, why leave the pleasant warmth for the
chilly greyness of the day outside?</p>

<p>There he remained, stirring only now and then to lift a clumsy
paw and brush it across his eyes in an oddly human gesture. Once or
twice, also, he lifted that great, scarred head and laid it on her
knees, looking curiously from her busy hands to her face, and from
her face back again to her work, until, having apparently assured
himself that all was well, he dropped his head again and lay once
more motionless. She could see him open a listless eye when the
master entered the room again. And with each coming of Dan Barry
she felt again surrounded as if by invisible arms. Something was
prying at her, striving to win a secret from her.</p>

<p>As the day wore on, a great, singing happiness rose in her
throat, and at about the same time she heard a faint sound,
impalpable, from the farther side of the room where Dan Barry sat.
He was whistling.</p>

<p>A simple thing for a man to do, to be sure, but the astonishment
of it nearly stopped the heart of Kate Cumberland. For in all her
life she had never before heard him whistle except when he was in
the open, and preferably when he was astride of the strength and
the speed of Satan, with Black Bart scouting swiftly and smoothly
ahead. But now he whistled here by the warmth of the fire. To be
sure the sound was small and thin, but there was such music in it
as she had never heard before. It was so thin that it was almost
ghostly, as if the soul of wild Paganini played here on a muted
violin. No tune that might be repeated, but as always when she
heard it, a picture rose before the eyes of Kate. It wavered at
first against the yellow glow of the firelight. Then it quite shut
out all else.</p>

<p>It was deep night, starry night. The black horse and his rider
wound up a deep ravine. To one side a bold mountain tumbled up to
an infinite height, bristling with misshapen trees here and there,
and losing its head against the very stars. On the other side were
jagged hills, all carved in the solid rock. And down the valley,
between the mountains and the stars, blew a soft wind; as if that
wind made the music. They were climbing up, up, up, and now they
reach&mdash;the music rising also to a soft but triumphant
outburst&mdash;a high plateau. They were pressed up against the
heart of the sky. The stars burned low, and low. Around them the
whole earth seemed in prospect at their feet. The moon burst
through a mass of clouds, and she saw, far off, a great river
running silver through the night.</p>

<p>Happy? Ay, and he was happy too, and his happiness was one with
hers. He was not even looking out the window while he whistled, but
his eyes were fixed steadily, unchangingly, upon her face.</p>

<p>It was then that they heard it: "Dan! Dan Barry! Come out!"</p>

<p>A hoarse, ringing cry, as of one who is shouting against a great
wind: "Dan! Dan Barry! Come out!"</p>

<p>Dan Barry was on his feet and gliding to the wall, where he took
down his belt from a nail and buckled it swiftly around him. And
Kate ran to the window with the wolf-dog snarling beside her and
saw standing in front of the house, his hat off, his black hair
wildly tumbled, and two guns in his hands, Buck Daniels! Behind him
the tall bay mare shook with her panting and glistened with the
sweat of the long ride.</p>

<p>She heard a scratching next and saw the wolf-dog rear up and paw
at the door. Once through that door and he would be at the throat
of the man outside, she knew. Nor he alone, for Dan Barry was
coming swiftly across the room with that strange, padding step. He
had no eye for her. He was smiling, and she had rather have seen
him in a cursing fury than to see this smile. It curled the upper
lip with something like a sneer; and she caught the white glint of
his teeth; the wolf-dog snarled back over his shoulder to hurry his
master. It was the crisis which she had known all day was coming,
sooner or later. She had only prayed that it might be delayed for a
little time. And confronting the danger was like stepping into the
path of runaway horses. Fear ruled her with an iron hand, and she
swayed back against the wall and supported herself with an
outstretched hand.</p>

<p>What was there to be done? If she stepped in between him and his
man, he would brush her aside from his path and out of his life
forever. If he went on to his vengeance he would no less be started
on the path which led around the world away from her. The law would
be the hound which pursued him and relentlessly nipped at his
heels&mdash;an eternal terror and unrest. No thought of Buck
Daniels who had done so much for her. She cast his services out of
her mind with the natural cruelty of woman. Her whole thought was,
selfishly, for the man before her, and for herself.</p>

<p>He was there&mdash;his hand was upon the knob of the door. And
then she remembered how the teeth of Black Bart had closed over her
arm&mdash;and how they had not broken even the skin. In an instant
she was pressed against the door before Dan Barry&mdash;her arms
outstretched.</p>

<p>He fell back the slightest bit before her, and then he came
again and brushed her slowly, gently, to one side, with an
irresistible strength. She had to meet his eyes now&mdash;there was
no help for it&mdash;and she saw there that swirl of yellow
light&mdash;that insatiable hunger. And she knew, fully and
bitterly, that she had failed. With the wolf-dog, indeed, she had
conquered, but the man escaped her. If time had been granted her
she would have won, she knew, but the hand of Buck Daniels, so long
her ally, had destroyed her chances. It was his hand now which
shook the knob of the door, and she turned with a sob of despair to
face the new danger.</p>

<p>In her wildest dreams she had never visioned Buck Daniels
transformed like this. She knew that in his past, as one of those
long-riders who roam the mountain-desert, their hand against the
hands of every man, Buck Daniels had been known and feared by the
strongest. But all she had seen of Buck Daniels had been gentleness
itself. Yet what faced her as the door flew wide was a nightmare
thing with haggard face and shadow-buried, glittering
eyes&mdash;unshaven, unkempt of hair, his shirt open at the throat,
his great hands clenched for the battle. The wolf-dog, at that
familiar sight, whined a low greeting, but with a glance at his
master knew that there was a change&mdash;the old alliance was
broken&mdash;so he bared his white teeth and changed his whine to a
snarl of hate.</p>

<p>Then a strange terror struck Kate Cumberland. She had never
dreamed that she could fear for Dan Barry at the hands of any man,
but now the desperate resolve which breathed from every line of
Buck Daniels, chilled her blood at the heart. She sprang back
before Dan Barry. Facing him, she saw that demoniac glitter of
yellow rising momently brighter in his eyes, and he was smiling. No
execration or loud voiced curse could have contained the distilled
malignancy of that smile. All this she caught in a single glimpse.
The next instant she had whirled and stood before Dan, shielding
him with outspread arms and facing Buck Daniels. The latter thrust
back into the holster the gun which he had drawn when he entered
the room.</p>

<p>"Stand away from him, Kate," he commanded, and his eyes went
past her to dwell on the face of Barry. "Stand away from him. It's
been comin' for a long time, and now it's here. Barry I'm takin' no
start on you. Stand away from the girl and pull your gun&mdash;and
I'll pump you full of lead."</p>

<p>The softest of soft voices murmured behind her: "I been waitin'
for you, Buck, days and days and days. I ain't never been so glad
to see anybody!"</p>

<p>And she felt Barry slip shadowlike to one side. She sprang in
front of him again with a wild cry.</p>

<p>"Buck!" she begged, "don't shoot!"</p>

<p>Laughter, ringing and unhuman, filled the throat of Buck
Daniels.</p>

<p>"Is it him you're beggin' for?" he sneered at her. "Is it him
you got your fears for? Ain't you got a word of pity for poor Buck
Daniels that sneaked off like a whipped puppy? Bah! Dan Barry, the
time is come. I been leadin' the life of a houn' dog for your sake.
But it's ended. Pull your gun and get out from behind the skirts of
that girl!"</p>

<p>As long as they faced each other with the challenge in their
eyes, nothing on earth could avert the fight, she knew, but if she
could delay them for one moment&mdash;she felt that swift moving
form behind her slipping away from behind her&mdash;she could
follow Barry's movements by the light in Daniels' eyes.</p>

<p>"Buck!" she cried, "for God's sake&mdash;for my sake turn away
from him&mdash;and&mdash;roll another cigarette!"</p>

<p>For she remembered the story&mdash;how Daniels had turned under
the very nose of danger and done this insane thing in the saloon at
Brownsville and in her despair she could think of no other
appeal.</p>

<p>It was the very strangeness of it that gave it point. Buck
Daniels turned on his heel.</p>

<p>"It's the last kindness I do you, Dan," he said, with his broad
back to them. "But before you die you got to know why I'm killin'
you. I'm going to roll one cigarette and smoke it and while I smoke
it I'm goin' to tell you the concentrated truth about your
worthless self and when I'm done smokin' I'm goin' to turn around
and drop you where you stand. D'ye hear?"</p>

<p>"They's no need of waitin'," answered the soft voice of Barry.
"Talkin' don't mean much."</p>

<p>But Kate Cumberland turned and faced him. He was fairly a-quiver
with eagerness and the hate welled and blazed and flickered in his
eyes; his face was pale&mdash;very pale&mdash;and it seemed to her
that she could make out in the pallor the print of the fingers of
Buck Daniels and that blow those many days before. And she feared
him as she had never feared him before&mdash;yet she blocked his
way still with the outspread arms.</p>

<p>They could hear the crinkle of the cigarette paper as Buck
rolled his smoke.</p>

<p>"No," said Buck, his voice suddenly altered to an almost casual
moderation, "talk don't mean nothin' to you. Talk is human, and
nothin' human means nothin' to you. But I got to tell you why you
ought to die, Barry.</p>

<p>"I started out this mornin' hatin' the ground you walked on, but
now I see that they ain't no use to hate you. Is they any use
hatin' a mountain-lion that kills calves? No, you don't hate it,
but you get a gun and trail it and shoot it down. And that's the
way with you."</p>

<p>They heard the scratch of his match.</p>

<p>"That's the way with you. I got my back to you right now because
if I looked you in the eye I couldn't let you live no more'n I
could let a mountain-lion live. I know you're faster with your gun
than I am and stronger than I am, and made to fight. But I know I'm
going to kill you. You've done your work&mdash;you've left hell on
all sides of you&mdash;it's your time to die. I know it! You been
lyin' like a snake in the rocks with your poison ready for any man
that walks past you. Now your poison is about used up."</p>

<p>He paused, and then when he spoke again there was a ring of
exultation in his voice: "I tell you, Dan, I don't fear you, and I
know that the bullet in this gun here on my hips is the one that's
goin' to tear your heart out. I <i>know</i> it!"</p>

<p>Something like a sob came from the lips of Dan Barry. His hands
moved out towards Buck Daniels as though he were plucking something
from the empty air.</p>

<p>"You've said enough," he said. "You said plenty. Now turn around
and fight!"</p>

<p>And Kate Cumberland stepped back, out of line of the two. She
knew that in what followed she could not play the part of the
protector or the delayer. Here they stood, hungry for battle, and
there was no power in her weak hands to separate them. She stood
far back and fumbled with her hands at the wall for support. She
tried to close her eyes, but the fascination of the horror forced
her to watch against her strongest will. And the chief part of that
dreadful suspense lay in the even, calm voice of Buck Daniels as he
went on: "I'll turn around and fight soon enough. But Kate asked me
to smoke another cigarette. I know what she means. She wants me to
leave you the way I done in the saloon that day. I ain't goin' to
leave, Dan. But I'm glad she asked me to turn away, because it
gives me a chance to tell you some things you got to know before
you go west.</p>

<p>"Dan, you been like a fire that burns every hand that touches
you." He inhaled a long breath of smoke and blew it up towards the
ceiling. "You've busted the heart of the friend that follered you;
you've busted the heart of the girl that loves you."</p>

<p>He paused again, for another long inhalation, and Kate
Cumberland, staring in fearful suspense, waiting for the instant
when Buck should at last turn and when the shots should explode,
saw that the yellow glow was now somewhat misted in the eyes of
Barry. He frowned, as one bewildered.</p>

<p>"Think of her, Dan!" went on Buck Daniels. "Think of her wasting
herself on a no-good houn' dog like you&mdash;a no-good wild
<i>wolf</i>! My God A'mighty, she might of made some good man
happy&mdash;some man with a soul and a heart&mdash;but instead of
that God sent you like a blast across her&mdash;you with your
damned soul of wind and your heart of stone! Think of it! When you
see what you been, Barry, I wonder you don't go out and take your
own gun and blow off your head."</p>

<p>"Buck," called Dan Barry, "so help me God, if you don't turn
your face to me&mdash;I'll shoot you through the back!"</p>

<p>"I knew," said the imperturbable Daniels, "that you'd come to
that in the end. You used to fight like a man, but now you're
followin' your instincts, and you fight like a huntin' wolf. Look
at the brute that's slinkin' up to me there! That's what you are.
You kill for the sake of killin'&mdash;like the beasts.</p>

<p>"If you was a man, could you treat me like you've done? Your
damned cold heart and your yaller eyes and all would of burned up
in the barn the other night&mdash;you and your wolf and your damned
hoss. Why didn't I let you burn? Because I was a fool. Because I
still thought they was something of the man in you. But I seen
afterwards what you was, and I rode off to get out of your
way&mdash;to keep your hands from gettin' red with my blood. And
then you plan on follerin' <i>me</i>&mdash;damn you!&mdash;on
follerin' me!</p>

<p>"So that, Dan, is why I've come to put you out of the
world&mdash;as I'm goin' to do now! Once you hated to give pain,
and if you hurt people it was because you couldn't help it. But now
you live on torturin' others. Barry, pull your gun!"</p>

<p>And as he spoke, he whirled, the heavy revolver leaping into his
hand.</p>

<p>Still Kate Cumberland could not close her eyes on the horror.
She could not even cry out; she was frozen.</p>

<p>But there was no report&mdash;no spurt of smoke&mdash;no form of
a man stumbling blindly towards death. Dan Barry stood with one
hand pressed over his eyes and the other dangled at his side,
harmless, while he frowned in bewilderment at the floor.</p>

<p>He said slowly, at length: "Buck, I kind of think you're right.
They ain't no use in me. I been rememberin', Buck, how you sent
Kate to me when I was sick."</p>

<p>There was a loud clatter; the revolver dropped from the hand of
Buck Daniels.</p>

<p>The musical voice of Dan Barry murmured again: "And I remember
how you stood up to Jim Silent, for my sake. Buck, what's come
between us since them days? You hit me a while back, and since then
I been wantin' your blood&mdash;but hearin' you talk now,
somehow&mdash;I feel sort of lost and lonesome&mdash;like I'd
thrown somethin' away that I valued most."</p>

<p>Buck Daniels threw out his great arms and his voice was broken
terribly.</p>

<p>"Oh, God A'mighty, Dan," he cried, "jest take one step back to
me and I'll come all the way around the world to meet you!"</p>

<p>He stumbled across the floor and grasped at the hand of Barry,
for a mist had half-blinded his eyes.</p>

<p>"Dan," he pleaded, "ain't things as they once was? D'you forgive
me?"</p>

<p>"Why, Buck," murmured Dan Barry, in that same bewildered
fashion, "seems like we was bunkies once."</p>

<p>"Dan," muttered Buck Daniels, choking, "Dan&mdash;" but he dared
not trust his voice further, and turning, he fairly fled from the
room.</p>

<p>The dazed eyes of Dan Barry followed him. Then they moved until
they encountered the face of Kate Cumberland. A shock, as if of
surprise, widened the lids. For a long moment they stared in
silence, and then he began to walk, very slowly, a step at a time,
towards the girl. Now, as he faced her, she saw that there was no
longer a hint of the yellow in his eyes, but he stepped closer and
closer; he was right before her, watching her with an expression of
mute suffering that made her heart grow large.</p>

<p>He said, more to himself than to her: "Seems like I been away a
long time."</p>

<p>"A very long time," she whispered.</p>

<p>He drew a great breath.</p>

<p>"Is it true, what Buck said? About you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, my dear!" she cried. "Don't you see?"</p>

<p>He started a little, and taking both her hands he made her face
the dull light from the windows.</p>

<p>"Seems like you're kind of pale, Kate."</p>

<p>"The colour went while I waited for you, Dan."</p>

<p>"But there comes a touch of red&mdash;like morning&mdash;in your
throat, and runnin' up your cheeks."</p>

<p>"Don't you see? It's because you've come back!"</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and murmured: "I remember we was
close&mdash;closer than this. We were sittin' here&mdash;in this
room&mdash;by a fire. And then something called me out and I
follered it."</p>

<p>"The wild geese&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Wild geese?" he repeated blankly, and then shook his head. "How
could wild geese call me? But things happened. I was kept away.
Sometimes I wanted to come back to you, but somehow I could never
get started. Was it ten years ago that I left?"</p>

<p>"Months&mdash;months longer than years."</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked. "I been watchin' you, and waitin' to
find out what was different in you. Black Bart seen something in
you. I dunno what. Today I sort of guessed what it is. I can feel
it now. It's something like a pain. It starts sort of in the
stomach, Kate. It's like bein' away from a place where you want to
be. Queer, ain't it? I ain't far from you. I've got your hands in
mine, but somehow you don't feel near. I want to walk&mdash;a long
ways&mdash;closer. And the pain keeps growin'."</p>

<p>His voice fell away to a murmur, and now a deadly silence lay
between them, and it seemed as if lights were varying upon their
faces, so swift and subtle were the changes of expression. And they
drew closer by imperceptible degrees. So his arms, fumbling, found
their away about her, drew her closer, till her head drooped back,
and her face was close beneath his.</p>

<p>"Was it true," he whispered, "what Buck said?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing true except that we're together."</p>

<p>"But your eyes are brimful of tears!"</p>

<p>"The same pain you feel, Dan; the same loneliness and the
hurt."</p>

<p>"But it's going now. I feel as if I'd been riding three days
without more'n enough water to moisten my tongue every hour; with
the sand white hot, and my hoss staggerin', and the sun droppin'
closer and closer till the mountains are touched with white fire.
Then I come, in the evenin', to a valley with cool shadows
beginning to slip across from the western side, and I stand in the
shadow and feel the red-hot blood go smashin', smashin', smashin'
in my temples&mdash;and then&mdash;a sound of runnin' water
somewhere up the hill-side. Runnin', cool, fresh, sparkling water
whispering over the rocks. Ah, God, that's what it means to me to
stand here close to you, Kate!</p>

<p>"And it's like standin' up in the mornin' on the top of a high
hill and seein' the light jump up quick in the east, and there lies
all the world at my feet, mile after mile of it&mdash;they's a
river like silver away off yonder&mdash;and they's range after
range walkin' off into a blue nothing. That's what it's like to
stand here and look down into them blue eyes of yours,
Kate&mdash;miles and miles into 'em, till I feel as if I seen your
heart beneath. And they's the rose of the mornin' on your cheeks,
and the breath of the mornin' stirrin' between your lips, and the
light of the risin' sun comes flarin' in your eyes. And I own the
world&mdash;I own the world.'</p>

<p>"Two burnin' pieces of wood, that's you and me, and when I was
away from you the fire went down to a smoulder; but now that we're
close a wind hits us, and the flames come together and rise and
jump and twine together. Two pieces of burnin' wood, but only one
flame&mdash;d'you feel it?&mdash;Oh, Kate, our bodies is ashes and
dust, and all that's worth while is that flame blowin' up from us,
settin' the world on fire!"</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="chap35" name="chap35">35. PALE ANNIE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Even in Elkhead there were fires this day. In the
Gilead saloon one might have thought that the liquid heat which the
men imbibed would serve in place of stoves, but the proprietor,
"Pale Annie," had an eye to form, and when the sky was grey he
always lighted the stove.</p>

<p>"Pale Annie" he was called because his real name was Anderson
Hawberry Sandringham. That name had been a great aid to him when he
was an undertaker in Kansas City; but Anderson Hawberry Sandringham
had fallen from the straight and narrow path of good undertakers
some years before and he had sought refuge in the mountain-desert,
where most things prosper except sheriffs and grass. He was fully
six inches more than six feet in height and his face was so long
and pale that even Haw-Haw Langley seemed cheerful beside the
ex-undertaker. In Kansas City this had been much prized, for that
single face could lend solemnity to any funeral. In Elkhead it was
hardly less of an asset.</p>

<p>People came out of curiosity to see Pale Annie behind the bar
with his tall silk hat&mdash;which he could never bring himself to
lay aside&mdash;among the cobwebs of the rafters. They came out of
curiosity and they remained to drink&mdash;which is a habit in the
mountain-desert. A travelling drummer or a patent medicine man had
offered Pale Annie a handsome stake to simply go about with him and
lend the sanction of his face to the talk of the drummer, but Pale
Annie had discovered a veritable philosopher's stone in Elkhead and
he was literally turning whiskey into gold.</p>

<p>This day was even more prosperous than usual for Pale Annie, for
the grey weather and the chilly air made men glad of the warmth,
both external and internal, which Pale Annie possessed in his
barroom. His dextrous hands were never for a moment still at the
bar, either setting out drinks or making change, except when he
walked out and threw a fresh feed into the fire, and stirred up the
ruddy depths of the stove with a tall poker. It was so long,
indeed, that it might have served even Pale Annie for a cane and it
was a plain untapered bar of iron which the blacksmith had given
him as the price of a drink, on a day. He needed a large poker,
however, for there was only the one stove in the entire big room,
and it was a giant of its kind, as capacious as a hogshead. This
day Pale Annie kept it red hot, so that the warmth might penetrate
to the door on the one hand and to the rear of the room where the
tables and chairs were, on the other.</p>

<p>Since Pale Annie's crowd took little exercise except for bending
their elbows now and again, and since the majority of them had been
in the place fully half the day, by ten in the evening sounds of
hilarity began to rise from the saloon. Solemn-faced men who had
remained in their places for hour after hour, industriously putting
away the red-eye, now showed symptoms of life. Some of them
discovered hitherto hidden talents as singers, and they would rise
from their places, remove their hats, open their bearded mouths,
and burst into song. An antiquarian who had washed gold in '49 and
done nothing the rest of his life save grow a prodigious set of
pure white whiskers, sprang from his place and did a hoe-down that
ravished the beholders. Thrice he was compelled to return to the
floor, and in the end his performance was only stopped by an attack
of sciatica. Two strong men carried him back to his chair and wept
over him, and there was another drink all around.</p>

<p>In this scene of universal joy there were two places of shadow.
For at the rear end of the room, almost out of reach of the
lantern-light, sat Haw-Haw Langley and Mac Strann. The more Haw-Haw
Langley drank the more cadaverous grew his face, until in the end
it was almost as solemn as that of Pale Annie himself; as for Mac
Strann, he seldom drank at all.</p>

<p>A full hour had just elapsed since either of them spoke, yet
Haw-Haw Langley said, as if in answer to a remark: "He's heard too
much about you, Mac. He ain't no such fool as to come to
Elkhead."</p>

<p>"He ain't had time," answered the giant.</p>

<p>"Ain't had time? All these days?"</p>

<p>"Wait till the dog gets well. He'll follow the dog to
Elkhead."</p>

<p>"Why, Mac, the trail's been washed out long ago. That wind the
other day would of knocked out any trail less'n a big waggon."</p>

<p>"It won't wash out the trail for <i>that</i> dog," said Mac
Strann calmly.</p>

<p>"Well," snarled Haw-Haw, "I got to be gettin' back home pretty
soon. I ain't rollin' in coin the way you are, Mac."</p>

<p>The other returned no answer, but let his eyes rove vacantly
over the room, and since his head was turned the other way, Haw-Haw
Langley allowed a sneer to twist at his lips for a moment.</p>

<p>"If I had the price," he said, "we'd have another drink."</p>

<p>"I ain't drinkin'," answered the giant monotonously.</p>

<p>"Then I'll go up and bum one off'n Pale Annie. About time he
come through with a little charity."</p>

<p>So he unfurled his length and stalked through the crowd up to
the bar. Here he leaned and confidentially whispered in the ear of
Pale Annie.</p>

<p>"Partner, I been sprinklin' dust for a long time in here, and
there ain't been any reward. I'm dry, Annie."</p>

<p>Pale Annie regarded him with grave disapproval.</p>

<p>"My friend," he said solemnly, "liquor is the real root of all
evil. For my part, I quench my thirst with water. They's a tub over
there in the corner with a dipper handy. Don't mention it."</p>

<p>"I didn't thank you," said Haw-Haw Langley furiously. "Damn a
tight-wad, say I!"</p>

<p>The long hand of Pale Annie curled affectionately around the
neck of an empty bottle.</p>

<p>"I didn't quite gather what you said?" he remarked courteously,
and leaned across the bar&mdash;within striking distance.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you later," remarked Haw-Haw sullenly, and turned his
shoulder to the bar.</p>

<p>As he did so two comparatively recent arrivals came up beside
him. They were fresh from a couple of months of range-finding, and
they had been quenching a concentrated thirst by concentrated
effort. Haw-Haw Langley looked them over, sighed with relief, and
then instantly produced Durham and the brown papers. He paused in
the midst of rolling his cigarette and offered them to the nearest
fellow.</p>

<p>"Smoke?" he asked.</p>

<p>Now a man of the mountain-desert knows a great many things, but
he does not know how to refuse. The proffer of a gift embarrasses
him, but he knows no way of avoiding it; also he never rests easy
until he has made some return.</p>

<p>"Sure," said the man, and gathered in the tobacco and papers.
"Thanks!"</p>

<p>He covertly dropped the cigarette which he had just lighted, and
stepped on it, then he rolled another from Haw-Haw's materials. The
while, he kept an uneasy eye on his new companion.</p>

<p>"Drinkin'?" he asked at length.</p>

<p>"Not jest now," said Haw-Haw carelessly.</p>

<p>"Always got room for another," protested the other, still more
in earnest as he saw his chance of a return disappearing.</p>

<p>"All right, then," said Haw-Haw. "Jest one more."</p>

<p>And he poured a glass to the brim, waved it gracefully towards
the others without spilling a drop, and downed it at a gulp.</p>

<p>"Been in town long?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not long enough to find any action," answered the other.</p>

<p>The eye of Haw-Haw Langley brightened. He looked over the two
carefully. The one had black hair and the other red, but they were
obviously brothers, both tall, thick-shouldered, square-jawed, and
pug-nosed. There was Irish blood in that twain; the fire in their
eyes could have come from only one place on earth. And Haw-Haw
grinned and looked down the length of the room to where Mac Strann
sat, a heavy, inert mass, his fleshy forehead puckered into a
half-frown of animal wistfulness.</p>

<p>"You ain't the only ones," he said to his companion at the bar.
"They's a man in town who says they don't turn out any two men in
this range that could give him action."</p>

<p>"The hell!" grunted he of the red hair. And he looked down to
his blunt-knuckled hands.</p>

<p>"'S matter of fact," continued Haw-Haw easily, "he's right here
now!"</p>

<p>He looked again towards Mac Strann and remembered once more the
drink which Mac might so easily have purchased for him.</p>

<p>"It ain't Pale Annie, is it?" asked the black-haired man,
casting a dubious glance up and down the vast frame of the
undertaker.</p>

<p>"Him? Not half!" grinned Haw-Haw. "It's a fet feller down to the
end of the bar. I guess he's been drinkin' some. Kind of off his
nut."</p>

<p>He indicated Mac Strann.</p>

<p>"He looks to me," said the red-haired man, setting his jaw,
"like a feller that ain't any too old to learn one more thing about
the range in these parts."</p>

<p>"He looks to me," chimed in the black haired brother, "like a
feller that might be taught something right here in Pale Annie's
barroom. Anyway, he's got room at his table for two more."</p>

<p>So saying the two swallowed their drinks and rumbled casually
down the length of the room until they came to the table where Mac
Strann sat. Haw-Haw Langley followed at a discreet distance and
came within earshot to hear the deep voice of Mac Strann rumbling:
"Sorry, gents, but that chair is took."</p>

<p>The black-haired man sank into the indicated chair.</p>

<p>"You're right," he announced calmly. "Anybody could see with
half an eye that you ain't a fool. It's took by me!"</p>

<p>And he grinned impudently in the face of Mac Strann. The latter,
who had been sitting with slightly bent head, now raised it and
looked the pair over carelessly; there was in his eye the same dumb
curiosity which Haw-Haw Langley had seen many a time in the eye of
a bull, leader of the herd.</p>

<p>The giant explained carefully: "I mean, they's a friend of mine
that's been sittin' in that chair."</p>

<p>"If I ain't your friend," answered the black-haired brother
instantly, "it ain't any fault of mine. Lay it up to yourself,
partner!"</p>

<p>Mac Strann stretched out his hand on the surface of the
table.</p>

<p>He said: "I got an idea you better get out of that chair."</p>

<p>The other turned his head slowly on all sides and then looked
Mac Strann full in the face.</p>

<p>"Maybe they's something wrong with my eyes," he said, "but I
don't see no reason."</p>

<p>The little dialogue had lasted long enough to focus all eyes on
the table at the end of the room, and therefore there were many
witnesses to what followed. The arm of Mac Strann shot out; his
hand fastened in the collar of the black-haired man's shirt, and
the latter was raised from his seat and propelled to one side by a
convulsive jerk. He probably would have been sent crashing into the
bar had not his shirt failed under the strain. It ripped in two at
the shoulders, and the seeker after action, naked to the waist,
went reeling back to the middle of the room, before he gained his
balance. After him went Mac Strann with an agility astonishing in
that squat, formless bulk. His long arms were outstretched and his
fingers tensed, and in his face there was an uncanny joy; his lip
had lifted in that peculiarly disheartening sneer.</p>

<p>He was not a pace from him of the black hair when a yell of rage
sounded behind him, and the other brother leaped through the air
and landed on Mac Strann's back. He doubled up, slipped his arms
behind him, and the next instant, without visible reason, the
red-headed man hurtled through the air and smashed against the bar
with a jolt that set the glassware shivering and singing. Then he
relaxed on the floor, a twisted and foolish looking mass.</p>

<p>As for the seeker after action, he had at first reached after
his revolver, but he changed his mind at the last instant and
instead picked up the great poker which leaned against the stove.
It was a ponderous weapon and he had to wield it in both hands. As
he swung it around his head there was a yell from men ducking out
of the way, and Pale Annie curled his hand again around his
favorite empty bottle. He had no good opportunity to demonstrate
its efficiency, however. Mac Strann, crouching in the position from
which he had catapulted the red-haired man, cast upwards a single
glance at the other brother, and then he sprang in. The poker
hissed through the air with the vigour of a strong man's arms
behind it and it would have cracked the head of Mac Strann like an
empty egg-shell if it had hit its mark. But it was heaved too high,
and Mac Strann went in like a football player rushing the line,
almost doubled up against the floor as he ran. His shoulders struck
the other hardly higher than the knees, and they went down
together, but so doing the head of Mac Strann's victim cracked
against the floor, and he also was still.</p>

<p>The exploit was greeted by a yell of applause and then someone
proposed a cheer, and it was given. It died off short on the lips
of the applauders, however, for it was seen that Mac Strann was not
yet done with his work, and he went about it in a manner which made
men sober suddenly and exchange glances.</p>

<p>First the stranger dragged the two brothers together, laying one
of them face down on the floor. The second he placed over the
first, back to back. Next he picked up the long poker from the
floor and slipped it under the head and down to the neck of the
first man. The bystanders watched in utter silence, with a touch of
horror coming now in their eyes.</p>

<p>Now Mac Strann caught the ends of the iron and began to twist up
on them. There was no result at first. He refreshed his hold and
tried again. The sleeves of his shirt were seen to swell and then
grow hard and taut with vast play of muscle beneath. His head bowed
lower between his shoulders, and those shoulders trembled, and the
muscles over them quivered like heat-waves rising of a spring
morning. There was a creaking, now, and then the iron was seen to
shiver and then bend, slowly, and once it was wrenched out of the
horizontal, the motion was more and more rapid. Until, when the
giant was done with his labor, the ends of the iron over-lapped
around the necks of the two luckless brothers. Mac Strann stepped
back and surveyed his work; the rest of the room was in silence,
saving that the red-headed man was coming back to consciousness and
now writhed and groaned feebly. He could not rise; that was
manifest, for the thick band of iron tied his neck to the neck of
his brother.</p>

<p>Upon this scene Mac Strann gazed with a thoughtful air and then
stepped to the side of the room where stood a bucket of dirty
water, recently used for mopping behind the bar. This he caught up,
returned, and dashed the black, greasy water over the pair.</p>

<p>If it had been electricity it could not have operated more
effectively. The two awoke with one mind, and with a tremendous
spluttering and cursing struggled to regain their feet. It was no
easy thing, however, for when one stood up the other slipped and in
his fall involved the brother. In the meantime it made a jest
exactly suited to the mind of Elkhead, and shrieks of hysterical
laughter rewarded their struggles. Until at length they sat
solemnly, back to back, easing the pressure of the iron as best
they might with their hands. Assembled Elkhead reeled about the
room, drunken with laughter. But Mac Strann went quietly back to
his table and paid no attention to the scene.</p>

<p>There is an end to all good things, however, and finally the two
brothers concerted action together, rose, and then side-stepped
towards the door, dripping the mop-water at every step. Obviously
they were bound for the blacksmith's to loose their collar, and
everyone in the saloon knew that the blacksmith was not in
town.</p>

<p>The old man who had done the hoe-down hobbled to the end of the
barroom and before the table of Mac Strann made a speech to the
effect that Elkhead had everything it needed except laughter, that
Mac Strann had come to their assistance in that respect, and that
if he, the old man, had the power, he would pension such an
efficient jester and keep him permanently in the town. To all of
this Mac Strann paid not the slightest heed, but with his fleshy
brow puckered considered the infinite distance. Even the drink
which Pale Annie, grateful for the averted riot, placed on the
table before him, Mac Strann allowed to stand untasted. And it was
private stock!</p>

<p>It was at this time that Haw-Haw Langley made his way back to
the table and occupied the contested seat.</p>

<p>"That was a bum play," he said solemnly to Mac Strann. "When
Barry hears about what you done here to two men, d'you think that
he'll ever hit your trail?"</p>

<p>The other started.</p>

<p>"I never thought about it," he murmured, his thick lips, as
always, framing speech with difficulty. "D'you s'pose I'd ought to
go back to the Cumberland place for him?"</p>

<p>A yell rose at the farther end of the room.</p>

<p>"A wolf! Hey! Shoot the damn wolf!"</p>

<p>"You fool!" cried another. "He ain't skinny enough to be a wolf.
Besides, whoever heard of a tame wolf comin' into a barroom?"</p>

<p>Nevertheless many a gun was held in readiness, and the men, even
the most drunken, fell back to one side and allowed a free passage
for the animal. It seemed, indeed, to be a wolf, and a giant of its
kind, and it slunk now with soundless step through the silence of
the barroom, glancing neither to right nor to left, until it came
before the table of Mac Strann. There it halted and slunk back a
little, the upper lip lifted away from the long fangs, its eyes
glittered upon the face of the giant, and then it swung about and
slipped out of the barroom as it had come, in utter silence.</p>

<p>In the utter silence Mac Strann leaned across the table to
Haw-Haw Langley.</p>

<p>"He's come alone this time," he said, "but the next time he'll
bring his master with him. We'll wait!"</p>

<p>The Adam's-apple rose and fell in the throat of Haw-Haw.</p>

<p>"We'll wait," he nodded, and he burst into the harsh, unhuman
laughter which had given him his name.</p>

<h2><a id="chap36" name="chap36">36. THE DISCOVERY OF LIFE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">This is the letter which Swinnerton Loughburne
received over the signature of Doctor Randall Byrne. It was such a
strange letter that between paragraphs Swinnerton Loughburne paced
up and down his Gramercy Park studio and stared, baffled, at the
heights of the Metropolitan Tower.</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear Swinnerton,<br>
<br>
"I'll be with you in good old Manhattan about as soon as you get
this letter. I'm sending this ahead because I want you to do me a
favour. If I have to go back to those bare, blank rooms of mine
with the smell of chemicals drifting in from the laboratory,
I'll&mdash;get drunk. That's all!"</p>

<p>Here Swinnerton Loughburne lowered the letter to his knees and
grasped his head in both hands. Next he turned to the end of the
letter and made sure that the signature was "Randall Byrne." He
stared again at the handwriting. It was not the usual script of the
young doctor. It was bolder, freer, and twice as large as usual;
there was a total lack of regard for the amount of stationery
consumed.</p>

<p>Shaking his head in bewilderment, Swinnerton Loughburne shook
his fine grey head and read on:</p>

<p class="letter">"What I want you to do, is to stir about and find
me a new apartment. Mind you, I don't want the loft of some
infernal Arcade building in the Sixties. Get me a place somewhere
between Thirtieth and Fifty-eighth. <i>Two</i> bed-rooms. I want a
place to put some of the boys when they drop around my way. And at
least one servant's room. Also at least one large room where I can
stir about and wave my arms without hitting the chandelier. Are you
with me?"</p>

<p>Here Swinnerton Loughburne seized his head between both hands
again and groaned: "Dementia! Plain and simple dementia! And at his
age, poor boy!"</p>

<p>He continued:</p>

<p class="letter">"Find an interior decorator. Not one of these
fuzzy haired women-in-pants, but a he-man who knows what a he-man
needs. Tell him I want that place furnished regardless of expense.
I want some deep chairs that will hit me under the knees. I want
some pictures on the wall&mdash;<i>but nothing out of the
Eighteenth Century</i>&mdash;no impressionistic landscapes&mdash;no
girls dolled up in fluffy stuff. I want some pictures I can enjoy,
even if my maiden aunt can't. There you are. Tell him to go ahead
on those lines.<br>
<br>
"In a word, Swinnerton, old top, I want to live. For about thirty
years I've <i>thought</i>, and now I know that there's nothing in
it. All the thinking in the world won't make one more blade of
grass grow; put one extra pound on the ribs of a long-horn; and in
a word, thinking is the bunk, pure and simple!"</p>

<p>At this point Swinnerton Loughburne staggered to the window,
threw it open, and leaned out into the cold night. After a time he
had strength enough to return to his chair and read through the
rest of the epistle without interruption.</p>

<p class="letter">"You wonder how I've reached the new viewpoint?
Simply by seeing some concentrated life here at the Cumberland
ranch. My theories are blasted and knocked in the head&mdash;praise
God!&mdash;and I've brushed a million cobwebs out of my brain.
Chemistry? Rot! There's another sort of chemistry that works on the
inside of a man. That's what I want to study. There are three great
preliminary essentials to the study:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1st: How to box with a man.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2nd: How to talk with a girl.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3rd: How to drink old wine.<br>
<br>
"Try the three, Swinnerton; they aren't half bad. At first they may
give you a sore jaw, an aching heart, and a spinning head, but in
the end they teach you how to keep your feet and <i>fight</i>!<br>
<br>
"This is how my eyes were opened.<br>
<br>
"When I came out to this ranch it was hard for me to ride a horse.
So I've been studying how it should be done. Among other things,
you should keep your toes turned in, you know. And there are many
other things to learn.<br>
<br>
"When I had mastered them one by one I went out the other day and
asked to have a horse saddled. It was done, and a lantern-jawed
cowpuncher brought out a piebald gelding with long ears and sleepy
eyes. Not a lovely beast, but a mild one. So I went into the saddle
according to theory&mdash;with some slight hesitations here and
there, planted my feet in the stirrups, and told the lantern-jawed
fellow to turn loose the head of the piebald. This was done. I
shook the reins. The horse did not move. I called to the brute by
name. One ear wagged back to listen to me.<br>
<br>
"I kicked the beast in the ribs. Unfortunately I had forgotten that
long spurs were on my heels. The horse was instantly aware of that
fact, however. He leaped into a full gallop. A very jolty process.
Then he stopped&mdash;but I kept on going. A fence was in the way,
so I was halted. Afterwards the lantern-jawed man picked me up and
offered to carry me back to the house or at least get a wheelbarrow
for me. I refused with some dignity. I remarked that I preferred
walking, really, and so I started out across the hills and away
from the house. My head was sore; so were my shoulders where I hit
the fence; I began to think of the joy of facing that horse again,
armed with a club.<br>
<br>
"It was evening&mdash;after supper, you see&mdash;and the light of
the moon was already brighter than the sunlight. And by the time I
had crossed the first range of hills, it was quite dark. As I
walked I brooded upon many things. There were enough to disturb
me.<br>
<br>
"There was old Joe Cumberland, at death's door and beyond the reach
of my knowledge; and he had been taken away from death by the wild
man, Dan Barry. There was the girl with the bright hair&mdash;Kate
Cumberland. In education, nothing; in brain, nothing; in
experience, nothing; and yet I was attracted. But she was not
attracted in the least until along came the wild man again, and
then she fell into his arms&mdash;actually fought for him! Why? I
could not tell. My name and the things I have done and even my
money, meant nothing to her. But when he came it was only a glance,
a word, a smile, and she was in his arms. I felt like Caligula. I
wished the world had only one neck, and I an axe. But why should I
have felt depressed because of failures in the eyes of these silly
yokels? Not one of them could read the simplest chemical
formula!<br>
<br>
"All very absurd, you will agree, and you may get some inkling as
to my state of mind while I walked over those same dark hills. I
seemed a part of that darkness. I looked up to the stars. They were
merely like the pages of a book. I named them off hand, one after
the other, and thought of their characteristics, their distances,
their composition, and meditated on the marvels the spectrum has
made known to us. But no sooner did such a train of thoughts start
in my brain, than I again recurred to the girl, Kate Cumberland,
and all I was aware of was a pain at heart&mdash;something like
homesickness. Very strange.<br>
<br>
"She and the man are together constantly. The other day I was in
Joseph Cumberland's room and we heard whistling outside. The face
of the old man lighted, 'They are together again,' he said. 'How do
you guess at that?' I asked. 'By the sound of his whistling,' he
answered. 'For he whistles as if he expected an answer&mdash;as if
he were talking with someone.' And by the Lord, the old man was
right. It would never have occurred to me!<br>
<br>
"Now as I started down the farther slope of a hill a whistling
sound ran upon me through the wind, and looking back I saw a
horseman galloping with great swiftness along the line of the
crest, very plainly outlined by the sky, and by something of
smoothness in the running of the horse I knew that it was Barry and
his black stallion. But the whistling&mdash;the music! Dear God,
man, have you read of the pipes of Pan? That night I heard them and
it made a riot in my heart.<br>
<br>
"He was gone, suddenly, and the whistling went out like a light,
but something had happened inside me&mdash;the first beginning of
this process of internal change. The ground no longer seemed so
dark. There were earth smells&mdash;very friendly&mdash;I heard
some little creature chirruping contentedly to itself. Something
hummed&mdash;a grasshopper, perhaps. And then I looked up to the
stars. There was not a name I could think of&mdash;I forgot them
all, and for the first time I was contented to look at them and
wonder at their beauty without an attempt at analysis or
labelling.<br>
<br>
"If I say that I went back to the ranch-house with my feet on the
ground and my heart up there among the stars, will you
understand?<br>
<br>
"I found the girl sewing in front of the fire in the living room.
Simply looked up to me with a smile, and a certain dimness about
the eyes&mdash;well, my breath stopped.<br>
<br>
"'Kate,' said I, 'I am going away to-morrow morning!'<br>
<br>
"'And leave Dad?' said she.<br>
<br>
"'To tell you the truth,' I answered, 'there is nothing I can do
for him. There has never been anything I could do for him.'<br>
<br>
"'I am sorry,' said she, and lifted up her eyes to me.<br>
<br>
"Now, I had begun by being stiff with her, but the ringing of that
whistling&mdash;pipes of Pan, you know&mdash;was in my ears. I took
a chair beside her. Something overflowed in my heart. For the first
time in whole days I could look on her beauty without pain.<br>
<br>
"'Do you know why I'm going?' I asked.<br>
<br>
"She waited.<br>
<br>
"'Because,' said I, and smiled right into her face, 'I love you,
Kate, most infernally; and I know perfectly well that I will get
never the devil a bit of good out of it.'<br>
<br>
"She peered at me. 'You aren't jesting?' says she. 'No, you're
serious. I'm very sorry, Doctor Byrne.'<br>
<br>
"'And I,' I answered, 'am glad. I wouldn't change it for the world.
For once in my life&mdash;to-night&mdash;I've forgotten myself. No,
I won't go away and nurse a broken heart, but I'll think of you as
a man should think of something bright and above him. You'll keep
my heart warm, Kate, till I'm a very old man. Because of you, I'll
be able to love some other girl&mdash;and a fine one, by the
Lord!'<br>
<br>
"Something in the nature of an outburst, eh? But it was the music
which had done it. All the time it rang and echoed through my ears.
My words were only an echo of it. I was in tune with the universe.
I was living for the first time. The girl dropped her
sewing&mdash;tossed it aside. She came over to me and took my hands
in a way that would have warmed even the icicles of your heart,
Swinnerton.<br>
<br>
"'Doctor,' says she, 'I know that you are going to be very
happy.'<br>
<br>
"'Happiness,' said I, 'is a trick, like riding a horse. And I think
that I've learned the trick. I've caught it from you and from
Barry.'<br>
<br>
"At that, she let go my hands and stepped back. The very devil is
in these women, Swinnerton. You never can place them for a minute
at a time.<br>
<br>
"'I am trying to learn myself,' she said, and there was a shadow of
wistfulness in her eyes.<br>
<br>
"In another moment I should have made a complete fool of myself,
but I remembered in time and got out of the room. To-morrow I start
back for the old world but I warn you beforehand, my dear fellow,
that I'm bringing something of the new world with me.<br>
<br>
"What has it all brought to me? I am sad one day and gay the next.
But at least I know that thinking is not life and now I'm ready to
fight.<br>
<br>
"Randall Byrne."</p>

<h2><a id="chap37" name="chap37">37. THE PIEBALD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The morning of the doctor's departure witnessed
quite a ceremony at the Cumberland ranch, for old Joe Cumberland
insisted that he be brought down from his room to his old place in
the living-room. When he attempted to rise from his bed, however,
he found that he could not stand; and big Buck Daniels lifted the
old man like a child and carried him down the stairs. Once
ensconced on the sofa in the living-room Joe Cumberland beckoned
his daughter close to him, and whispered with a smile as she leaned
over: "Here's what comes of pretendin', Kate. I been pretending to
be too sick to walk, and now I <i>can't</i> walk; and if I'd
pretended to be well, I'd be ridin' Satan right now!"</p>

<p>He looked about him.</p>

<p>"Where's Dan?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Upstairs getting ready for the trip."</p>

<p>"Trip?"</p>

<p>"He's riding with Doctor Byrne to town and he'll bring back
Doctor Byrne's horse."</p>

<p>The old man grew instantly anxious.</p>

<p>"They's a lot of things can happen on a long trip like that,
Kate."</p>

<p>She nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"But we have to try him," she said. "We can't keep him here at
the ranch all the time. And if he really cares, Dad, he'll come
back."</p>

<p>"And you let him go of your own free will?" asked Joe
Cumberland, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"I asked him to go," she answered quietly, but some of the
colour left her face.</p>

<p>"Of course it's going to come out all right," nodded her
father.</p>

<p>"I asked him when he'd be back, and he said he would be here by
dark to-night."</p>

<p>The old man sighed with relief.</p>

<p>"He don't never slip up on promises," he said. "But oh, lass,
I'll be glad when he's back again! Buck, how'd you and Dan come
along together?"</p>

<p>"We don't come," answered Buck gloomily. "I tried to shake hands
with him yesterday and call it quits. But he wouldn't touch me. He
jest leaned back and smiled at me and hated me with his eyes, that
way he has. He don't even look at me except when he has to, and
when he does I feel like someone was sneaking up behind me with a
knife ready. And he ain't said ten words to me since I come back."
He paused and considered Kate with the same dark, lowering glance.
"To-morrow I leave."</p>

<p>"You'll think better of that," nodded Joe Cumberland. "Here's
the doctor now."</p>

<p>He came in with Dan Barry behind him. A changed man was the
doctor. He was a good two inches taller because he stood so much
more erect, and there was a little spring in his step which gave
aspiration and spirit to his carriage. He bade them good-bye one by
one, and by Joe Cumberland he sat down for an instant and wished
him luck. The old ranchman drew the other down closer.</p>

<p>"They's no luck for me," he whispered, "but don't tell none of
'em. I'm about to take a longer trip than you'll ride to-day. But
first I'll see 'em settled down here&mdash;Dan quiet and both of
'em happy. S'long, doc&mdash;thanks for takin' care of me. But this
here is something that can't be beat no way. Too many years'll
break the back of any man, doc. Luck to ye!"</p>

<p>"If you'll step to the door," said the doctor, smiling upon the
rest, "you'll have some fun to watch. I'm going to ride on the
piebald."</p>

<p>"Him that throwed you yesterday?" grinned Buck Daniels.</p>

<p>"The same," said the doctor. "I think I can come to a
gentleman's understanding with him. A gentleman from the piebald's
point of view is one who is never unintentionally rude. He may
change his mind this morning&mdash;or he may break my back. One of
the two is sure to happen."</p>

<p>In front of the house Dan Barry already sat on Satan with Black
Bart sitting nearby watching the face of his master. And beside
them the lantern-jawed cowpuncher held the bridle of the piebald
mustang. Never in the world was there a lazier appearing beast. His
lower lip hung pendulous, a full inch and a half below the upper.
His eyes were rolled so that hardly more than the whites showed. He
seemed to stand asleep, dreaming of some Nirvana for equine souls.
And the only signs of life were the long ears, which wobbled,
occasionally, back and forth.</p>

<p>When the doctor mounted, the piebald limited all signs of
interest to opening one eye.</p>

<p>The doctor clucked. The piebald switched his tail. Satan, at a
word from Dan Barry, moved gracefully into a soft trot away from
the house. The doctor slapped his mount on the neck. An ear flicked
back and forth. The doctor stretched out both legs, and then he dug
both spurs deep into the flanks of the mustang.</p>

<p>It was a perfectly successful maneuvre. The back of the piebald
changed from an ugly humped line to a decidedly sharp parabola and
the horse left the ground with all four feet. He hit it again,
almost in the identical hoof-marks, and with all legs stiff. The
doctor sagged drunkenly in the saddle, and his head first swung far
back, and then snapped over so that the chin banged against his
chest. Nevertheless he clung to the saddle with both hands, and
stayed in his seat. The piebald swung his head around sufficiently
to make sure of the surprising fact, and then he commenced to buck
in earnest.</p>

<p>It was a lovely exhibition. He bucked with his head up and his
head between his knees. He bucked in a circle and in a straight
line and then mixed both styles for variety. He made little spurts
at full speed, leaped into the air, and came down stiff-legged at
the end of the run, his head between his braced forefeet, and then
he whirled as if on a peg and darted back the other way. He bucked
criss-cross, jumping from side to side, and he interspersed this
with samples of all his other kinds of bucking thrown in. That the
doctor stuck on the saddle was a miracle beyond belief. Of course
he pulled leather shamelessly throughout the contest, but riding
straight up is a good deal of a myth. Fancy riding is reserved for
circus men. The mountain-desert is a place where men stick close to
utility and let style go hang.</p>

<p>And the doctor stuck in the saddle. He had set his teeth, and he
was a sea-sick greenish-white. His hat was a-jog over one
ear&mdash;his shirt tails flew out behind. And still he remained to
battle. Aye, for he ceased the passive clinging to the saddle. He
gathered up the long quirt which had hitherto dangled idly from his
wrist, and at the very moment when the piebald had let out another
notch in his feats, the doctor, holding on desperately with one
hand, with the other brandished the quirt around his head and
brought it down with a crack along the flanks of the piebald.</p>

<p>The effect was a little short of a miracle. The mustang snorted
and leaped once into the air, but he forgot to come down
stiff-legged, and then, instantly, he broke into a little, soft dog
trot, and followed humbly in the trail of the black stallion. The
laughter and cheers from the house were the sweetest of music in
the ears of Doctor Randall Byrne; the most sounding sentences of
praise from the lips of the most learned of professors, after this,
would be the most shabby of anticlimaxes. He waved his arm back to
a group standing in front of the house&mdash;Buck Daniels, Kate,
the lantern-jawed cowboy, and Wung Lu waving his kitchen apron. In
another moment he was beside the rider of the stallion, and the man
was whistling one of those melodies which defied repetition. It
simply ran on and on, smoothly, sweeping through transition after
transition, soaring and falling in the most effortless manner. Now
it paused, now it began again. It was never loud, but it carried
like the music of a bird on wing, blown by the wind. There was
about it, also, something which escaped from the personal. He began
to forget that it was a man who whistled, and such a man! He began
to look about to the hills and the sky and the rocks&mdash;for
these, it might be said, were set to music&mdash;they, too, had the
sweep of line, and the broken rhythms, the sense of spaciousness,
the far horizons.</p>

<p>That day was a climax of the unusual weather. For a long time
the sky had been periodically blanketed with thick mists, but
to-day the wind had freshened and it tore the mists into a thousand
mighty fragments. There was never blue sky in sight&mdash;only, far
up, a diminishing and lighter grey to testify that above it the
yellow sun might be shining; but all the lower heavens were a-sweep
with vast cloud masses, irregular, huge, hurling across the sky.
They hung so low that one could follow the speed of their motion
and almost gauge it by miles per hour. And in the distance they
seemed to brush the tops of the hills. Seeing this, the doctor
remembered what he had heard of rain in this region. It would come,
they said, in sheets and masses&mdash;literal water-falls. Dry
arroyos suddenly filled and became swift torrent, rolling big
boulders down their courses. There were tales of men fording rivers
who were suddenly overwhelmed by terrific walls of water which
rushed down from the higher mountains in masses four and eight feet
high. In coming they made a thundering among the hills and they
plucked up full grown trees like twigs thrust into wet mud. Indeed,
that was the sort of rain one would expect in such a country, so
whipped and naked of life. Even the reviving rainfall was sent in
the form of a scourge, and that which should make the grass grow
might tear it up by the roots.</p>

<p>That was a time of change and of portent, and a day well fitted
to the mood of Randall Byrne. He, also, had altered, and there was
about to break upon him the rain of life, and whether it would
destroy him or make him live, and richly, he could not guess. But
he was naked to the skies of chance&mdash;naked as this
landscape.</p>

<p>Far past the mid-day they reached the streets of Elkhead and
stopped at the hotel. As the doctor swung down from his saddle,
cramped and sore from the long ride, thunder rattled over the
distant hills and a patter of rain splashed in the dust and sent up
a pungent odor to his nostrils. It was like the voice of the earth
proclaiming its thirst. And a blast of wind leaped down the street
and lifted the brim of Barry's hat and set the bandana at his
throat fluttering. He looked away into the teeth of the wind and
smiled.</p>

<p>There was something so curious about him at the instant that
Randall Byrne wanted to ask him into the hotel&mdash;wanted to have
him knee to knee for a long talk. But he remembered an old
poem&mdash;the sea-shell needs the waves of the sea&mdash;the bird
will not sing in the cage. And the yellow light in the eyes of
Barry, phosphorescent, almost&mdash;a thing that might be nearly
seen by night&mdash;that, surely, would not shine under any roof.
It was the wind which made him smile. These things he understood,
without fear.</p>

<p>So he said good-bye, and the rider waved carelessly and took the
reins of the piebald and turned the stallion back. He noted the
catlike grace of the horse in moving, as if his muscles were steel
springs; and he noted also that the long ride had scarcely stained
the glossy hide with sweat&mdash;while the piebald reeked with the
labour. Randall Byrne drew thoughtfully back onto the porch of the
hotel and followed the rider with his eyes. In a moment a great
cloud of dust poured down the street, covered the rider, and when
it was gone he had passed around a corner and out of the life of
the doctor.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap38" name="chap38">38. THE CHALLENGE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">All this time Black Bart had trotted contentedly
ahead of Satan, never having to glance back but apparently knowing
the intended direction; save that when Dan Barry turned to the road
leading out of the little town, the wolf-dog had turned in an
opposite direction. The rider turned in the saddle and sent a sharp
whistle towards the animal, but he was answered by a short howl of
woe that made him check Satan and swing around. Black Bart stood in
the centre of the street facing in the opposite direction, and he
looked back over his shoulder towards his master.</p>

<p>There was apparently a perfect understanding between them, and
the master first glanced up and made sure of the position of the
sun and the length of time he might allow for the trip home, before
he decided to follow the whim of the wolf-dog. Then he turned Satan
and cantered, with the piebald trailing, back towards Black
Bart.</p>

<p>At this the wolf-dog began to trot down the street, turned the
next corner, and drew up at the door of a rambling building above
which hung a dirty, cracked sign: "GILEAD SALOON" and underneath in
smaller letters was painted the legend: "Here's where you get
it!"</p>

<p>Black Bart strolled up to the swinging doors of the emporium and
then turned to look back at his master; clearly he wished Dan to
enter the place. But the rider shook his head and would certainly
have ridden on had not, at that moment, the rain which had hitherto
fallen only in rattling bursts, now burst over the roofs of the
town with a loud roaring as of wind through a forest. It was
possible that the shower might soon pass over, so Dan rode under
the long shelter which stretched in front of the saloon,
dismounted, and entered behind Black Bart.</p>

<p>It was occupied by a scattering of people, for the busy time of
the day had not yet commenced and Pale Annie was merely idling
behind the bar&mdash;working at half-speed, as it were. To this
group Black Bart paid not the slightest heed but glided smoothly
down the centre of the long room until he approached the tables at
the end, where, in a corner, sat a squat, thick-chested man, and
opposite him the most cadaverously lean fellow that Whistling Dan
had ever seen. Before these two Black Bart paused and then cast a
glance over his shoulder towards the master; Whistling Dan frowned
in wonder; he knew neither of the pair.</p>

<p>But Black Bart apparently did. He slouched a pace closer,
crouched, and bared his fangs with a tremendous snarl. At this the
lean man left his chair and sprang back to a distance. Terror
convulsed his face; but his eyes glittered with a fascinated
interest, and he glanced first at his companion and then at the
great wolf-dog, as if he were making a comparison between them. It
was the broad-shouldered man who first spoke.</p>

<p>"Partner," he said in a thick voice, in which the articulation
was almost lost, "maybe you better take your dog out before he gets
hurt. He don't like me and I don't like him none too much."</p>

<p>"Bart!" called Dan Barry.</p>

<p>But Black Bart gave no heed. There had been a slight flexing of
his muscles as he crouched, and now he leaped&mdash;a black bolt of
fighting weight&mdash;squarely in the face of the giant. He was met
and checked midway in his spring. For the two long arms darted out,
two great hands fastened in the throat of the beast, and Black Bart
fell back upon the floor, with Mac Strann following, his grip never
broken by the fall.</p>

<p>A scurry of many feet running towards the scene; a shouting of
twenty voices around him; but all that Whistling Dan saw were the
fangs of Bart as they gnashed fruitlessly at the wrists of Mac
Strann, and then the great red tongue lolling out and the eyes
bulging from their sockets&mdash;all he heard was the snarling of
the wolf and the peculiar whine of rage which came from the throat
of the man-beast fighting the wolf. Then he acted. His hands darted
between the thick forearms of Mac Strann&mdash;his elbows jerked
out and snapped the grip; next he dragged Black Bart away from the
danger.</p>

<p>The wolf was instantly on his feet and lunging again, but a
sharp "Heel!" from Dan checked him mid-leap. He came to a
shuddering halt behind the legs of his master. Whistling Dan
slipped a little closer to the giant.</p>

<p>"I should have knowed you before," he said in a voice which
carried only to the ears of Strann. "You're the brother of Jerry
Strann. And they's a reason why Bart hates you, partner!"</p>

<p>The thick upper lip of Strann lifted slightly as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Him or you&mdash;you and your wolf together or one by
one&mdash;it don't make no difference to me. I've come for you,
Barry!"</p>

<p>The other straightened a little, and his eyes travelled slowly
up and down the form of Strann.</p>

<p>"I been hungering to meet a man like you," he said. "Hungerin',
partner."</p>

<p>"North of town they's the old McDuffy place, all in ruins and
nobody ever near it. I'll be there in an hour, m'frien'."</p>

<p>"I'll be waiting for you there," nodded Mac Strann, and so
saying, he turned back to his table as if he had been interrupted
by nothing more than a casual greeting. Still Dan Barry remained a
moment with his eyes on the face of Mac Strann. And when he turned
and walked with his light, soundless step down the length of the
silent barroom, the wolf-dog slunk at his heels, ever and anon
swinging his head over his shoulder and glancing back at the giant
at the end of the room. As the door closed on man and dog, the
saloon broke once more into murmur, and then into an excited
clamoring. Pale Annie stepped from behind the bar and leaned upon
the table beside Mac Strann. Even while leaning in this manner the
bartender was as tall as the average man; he waved back the others
with a gesture of his tremendous arm. Then he reached out and took
the hand of Mac Strann in his clammy fingers.</p>

<p>"My friend," said the ex-undertaker in his careful manner, "I
seen a man once California a husky two-year-old&mdash;which nobody
said could be done, and I've seen some other things, but I've never
seen anything to touch the way you handled Black Bart. D'you know
anything about that dog?"</p>

<p>Mac Strann shook his ponderous head and his dull eyes considered
Pale Annie with an expression of almost living curiosity.</p>

<p>"Black Bart has a record behind him that an old time gun-man
would have heard with envy. There are dead men in the record of
that dog, sir!"</p>

<p>All this he had spoken in a comparatively loud voice, but now,
noting that the others had heeded his gesture and had made back
towards the bar to drink on the strength of that strange fight
between man and beast, the bartender approached his lips close to
the ear of the giant.</p>

<p>He said in a rapid murmur: "I watched you talking with Dan Barry
and I saw Barry's face when he went out. You and he are to meet
somewhere again to-day. My friend, don't throw yourself away."</p>

<p>Here Mac Strann stared down at his mighty hand&mdash;a
significant answer, but Pale Annie went on swiftly: "Yes, you're
strong, but strength won't save you from Dan Barry. We know him
here in Elkhead. Do you know that if he had pulled his gun and shot
you down right here where you sit, that he could have walked out of
this room without a hand raised to stop him? Yes, sir! And why?
Because we know his record; and I'd rather go against a wolf with
my bare hands&mdash;as you did&mdash;than stand up against Dan
Barry with guns. I could tell you how he fought Jim Silent's gang,
one to six. I could tell you a lot of other things. My friend, I
<i>will</i> tell you about 'em if you'll listen."</p>

<p>But Mac Strann considered the speaker with his dull eyes.</p>

<p>"I never was much on talkin'," he observed mildly. "I don't
understand talkin' very well."</p>

<p>Pale Annie started to speak again, but he checked himself,
stared earnestly at Mac Strann, and then hurried back behind his
bar. His face was even graver than usual; but business was business
with Pale Annie&mdash;and all men have to die in their time!
Haw-Haw Langley took the place which Pale Annie had left vacant
opposite Mac Strann.</p>

<p>He cast a frightened glance upward, where the rain roared
steadily on the roof of the building; then his eyes fluttered back
until they rested on the face of his companion. He had to moisten
his thin lips before he could speak and even then it was a
convulsive effort, like a man swallowing too large a morsel.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Haw-Haw. "Is it fixed?"</p>

<p>"It's fixed," said Mac Strann. "Maybe you'd get the hosses,
Haw-Haw. If you're comin with me?"</p>

<p>A dark shadow swept over the face of Haw-Haw Langley.</p>

<p>"You're going to beat it?" he sneered. "After you come all this
way you're going to run away from Barry? And him not half your
size?"</p>

<p>"I'm going out to meet him," answered Mac Strann.</p>

<p>Haw-Haw Langley started up as if he feared Mac Strann would
change his mind if there were any delay. His long fingers twisted
together, as if to bring the blood into circulation about the
purple knuckles.</p>

<p>"I'll have the hosses right around to the front," he said. "By
the time you got your slicker on, Mac, I'll have 'em around in
front!"</p>

<p>And he stalked swiftly from the room.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap39" name="chap39">39. THE STORM</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">When they rode out of the town the wet sand
squashed under the feet of their horses and splashed up on their
riding boots and their slickers. It even spotted their faces here
and there, and a light brown spray darted out to right and left of
the falling hoofs. For all the streets of Elkhead were running
shallow rivers, with dark, swift currents, and when they left the
little town the landscape was shut out by the falling torrents. It
made a strange and shifting panorama, for the rain varied in its
density now and again, and as it changed hills which had been quite
blotted out leaped close upon them, like living things, and then
sprang back again into the mist.</p>

<p>So heavy was that tropical fall of water that the horses were
bothered by the beating of the big drops, and shook their heads and
stamped fretfully under the ceaseless bombardment. Indeed, when one
stretched out his hand the drops stung him as if with lashes of
tiny whips. There was no wind, no thunder, no flash of lightning,
only the tremendous downpour which blended earth and sky in a drab,
swift river.</p>

<p>The air was filled with parallel lines, as in some pencil
drawings&mdash;not like ordinary rain, but as if the sky had
changed into a vast watering-spout and was sending down a
continuous flood from a myriad holes. It was hard to look up
through the terrific downpour, for it blinded one and whipped the
face and made one breathless, but now and again a puff of the rare
wind would lift the sodden brim of the sombrero and then one caught
a glimpse of the low-hanging clouds, with the nearest whiffs of
black mist dragging across the top of a hill. Without noticeable
currents of wind, that mass of clouds was shifting
slowly&mdash;with a sort of rolling motion, across the sky. And the
weight of the rain forced the two to bend their heads and stare
down to where the face of the earth was alive with the gliding,
brown waters, whose surface was threshed into a continual foam. To
speak to each other through the uproar, they had to cup their hands
about their lips and shout. Then again the rainfall around them
fell away to a drizzling mist and the beating of the downpour
sounded far away, and they were surrounded by distant walls of
noise. So they came to the McDuffy place.</p>

<p>It was a helpless ruin, long abandoned. Not an iota of the roof
remained. The sheds for the horses had dropped to the earth; but
the walls of the house still remained standing, in part, with the
empty windows looking out with a mocking promise of the shelter
which was not within. Upon this hollow shack the rain beat with
redoubled fury, and even before they could make out the place
through the blankets of rain, they heard the hollow drumming. For
there were times, oddly enough, when any sound would carry a great
distance through the crashing of the rain.</p>

<p>A wind now sprang up and at once veered the rain from its
perpendicular fall. It slashed them in the face under the drooping
brims of their sombreros, so they drew into the shelter of the
highest part of the standing wall. Still some of the rain struck
them, but the major part of it was shunted over their heads.
Moreover, the wall acted as a sort of sounding board, catching up
every odd noise from the storm-beaten plain beyond. They could
speak to each other now without effort.</p>

<p>"D'you think," asked Haw-Haw Langley, pressing his reeking horse
a little closer to Mac Strann, "that he'll come out after us in a
rain like this?"</p>

<p>But simple-minded Mac Strann lifted his head and peered through
the thick curtains of rain.</p>

<p>"D'you think," he parried, "that Jerry could maybe look through
all this and see what I'm doin' to-day?"</p>

<p>It made Haw-Haw Langley grin, but peering more closely and
observing that there was no mockery in the face of the giant, he
wiped out his grin with a scrubbing motion of his wet hand and
peered closely into the face of his companion.</p>

<p>"They ain't any doubt of it," he said reassuringly. "He'll know
what you do, Mac. What was it that Pale Annie said to you?"</p>

<p>"Wanted me not to meet Barry. Said that Barry had once cleaned
up a gang of six."</p>

<p>"And here we are only two."</p>

<p>"You ain't to fight!" warned Mac Strann sharply. "It'll be man
to man, Haw-Haw."</p>

<p>"But he might not notice that," cried Haw-Haw, and he caressed
his scrawny neck as though he already felt fingers closing about
his windpipe. "Him bein' used to fight crowds, Mac. Did you think
of that?"</p>

<p>"I never asked you to come," responded Mac Strann.</p>

<p>"Mac," cried Haw-Haw in a sudden alarm, "s'pose you wasn't to
win. S'pose you wasn't able to keep him away from me?"</p>

<p>The numb lips of Mac Strann sprawled in an ugly smile, but he
made no other answer.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> don't think you'll lose," hurried on Haw-Haw, "but
neither did them six that Pale Annie was tellin' about, most like.
But they did! They lost; but if you lose what'll happen to me?"</p>

<p>"They ain't no call for you to stay here," said Mac Strann with
utter indifference.</p>

<p>Haw-Haw answered quickly: "I wouldn't go&mdash;I wouldn't miss
it for nothin'. Ain't I come all this way to see it&mdash;I mean to
help? Would I fall down on you now, Mac? No, I wouldn't!"</p>

<p>And twisting those bony fingers together he burst once more into
that rattling, unhuman laughter which all the Three B's knew so
well and dreaded as the dying dread the sight of the circling
buzzard above.</p>

<p>"Stop laughin'!" cried Mac Strann with sudden anger. "Damn you,
stop laughin'!"</p>

<p>The other peered upon Mac Strann with incredulous delight, his
broad mouth gaping to that thirsted grin of enjoyment.</p>

<p>"You ain't gettin' nervous, Mac?" he queried, and thrust his
face closer to make sure. "You ain't bothered, Mac? You ain't
doubtin' how this'll turn out?" There was no answer and so he
replied to himself: "I know what done it to you. I seen it myself.
It was that yaller light in his eyes, Mac. My God, it come up there
out of nothin' and it wasn't a light that ought to come in no man's
eyes. It was like I'd woke up at night with a cold weight on my
chest and found two snakes' eyes glitterin' close to my face. Makes
me shivery, like, jest to think of it now. D'you notice that,
Mac?"</p>

<p>"I'm tired of talkin'," said Mac Strann hoarsely, "damned
tired!"</p>

<p>And so saying he swung his great head slowly around and glared
at Haw-Haw. The latter shrank away with an undulatory motion in his
saddle. And when the head of Mac Strann turned away again the broad
mouth began gibbering: "It's gettin' him like it done me. He's
scared, scared, scared&mdash;even Mac Strann!"</p>

<p>He broke off, for Mac Strann had jerked up his head and said in
a strangely muffled voice: "What was that?"</p>

<p>The bullet head of Haw-Haw Langley leaned to one side, and his
glittering eyes rolled up while he listened.</p>

<p>"Nothin'!" he said, "I don't hear nothin'!"</p>

<p>"Listen again!" cried Mac Strann in that same cautious voice, as
of one whispering in the night in the house of the enemy. "It's
like a voice in the wind. It comes down the wind. D'ye hear
now&mdash;now&mdash;now?"</p>

<p>It was, indeed, the faintest of faint sounds when Haw-Haw caught
it. It was, in the roar of the rain, as indistinct as some distant
light on the horizon which may come either from a rising star or
from the window of a house. But it had a peculiar quality of its
own, even as the house-light would be tinged with yellow when the
stars are cold and white. A small and distant sound, and yet it cut
through the crashing of the storm more and more clearly; someone
rode through the rain whistling.</p>

<p>"It's him!" gasped Haw-Haw Langley. "My God A'mighty, Mac, he's
whistlin'! It ain't possible!"</p>

<p>He reined his horse closer to the wall, listening with mouth
agape.</p>

<p>He shrilled suddenly: "What if he should hit us both, seein' us
together? They ain't no heart in a feller that can whistle in a
storm like this!"</p>

<p>But Mac Strann had lowered his head, bulldog-like, and now he
listened and thrust out his blunt jaw farther and farther and
returned no answer.</p>

<p>"God gimme the grit to stick it out," begged Haw-Haw Langley in
an agony of desire. "God lemme see how it comes out. God lemme
watch 'em fight. One of 'em is goin' to die&mdash;may be two of
'em&mdash;nothin' like it has ever been seen!"</p>

<p>The rain shifted, and the heart of the storm rolled far away.
For the moment they could look far out across the shadow-swept
hills, and out of the heart of the desolate landscape the whistling
ran thrilling upon them. It was so loud and close that of one
accord the two listeners jerked their heads about and stared at
each other, and then turned their eyes as hastily away, as though
terrified by what they had seen&mdash;each in the face of the
other. It was no idle tune which they heard whistled. This was a
rising, soaring paean of delight. It rang down upon the
wind&mdash;it cut into their faces like the drops of the rain; it
branded itself like freezing cold into their foreheads.</p>

<p>And then, upon the crest of the nearest hill, Haw-Haw Langley
saw a dim figure through the mist, a man on a horse and something
else running in front; and they came swiftly.</p>

<p>"It's the wolf that's runnin' us down!" screamed Haw-Haw
Langley. "Oh, God A'mighty, even if we was to want to run, the wolf
would come and pull us down. Mac, will you save me? Will you keep
the wolf away?"</p>

<p>He clung to the arm of his companion, but the other brushed him
back with a violence which almost unseated Haw-Haw.</p>

<p>"Keep off'n me," growled Mac Strann, "because when you touch me,
it feels like somethin' dead was next to my skin. Keep off'n
me!"</p>

<p>Haw-Haw dragged himself back into the saddle with effort, for it
was slippery with rain. His face convulsed with something black as
hate.</p>

<p>"It ain't long you'll do the orderin' and be so free with your
hands. He's comin'&mdash;soon! Mac, I'd like to stay&mdash;I'd like
to see the finish&mdash;" he stopped, his buzzard eyes glittering
against the face of the giant.</p>

<p>The rain blotted out the figure of the coming horseman, and at
the same instant the whistling leaped close upon them. It was as if
the whistling man had disappeared at the place where the rain
swallowed his form, and had taken body again at their very side.
Mac Strann shrank back against the wall, bracing his shoulders, and
gripped the butts of his guns. But Haw-Haw Langley cast a
frightened glance on either side, his head making birdlike, pecking
motions, and then he leaned over the pommel of his saddle with a
wail of despair and spurred off into the rain.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap40" name="chap40">40. THE ARROYO</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">He disappeared, instantly, in that shivering
curtain of greyness. Mac Strann sat by the ruined house alone.</p>

<p>Now, in a time of danger a child will give courage to the strong
man. There is a wonderful communion between any two in time of
crisis; and when Haw-Haw Langley disappeared through the rain it
was to Mac Strann as it was to Patroclus when Apollo struck the
base of his neck and his armour of proof fell from him. Not only
was there a singular sense of nakedness, but it seemed to him also
that the roaring of the rain became a hostile voice of threatening
at the same instant.</p>

<p>He had never in his life feared any living thing. But now there
was a certain hollowness in the region of his stomach, and his
heart fluttered like a bird in the air, with appalling lightness.
And he wished to be far away.</p>

<p>With a clear heaven above him&mdash;ay, that would be different,
but God had arranged this day and had set the earth like a stage in
readiness for a death. And that was why the rain lashed the earth
so fiercely. He looked down. After his death the wind would still
continue to beat that muddy water to foam. Ay, in that very place
all would be as it was at this moment. He would be gone, but the
sky and the senseless earth would remain unchanged. A sudden
yearning seized him for the cabin among the mountains, with the
singing of the coffee pot over the fire&mdash;the good, warm,
yellow fire that smoked between the rocks. And the skins he had
left leaning against the walls of the cabin to dry&mdash;he
remembered them all in one glance of memory.</p>

<p>Why was he here, then, when he should have been so far away,
making his roof snug against this torrent of rain. Now, there would
be no rain, surely, in those kindly mountains. Their tall peaks
would shut out the storm clouds. Only this plain, these low hills,
were the place of hell!</p>

<p>He swung the head of his horse to one side, drove deep the
spurs, and leaning his head to the volleying of the rain he raced
in a direction opposite to that in which Haw-Haw Langley had
disappeared, in a direction that led as straight as the line of a
flying bird towards that cabin in the mountains.</p>

<p>Now and then the forefeet of his great horse smashed into a pool
and sent a muddy shower of rain flying up. It crackled against his
slicker; it beat like hands against his face. Everything was
striving&mdash;all the elements of wind and rain&mdash;to hold him
back.</p>

<p>Yet flight brought a blessed sense of relief and of safety. He
eased the pace of his horse to a moderate gallop, and no longer
driving blindly through the hills, he made out, by peering into the
blast of rain, some of the pools which lay in his path, and swung
aside to avoid them.</p>

<p>The rain lightened again about him; he caught a view of the
kindly, sheltering hills on all sides; but as he urged his horse on
towards them a shrill flight of whistling fell upon his ears from
behind. He drew his horse at once to a halt and listened with his
heart knocking at his teeth.</p>

<p>It was impossible, manifestly, that the fellow could have
followed his track through the rain. For that matter, if the
wolf-fiend could follow traces over a plain awash with water, why
might they not as well follow the tracks of Haw-Haw Langley? There
was no good reason.</p>

<p>The whistling? Well, the whistler was far away in the heart of
the storm, and the sound was merely blown against the wind by a
chance echo. Yet he remained holding his rein taut, and listening
with all his might.</p>

<p>It came again, suddenly as before, sharp, and keen as a shaft of
light in the blackest heart of night, and Mac Strann leaned over
the pommel of his saddle with a groan, and drove the spurs home. At
the same instant the rain shut in over the hills again; a fresher
wind sprang up and drove the downpour into his face. Also its roar
shut out the possibility of any sound reaching him from behind.</p>

<p>He was the worse for that. As long as the whistling might reach
him he could tell how near the pursuer rode; but in this common
roar of the rain the man might be at any distance behind
him&mdash;on his very heels, indeed. Ay, Dan Barry might rush upon
him from behind. He had seen that black stallion and he would never
forget&mdash;those graceful, agile lines, that generous breast,
wide for infinite wind and the great heart. If the stallion were
exerted, it could overtake his own mount as if he were standing
still. Not on good footing, perhaps, but in this mucky ground the
weight of his horse was terribly against him. He drove the spurs
home again; he looked back again and again, piercing the driving
mist of rain with starting eyes. He was safe still; the destroyer
was not in sight; yet he might be riding close behind that wall of
rain.</p>

<p>His horse came to a sudden halt, sliding on all four feet and
driving up a rush of dirty water before him; even then he had
stopped barely in time, for his forefeet were buried to the knees
in water. Before Mac Strann lay a wide arroyo. In ordinary weather
it was dry as all the desert around, but now it had cupped the
water from miles around and ran bank full, a roaring torrent. On
its surface the rain beat with a continual crashing, like axes
falling on brittle glass; and the downpour was now so fearful that
Mac Strann, for all his peering, could not look to the other
side.</p>

<p>He judged the current to see if he might swim his horse across.
But even while he stared the stump of a cottonwood went whirling
down the stream, struck a rock, perhaps, on the bottom, flung its
entire bulk out of the water with the impact, and then floundered
back into the stream again and whirled instantly out of sight in
the sheeted rain.</p>

<p>No horse in the world could live through such a current. But the
arroyo might turn. He swung his horse and spurred desperately along
the bank, keeping his eye upon the bank. No, the stream cut back in
a sharp curve and headed him farther and farther in the direction
of the pursuer. He brought the mighty horse to another sliding halt
and swung about in the opposite direction, for surely there must
lie the point of escape. Desperately he rode, for the detour had
cost him priceless time, yet it might be made up. Ay, the stream
sloped sharply into the direction in which he wished to ride. For a
distance he could not judge, since seconds were longer than minutes
to Mac Strann now.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;the edge of the stream curved back again. He
thought it must be a short twist in the line of the arroyo, but
following it a little further he came to realise the truth. The
arroyo described a wide curve, and a sharp one, and to ride down
its banks on either side was merely to throw himself into the arms
of Whistling Dan.</p>

<p>Once he struck his fleshy forehead, and then turned with
gritting teeth and galloped back for the point at which he had
first arrived. To his maddened brain it occurred that the current
of the arroyo might by this time have somewhat abated. He might now
make his way across it. So he halted once more on the bank at the
point where the stream doubled back on its course and once more, in
an agony, studied the force of the current. It seemed so placid at
the first glance that he was on the verge of spurring the horse
into the wide, brown stream, but even as he loosened the reins a
gap opened in the middle of the water, widened, whirling at the
brim, and drew swiftly into a fierce vortex with a black, deep
bottom. Mac Strann tightened his reins again, and then turned his
horse, and waited.</p>

<p>Back the veriest coward against the wall and he becomes
formidable, and Mac Strann was one who had never feared before
either man or beast or the powers of the storm. Even now he dreaded
no reality, but there dwelt in his mind the memory of how Dan Barry
had glared at him in the Gilead Saloon, and how a flicker of yellow
light had glowed in the man's eyes&mdash;a strange and
phosphorescent glimmer that might be seen in the darkness of night.
When he turned the head of his horse away from the arroyo, he
waited as one waits for the coming of a ghost. There was the same
chill tingling in his blood.</p>

<p>Now the blanket of rain lifted and shook away to comparative
clearness&mdash;lifted, and for the first time he could look far
away across the plains. Nothing but grey, rain-washed desert met
his eyes, and then the whistling broke once more upon him at the
crest of a thrilling run. Mac Strann strained his eyes through the
mist of the storm and then he saw, vaguely as a phantom, the form
of a horseman rushing swiftly into the very teeth of the wind. The
whistle wavered, ended, and in its place the long yell of a wolf
cut the air. Mac Strann brandished a ponderous fist in defiance
that was half hysterical. Man or beast alone he would
meet&mdash;but a wolf-man!&mdash;he whirled the horse again and
urged him heedlessly into the water.</p>

<p>The whirlpool no longer opened before him&mdash;it had passed on
down the arroyo and left in its wake a comparative calm. So that
when the horse took the water he made good progress for some
distance, until Mac Strann could see, clearly, the farther bank of
the stream. In his joy he shouted to his horse, and swung himself
clear from his saddle to lighten the burden. At the same time they
struck a heavier current and it struck them down like a blow from
above until the water closed over their heads.</p>

<p>It was only for a moment, however; then they emerged, the horse
with courageously pricking ears and snorting nostrils just above
the flood. Mac Strann swung clear, gripping the horn of the saddle
with one hand while with the other he hastily divested himself of
all superfluous weight. His slicker went first, ripped away from
throat and shoulders and whipped off his body by one tug of the
current. Next he fumbled at his belt and tossed this also, guns and
all, away, striking out with his legs and his free arm to aid the
progress that now forged ahead with noticeable speed.</p>

<p>The current, to be sure, was carrying them farther down the
stream, but they were now almost to the centre of the arroyo and,
though the water boiled furiously over the back of the horse, they
forged steadily closer and closer to the safe shore.</p>

<p>It was chance that defeated Mac Strann. It came shooting down
the river and he saw it only an instant too late&mdash;a log
whipping through the surface of the stream as though impelled by a
living force. And with arrowy straightness it lunged at them. Mac
Strann heaved himself high&mdash;he screamed at the horse as though
the poor brute could understand his warning, and then the
tree-trunk was upon them. Fair and square it struck the head of the
horse with a thud audible even through the rushing of the stream.
The horse went down like lead, and Mac Strann was dragged down
beneath the surface.</p>

<p>He came up fighting grimly and hopelessly for life. For he was
in the very centre of the stream, now, and the current swept him
relentlessly down. There seemed to be hands in the middle of the
arroyo, and when he strove to battle his way to the edge of the
water the current tangled at his legs and pulled him back. Yet even
then he did not fear. It was death, he knew, but at least it was
death fighting against a force of nature rather than destruction at
the hands of some weird and unhuman agency. His arms began to grow
numb. He raised his head to pick out the nearest point on the shore
and make his last struggle for life.</p>

<p>What he saw was a black head cutting the water just above him,
and beside the horse, one hand upon the beast's mane, swam a man.
At the same instant a hand fastened on his collar and he was drawn
slowly against the force of the river.</p>

<p>In the stunning surprise of the first moment he could make no
effort to save himself, and as a result, all three were washed
hopelessly down the current, but a shrill warning from his rescuer
set him fighting again with all the power of his great limbs. After
that they forged steadily towards the shore. The black horse swam
with amazing strength, and breaking the force of the current for
the men, they soon passed from the full grip of the torrent and
forged into the smoother shallows at the side of the stream. In a
moment firm land was beneath the feet of Mac Strann, and he turned
his dull eyes of amazement upon Dan Barry. The latter stood beside
the panting black horse. He had not even thrown off his slicker in
the fording of the stream&mdash;there had been no time for even
that small delay if he wished to save Strann. And now he was
throwing back the folds of the garment to leave free play for his
arms. He panted from the fierce effort of the fording, but his head
was high, a singular smile lingered about the corners of his mouth,
and in his eyes Mac Strann saw the gleam of yellow, a signal of
unfathomable danger.</p>

<p>From his holsters Barry drew two revolvers. One he retained; the
other he tossed towards Mac Strann, and the latter caught it
automatically.</p>

<p>"Now," said the soft voice of Barry, "we're equally
armed&mdash;Down, Bart!&mdash;" (for the wolf-dog was slinking with
ominous intent towards the giant) "and there's the dog you shot. If
you drop me, you can send your next shot into Bart. If I drop you,
the teeth of Bart will be in your throat. Make your own terms;
fight in the way you want; knives, if you like 'em better than
guns, or&mdash;" and here the yellow flamed terribly in Barry's
eyes&mdash;"bare hand to hand!"</p>

<p>The grim truth sank slowly home in the dull mind of Mac Strann.
The man had saved him from the water to kill him on dry land.</p>

<p>"Barry," he said slowly, "it was your bullet that brung down
Jerry, but you've paid me back here. They's nothin' left on earth
worth fightin' for. There's your gun."</p>

<p>And he threw the revolver into the mud at Barry's feet, turned
on his heel, and lumbered off into the rain. There was no voice of
answer behind him, except a shrill whine of rage from Black Bart
and then a sharp command: "Down!" from the master. As the blanket
of rain shut over him, Mac Strann looked back. There stood the
strange man with the wolf crouched at his feet, and the teeth of
Bart were bared, and the hum of his horrible snarling carried to
Strann through the beat of the rain. Mac Strann turned again, and
plodded slowly through the storm.</p>

<p>And Dan Barry? Twice men had stood before him, armed, and twice
he had failed to kill. Wonder rose in him&mdash;wonder and a great
fear. Was he losing the desert, and was the desert losing him? Were
the chains of humanity falling about him to drag him down to a
tamed and sordid life? A sudden hatred for all men, Mac Strann,
Daniels, Kate, and even poor Joe Cumberland, welled hot in the
breast of Whistling Dan. The strength of men could not conquer him;
but how could their very weakness disarm him? He leaped again on
the back of Satan, and rode furiously back into the storm.</p>

<h2><a id="chap41" name="chap41">41. THE FALLING OF NIGHT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">It had been hard to gauge the falling of night on
this day, and even the careful eyes of the watchers on the
Cumberland Ranch could not tell when the greyness of the sky was
being darkened by the coming of the evening. All day there had been
swift alterations of light and shadow, comparatively speaking, as
the clouds grew thin or thick before the wind. But at length,
indubitably, the night was there. Little by little the sky was
overcast, and even the lines of the falling rain were no longer
visible. Before the gloom of the darkness had fully settled over
the earth, moreover, there came a change in the wind, and the
watchers at the rain-beaten windows of the ranch-house saw the
clouds roll apart and split into fragments that were driven from
the face of the sky; and from the clean washed face of heaven the
stars shone down bright and serene. And still Dan Barry had not
come.</p>

<p>After the tumult of that long day the sudden silence of that
windless night had more ill omen in it than thunder and lightning.
For there is something watching and waiting in silence. In the
living room the three did not speak.</p>

<p>Now that the storm was gone they had allowed the fire to fall
away until the hearth showed merely fragmentary dances of flame and
a wide bed of dull red coals growing dimmer from moment to moment.
Wung Lu had brought in a lamp&mdash;a large lamp with a circular
wick that cast a bright, white light&mdash;but Kate had turned down
the wick, and now it made only a brief circle of yellow in one
corner of the room. The main illumination came from the fireplace
and struck on the faces of Kate and Buck Daniels, while Joe
Cumberland, on the couch at the end of the room, was only plainly
visible when there was an extraordinarily high leap of the dying
flames; but usually his face was merely a glimmering hint in the
darkness&mdash;his face and the long hands which were folded upon
his breast. Often when the flames leapt there was a crackling of
the embers and the last of the log, and then the two nearer the
fire would start and flash a glance, of one accord, towards the
prostrate figure on the couch.</p>

<p>That silence had lasted so long that when at length the dull
voice of Joe Cumberland broke in, there was a ring of a most
prophetic solemnity about it.</p>

<p>"He ain't come," said the old man. "Dan ain't here."</p>

<p>The others exchanged glances, but the eyes of Kate dropped sadly
and fastened again upon the hearth.</p>

<p>Buck Daniels cleared his throat like an orator.</p>

<p>"Nobody but a fool," he said, "would have started out of Elkhead
in a storm like this."</p>

<p>"Weather makes no difference to Dan," said Joe Cumberland.</p>

<p>"But he'd think of his hoss&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Weather makes no difference to Satan," answered the faint,
oracular voice of Joe Cumberland. "Kate!"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Is he comin'?"</p>

<p>She did not answer. Instead, she got up slowly from her place by
the fire and took another chair, far away in the gloom, where
hardly a glimmer of light reached to her and there she let her head
rest, as if exhausted, against the back of the seat.</p>

<p>"He promised," said Buck Daniels, striving desperately to keep
his voice cheerful, "and he never busts his promises."</p>

<p>"Ay," said the old man, "he promised to be back&mdash;but he
ain't here."</p>

<p>"If he started after the storm," said Buck Daniels.</p>

<p>"He didn't start after the storm," announced the oracle. "He was
out in it."</p>

<p>"What was that," cried Buck Daniels sharply.</p>

<p>"The wind," said Kate, "for it's rising. It will be a cold
night, to-night."</p>

<p>"And he ain't here," said the old man monotonously.</p>

<p>"Ain't there things that might hold him up?" asked Buck, with a
touch of irritation.</p>

<p>"Ay," said the old rancher, "they's things that'll hold him up.
They's things that'll turn a dog wild, too, and the taste of blood
is one of 'em!"</p>

<p>The silence fell again.</p>

<p>There was an old clock standing against the wall. It was one of
those tall, wooden frames in which, behind the glass, the heavy,
polished disk of the pendulum, alternated slowly back and forth
with wearisome precision. And with every stroke of the seconds
there was a faint, metallic clangor in the clock&mdash;a falter
like that which comes in the voice of a very old man. And the sound
of this clock took possession of every silence until it seemed like
the voice of a doomsman counting off the seconds. Ay, everyone in
the room, again and again, took up the tale of those seconds and
would count them slowly&mdash;fifty, fifty-one, fifty-two,
fifty-three&mdash;and on and on, waiting for the next speech, or
for the next popping of the wood upon the hearth, or for the next
wail of the wind that would break upon the deadly expectancy of
that count. And while they counted each looked straight before him
with wide and widening eyes.</p>

<p>Into one of these pauses the voice of Buck Daniels broke at
length; and it was a cheerless and lonely voice in that large room,
in the dull darkness, and the duller lights.</p>

<p>"D'you remember Shorty Martin, Kate?"</p>

<p>"I remember him."</p>

<p>He turned in his chair and hitched it a little closer to her
until he could make put her face, dimly, among the shadows. The
flames jumped on the hearth, and he saw a picture that knocked at
his heart.</p>

<p>"The little bow-legged feller, I mean."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember him very well."</p>

<p>Once more the flames sputtered and he saw how she looked
wistfully before her and above. She had never seemed so lovely to
Buck Daniels. She was pale, indeed, but there was no ugly pinching
of her face, and if there were shadows beneath her eyes, they only
served to make her eyes seem marvelously large and bright. She was
pallid, and the firelight stained her skin with touches of tropic
gold, and cast a halo of the golden hair about her face. She seemed
like one of those statues wrought in the glory and the rich days of
Athens in ivory and in gold&mdash;some goddess who has heard the
tidings of the coming fall, the change of the old order, and sits
passive in her throne awaiting the doom from which there is no
escape. Something of this filtered through to the sad heart of Buck
Daniels. He, too, had no hope&mdash;nay, he had not even her small
hope, but somehow he was able to pity her and cherish the picture
of her in that gloomy place. It seemed to Buck Daniels that he
would give ten years from the best of his life to see her smile as
he had once seen her in those old, bright days. He went on with his
tale.</p>

<p>"You would have busted laughin' if you'd seen him at the Circle
Y Bar roundup the way I seen him. Shorty ain't so bad with a rope.
He's always talkin' about what he can do and how he can daub a rope
on anything that's got horns. He ain't so bad, but then he ain't so
good, either. Specially, he ain't so good at ridin'&mdash;you know
what bowed legs he's got, Kate?"</p>

<p>"I remember, Buck."</p>

<p>She was looking at him, at last, and he talked eagerly to turn
that look into a smile.</p>

<p>"Well, they was the three of us got after one two year
old&mdash;a bull and a bad 'un. Shorty was on one side and me and
Cuttle was on the other side. Shorty daubed his rope and made a
fair catch, but when his hoss set back the rope busted plumb in
two. Now, Shorty, he had an idea that he could ease the work of his
hoss a whole pile if he laid holts on the rope whenever his hoss
set down to flop a cow. So Shorty, he had holt on this rope and was
pulling back hard when the rope busted, and Shorty, he spilled
backwards out'n that saddle like he'd been kicked out.</p>

<p>"Whilst he was lyin' there, the bull, that had took a header
when the rope busted, come up on his feet agin, and I'll tell a man
he was rarin' mad! He seen Shorty lyin' on the ground, and he took
a run for Shorty. Me and Cuttle was laughin' so hard we couldn't
barely swing our ropes, but I made a throw and managed to get that
bull around both horns. So my Betty sits down and braces herself
for the tug.</p>

<p>"In the meantime little Shorty, he sits up and lays a hand to
his head, and same time he sees that bull come tearin' for him. Up
he jumps. And jest then the bull come to the end of the line and
wonk!&mdash;down he goes, head over heels, and hits the sand with a
bang that must of jostled his liver some, I'll be sayin'!</p>

<p>"Well, Shorty, he seen that bull fly up into the air and he lets
out a yell like the world was comin' to an end, and starts runnin'.
If he'd run straight back the other way the bull couldn't of run a
step, because I had him fast with my rope, but Shorty seen me, and
he come tearin' for my hoss to get behind him.</p>

<p>"That bull was like a cat gettin' to his feet, and he sights
Shorty tearin' and lights out after him. There they went
lickety-split. That bull was puffin' on the seat of Shorty's
trowsers and tossin' his horns and jest missin' Shorty by inches;
and Shorty had his mouth so wide open hollerin' that you could have
throwed a side of beef down his throat; and his eyes was buggin'
out. Them bow-legs of his was stretchin' ten yards at a clip, most
like, and the boys says they could hear him hollerin' a mile away.
But that bull, stretch himself all he could, couldn't gain an inch
on Shorty, and Shorty couldn't gain an inch on the bull, till the
bull come to the other end of the forty-foot rope, and then, whang!
up goes the heels of the bull and down goes his head, and his heels
comes over&mdash;wonk! and hits Shorty right square on the
head.</p>

<p>"Been an ordinary feller, and he wouldn't of lived to talk about
it afterwards, but seein' it was Shorty, he jest goes up in the air
and lands about ten yards away, and rolls over and hits his feet
without once gettin' off his stride&mdash;and then he <i>did</i>
start runnin', and he didn't stop runnin' nor hollerin' till he got
plumb back to the house!"</p>

<p>Buck Daniels sat back in his chair and guffawed at the memory.
In the excitement of the tale he had quite forgotten Kate, but when
he remembered her, she sat with her head craned a little to one
side, her hand raised for silence, and a smile, indeed, upon her
lips, but never a glance for Buck Daniels. He knew at once.</p>

<p>"Is it him?" he whispered. "D'you hear him?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" commanded two voices, and then he saw that old Joe
Cumberland also was listening.</p>

<p>"No," said the girl suddenly, "it was only the wind."</p>

<p>As if in answer, a far, faint whistling broke upon them. She
drew her hands slowly towards her breast, as if, indeed, she drew
the sound in with them.</p>

<p>"He's coming!" she cried. "Oh, Dad, listen! Don't you hear?"</p>

<p>"I do," answered the rancher, "but what I'm hearin' don't warm
my blood none. Kate, if you're wise you'll get up and go to your
room and don't pay no heed to anything you might be hearin'
to-night."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap42" name="chap42">42. THE JOURNEY INTO NIGHT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">There was no doubting the meaning of Joe
Cumberland. It grew upon them with amazing swiftness, as if the
black stallion were racing upon the house at a swift gallop, and
the whistling rose and rang and soared in a wild outburst. Give the
eagle the throat of the lark, and after he has struck down his prey
in the centre of the sky and sent the ragged feathers and the slain
body falling down to earth, what would be the song of the eagle
rising again and dwindling out of sight in the heart of the sky?
What terrible paean would he send whistling down to the dull earth
far below? And such was the music that came before the coming of
Dan Barry. It did not cease, as usual, at a distance, but it came
closer and closer, and it swelled around them. Buck Daniels had
risen from his chair and stolen to a corner of the room where not a
solitary shaft of light could possibly reach him; and Kate
Cumberland slipped farther into the depths of the big chair.</p>

<p>So that, in their utter silence, in spite of the whistling that
blew in upon them, they could hear the dull ticking of the tall
clock, and by a wretched freak of fate the ticking fell exactly in
with the soaring rhythm of the whistle and each had a part in the
deadliness of the other.</p>

<p>Very near upon them the music ceased abruptly. A footfall swept
down the hall, a weight struck the door and cast it wide, and Black
Bart glided into the room. He cast not a glance on either side. He
turned his head neither to right nor to left. But he held straight
on until he came to Kate Cumberland and there he stood before
her.</p>

<p>She leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Bart!" she said softly and stretched out her hands to him.</p>

<p>A deep snarl stopped the gesture, and at the flash of the long
fangs she sank into the chair. Old Joe Cumberland, with fearful
labour, dragged himself to a sitting position upon the couch, and
sitting up in this fashion the light fell fully upon his white face
and his white hair and his white beard, so that he made a ghostly
picture.</p>

<p>Then an outer door slammed and a light step, at an almost
running pace speeded down the hall, the door was swung wide again,
and Dan was before them. He seemed to bring with him the keen,
fresh air of the night, and at the opening of the door the flame in
the lamp jumped in its chimney, shook, and fell slowly back to its
original dimness; but by that glow of light they saw that the
sombrero upon Dan Barry's head was a shapeless mass&mdash;his
bandana had been torn away, leaving his throat bare&mdash;his
slicker was a mass of rents and at the neck had been crumpled and
torn in a thousand places as though strong teeth had worried it to
a rag. Spots of mud were everywhere on his boots, even on his
sombrero with its sagging brim, and on one side of his face there
was a darker stain. He had ceased his whistling, indeed, but now he
stood at the door and hummed as he gazed about the room. Straight
to Kate Cumberland he walked, took her hands, and raised her from
the chair.</p>

<p>He said, and there was a fibre and ring in his voice that made
them catch their breaths: "There's something outside that I'm
following to-night. I don't know what it is. It is the taste of the
wind and the feel of the air and the smell of the ground. And I've
got to be ridin'. I'm saying good-bye for a bit, Kate."</p>

<p>"Dan," she cried, "what's happened? What's on your face?"</p>

<p>"The mark of the night," he answered. "I don't know what else.
Will you come with me, Kate?"</p>

<p>"For how long? Where are you going, Dan!"</p>

<p>"I don't know where or how long. All I know is I've got to be
going. Come to the window. Take the air on your face. You'll
understand!"</p>

<p>He drew her after him and cast up the window.</p>

<p>"Do you feel it in the wind?" he called to her, turning with a
transfigured face. "Do you hear it?"</p>

<p>She could not speak but stood with her face lifted,
trembling.</p>

<p>"Look at me!" he commanded, and turned her roughly towards him.
There he stood leaning close to her, and the yellow light flickered
and waned and burned again in his eyes.</p>

<p>He had held her hands while he stared. Now he dropped them with
an exclamation.</p>

<p>"You're blank," he said angrily. "You've seen nothing and heard
nothing."</p>

<p>He turned on his heel.</p>

<p>"Bart!" he called, and walked from the room, and they heard the
padding of his soft step down the hall and on the porch and
then&mdash;silence.</p>

<p>Black Bart slunk to the door and into the hall, but instantly he
was back and peering into the gloom of the silent place like an
evil-eyed spectre.</p>

<p>A sharp whistle rang from outside, and Black Bart started. Still
he glided on until he stood before Kate; then turned and stalked
slowly towards the door, looking back after her. She did not move,
and with a snarl the wolf-dog whirled again and trotted back to
her. This time he caught a fold of her skirt in his teeth and
pulled on it. And under the pressure she made a step.</p>

<p>"Kate!" called Joe Cumberland. "Are you mad, girl, to dream of
goin' out in a night like this?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going!" she answered hurriedly. "I'm afraid&mdash;and I
won't leave you, Dad!"</p>

<p>She had stopped as she spoke, but Black Bart, snarling terribly,
threw his weight back, and dragged her a step forward.</p>

<p>"Buck," cried old Joe Cumberland and he dragged himself up and
stood tottering. "Shoot the damned wolf&mdash;for God's
sake&mdash;for my sake!"</p>

<p>Still the wolf-dog drew the girl in that snarling progress
towards the door.</p>

<p>"Kate!" cried her father, and the agony in his voice made it
young and sent it ringing through the room. "Will you go out to
wander between heaven and hell&mdash;on a night like this?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going!" she answered, "I won't leave you&mdash;but
oh&mdash;Dad!&mdash;"</p>

<p>He opened his lips for a fresh appeal, but the chorus of the
wild geese swept in upon the wind, blown loud and clear and
jangling as distant bells out of tune. And Kate Cumberland buried
her face in her hands and stumbled blindly out of the room and down
the hall&mdash;and then they heard the wild neighing of a horse
outside.</p>

<p>"Buck!" commanded Joe Cumberland. "He's stealin' my
girl&mdash;my Kate&mdash;go out! call up the boys&mdash;tell'em to
stop Dan from saddlin' a horse for Kate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait and listen!" cut in Buck Daniels. "D'you hear that?"</p>

<p>On the wet ground outside they heard a patter of galloping
hoofs, and then a wild whistling, sweet and keen and high, came
ringing back to them. It diminished rapidly with the distance.</p>

<p>"He's carryin' her off on Satan!" groaned Joe Cumberland,
staggering as he tried to step forward. "Buck, call out the boys.
Even Satan can't beat my hosses when he's carryin'
double&mdash;call 'em out&mdash;if you bring her back&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice choked and he stumbled and would have fallen to his
knees had not Buck Daniels sprang forward and caught him and
carried him back to the couch.</p>

<p>"What's happened there ain't no man can stop," said Buck
hoarsely. "God's work or devil's work&mdash;I dunno&mdash;but I
know there ain't no place for a man between Dan and Kate."</p>

<p>"Turn up the lights," commanded Joe Cumberland sharply. "Got to
see; I got to think. D'you hear?"</p>

<p>Buck Daniels ran to the big lamp and turned up the wick. At once
a clear light flooded every nook of the big room and showed all its
emptiness.</p>

<p>"Can't you make the lamp work?" asked the old ranchman angrily.
"Ain't they any oil in it? Why, Buck, they ain't enough light for
me to see your face, hardly. But I'll do without the light. Buck,
how far will they go? Kate's a good girl! She won't leave me,
lad!"</p>

<p>"She won't," agreed Buck Daniels. "Jest gone with Dan for a bit
of a canter."</p>

<p>"The devil was come back in his eyes," muttered the old man.
"God knows where he's headin' for! Buck, I brought him in off'n the
range and made him a part of my house. I took him into my heart;
and now he's gone out again and taken everything that I love along
with him. Buck, why did he go?"</p>

<p>"He'll come back," said the big cowpuncher softly.</p>

<p>"It's gettin' darker and darker," said Joe Cumberland, "and
they's a kind of ringing in my ears. Talk louder. I don't hear you
none too well."</p>

<p>"I said they was comin' back," said Buck Daniels.</p>

<p>Something like a light showed on the face of Joe Cumberland.</p>

<p>"Ay, lad," he said eagerly, "I can hear Dan's whistlin' comin'
back&mdash;nearer and nearer. Most like he was jest playin' a joke
on me, eh, Buck?"</p>

<p>"Most like," said Buck, brokenly.</p>

<p>"Ay, there it's ringin' at the door of the house! Was that a
footstep on the hall?"</p>

<p>"It was," said Buck. "They's comin' down the hall!"</p>

<p>But far, far away he heard the whistling of Dan Barry dying
among the hills.</p>

<p>"You let the lamp go out," said Joe Cumberland, "and now I can't
see nothing. Are they in the room?"</p>

<p>"They're here," said Buck Daniels, "comin' towards you now."</p>

<p>"Dan!" cried the old man, shading his eyes and peering
anxiously&mdash;"no, I can't see a thing. Can you find me,
lad?"</p>

<p>And Buck Daniels, softening his voice as much as he could,
answered. "I can find you."</p>

<p>"Then gimme your hand."</p>

<p>Buck Daniels slipped his own large hand into the cold fingers of
the dying cattleman. An expression of surpassing joy lay on the
face of Joe Cumberland.</p>

<p>"Whistlin' Dan, my Dan," he murmured faintly, "I'm kind of
sleepy, but before I go to sleep, to-night, I got to tell you that
I forgive you for your joke&mdash;pretendin' to take Kate
away."</p>

<p>"They's nothin' but sleep worth while&mdash;and goin' to sleep,
holdin' your hand, lad&mdash;"</p>

<p>Buck Daniels dropped upon his knees and stared into the wide,
dead eyes. Through the open window a sound of whistling blew to
him. It was a sweet, faint music, and being so light it seemed like
a chorus of singing voices among the mountains, for it was as pure
and as sharp as the starlight.</p>

<p>Buck Daniels lifted his head to listen, but the sound faded, and
the murmur of the night-wind came between.</p>
