<h1>Owners Up</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h1>W.A. Fraser</h1>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<p>CLATAWA had put racing in Walla Walla in cold storage.</p>

<p>You can't have any kind of sport with one individual, horse or man,
and Clatawa had beaten everything so decisively that the gamblers sat
down with blank faces and asked, "What's the use?"</p>

<p>Horse racing had been a civic institution, a daily round of joyous
thrills&mdash;a commendable medium for the circulation of gold. The Nez
Perces Indians, who owned that garden of Eden, the Palouse country, and
were rich, would troop into Walla Walla long rolls of twenty-dollar gold
pieces plugged into a snake-like skin till the thing resembled a black
sausage, and bet the coins as though they were nickels.</p>

<p>It was a lovely town, with its straggling clap-boarded buildings, its
U.S. Cavalry post, its wide-open dance halls and gambling palaces; it was
a live town was Walla Walla, squatting there in the center of a great
luxuriant plain twenty miles or more from the Columbia and Snake
Rivers.</p>

<p>Snaky Dick had roped a big bay with black points that was lord of a
harem of wild mares; he had speed and stamina, and also brains; so they
named him "Clatawa," that is, "The-one-who-goes-quick." When Clatawa
found that men were not terrible creatures he chummed in, and enjoyed the
gambling, and the racing, and the high living like any other creature of
brains.</p>

<p>He was about three-quarter warm blood. How the mixture nobody knew.
Some half-bred mare, carrying a foal, had, perhaps, escaped from one of
the great breeding ranches, such as the "Scissors Brand Ranch" where the
sires were thoroughbred, and dropped her baby in the herd. And the colt,
not being raced to death as a two-year-old, had grown into a big,
upstanding bay, with perfect unblemished bone, lungs like a blacksmith's
bellows and sinews that played through unruptured sheaths. His courage,
too, had not been broken by the whip and spur of pin-head jocks. There
was just one rift in the lute, that dilution of cold blood. He wasn't a
thoroughbred, and until his measure was taken, until some other equine
looked him in the eye as they fought it out stride for stride, no man
could just say what the cold blood would do; it was so apt to quit.</p>

<p>At first Walla Walla rejoiced when Snaky Dick commenced to make the
Nez Perces horses look like pack mules; but now had come the time when
there was no one to fight the "champ," and the game was on the hog, as
Iron Jaw Blake declared.</p>

<p>Then Iron Jaw and Snaggle Tooth Boone, and Death-on-the-trail Carson
formed themselves into a committee of three to ameliorate the
monotony.</p>

<p>They were a picturesque trio. Carson was a sombre individual,
architecturally resembling a leafless gaunt-limbed pine, for he lacked
but a scant half inch of being seven feet of bone and whip-cord.</p>

<p>Years before he had gone out over the trail that wound among sage bush
and pink-flowered ball cactus up into the Bitter Root Mountains with
"Irish" Fagan. Months after he came back alone; more sombre, more gaunt,
more sparing of speech, and had offered casually the statement that
"Fagan met death on the trail." This laconic epitome of a gigantic event
had crystallized into a moniker for Carson, and he became solely
"Death-on-the-trail."</p>

<p>Snaggle Tooth Boone had a wolf-like fang on the very doorstep of his
upper jaw, so it required no powerful inventive faculty to rechristen him
with aptitude.</p>

<p>Blake was not only iron-jawed physically, but all his dealings were of
the bullheaded order; finesse was as foreign to Iron Jaw as caviare to a
Siwash.</p>

<p>So this triumvirate of decorative citizens, with Iron Jaw as penman,
wrote to Reilly at Portland, Oregon, to send in a horse good enough to
beat Clatawa, and a jock to ride him. Iron Jaw's directions were
specific, lengthy; going into detail. He knew that a thoroughbred, even a
selling plater, would be good enough to take the measure of any
cross-bred horse, no matter how good the latter apparently was, running
in scrub races. He also knew the value of weight as a handicap, and the
Walla Walla races were all matches, catch-weights up. So he wrote to
Reilly to send him a tall, slim rider who could pad up with clothes and
look the part of an able-bodied cow puncher.</p>

<p>It was a pleasing line of endeavor to Reilly&mdash;he just loved that
sort of thing; trimming "come-ons" was right in his mitt. He fulfilled
the commission to perfection, sending up, by the flat river steamer, the
Maid of Palouse, what appeared to be an ordinary black ranch cow-pony in
charge of "Texas Sam," a cow puncher. From Lewiston, the head of
navigation, Texas Sam rode his horse behind the old Concord coach over
the twenty-five miles of trail to Walla Walla.</p>

<p>The endeavor had gone through with swift smoothness. Nobody but Iron
Jaw, Death-on-the-trail, and Snaggle Tooth knew of the possibilities that
lurked in the long chapp-legged Texas Jim and the thin rakish black horse
that he called Horned Toad.</p>

<p>As one spreads bait as a decoy, Sam was given money to flash, and
instructed in the art of fool talk.</p>

<p>Iron Jaw was banker in this game; while Snaggle Tooth ran the wheel
and faro lay-out in the Del Monte saloon. So, when Texas dribbled a
thousand dollars across the table, "bucking the tiger," it was show
money; a thousand that Iron Jaw had passed him earlier in the evening,
and which Snaggle Tooth would pass back to its owner in the morning.</p>

<p>There was no hurry to spring the trap. Texas Sam allowed that he
himself was an uncurried wild horse from the great desert; that he was
all wool and a yard wide; that he could lick his fighting weight in wild
cats; and bet on anything he fancied till the cows came home with their
tails between their legs. And all the time he drank: he would drink with
anybody, and anybody might drink with him. This was no piking game, for
the three students of get-it-in-big-wads had declared for a coup that
would cause Walla Walla to stand up on its hind legs and howl.</p>

<p>Of course Snaky Dick and his clique cast covetous eyes on the bank
roll that Texas showed an inkling of when he flashed his gold. That Texas
had a horse was the key to the whole situation: a horse that he was never
tired of describing as the king-pin cow-pony from Kalamazoo to
Kamschatka; a spring-heeled antelope that could run rings around any
cayuse that had ever looked through a halter.</p>

<p>But Snaky Dick went slow. Some night when Texas was full of hop he'd
rush him for a match. Indeed the Clatawa crowd had the money ready to
plunk down when the psychological pitch of Sam's Dutch courage had
arrived.</p>

<p>It was all going swimmingly, both ends of Walla Walla being played
against the middle, so to speak, when the "unknown quantity" drifted into
the game.</p>

<p>A tall, lithe man, with small placid gray eyes set in a tanned face,
rode up out of the sage brush astride a buckskin horse on his way to
Walla Walla. He looked like a casual cow-puncher riding into town with
the laudable purpose of tying the faro outfit hoof and horn, and,
incidentally, showing what could be done to a bar when a man was in
earnest and had the mazuma.</p>

<p>As the buckskin leisurely loped down the trail-road that ran from the
cavalry barracks to the heart of Walla Walla, his rider became aware of
turmoil in the suburbs. In front of a neat little cottages the windows of
which held flowers partly shrouded by lace curtains, a lathy individual,
standing beside a rakish black horse, was orating with Bacchanalian
vehemence. Gathered from his blasphemous narrative he knew
chronologically the past history of a small pretty woman with peroxided
hair, who stood in the open door. He must have enlarged on the
sophistication of her past life, for the little lady, with a crisp oath,
called the declaimer a liar and a seven-times misplaced offspring.</p>

<p>The rider of the buckskin checked his horse, threw his right leg
loosely over the saddle, and restfully contemplated the exciting
film.</p>

<p>The irate and also inebriated man knew that he had drawn on his
imagination, but to be told in plain words that he was a liar peeved him.
With an ugly oath he swung his quirt and sprang forward, as if he would
bring its lash down on the d&eacute;collet&eacute;d shoulders of the
woman.</p>

<p>At that instant something that looked like a boy shot through the door
as though thrust from a catapult, and landed, head on, in the bread
basket of the cantankerous one, carrying him off his feet.</p>

<p>The man on the buckskin chuckled, and slipped to the ground.</p>

<p>But the boy had shot his bolt, so to speak; the big man he had tumbled
so neatly, soon turned him, and, rising, was about to drive a boot into
the little fellow's rib. I say about to, for just then certain fingers of
steel twined themselves in his red neckerchief, he was yanked volte face,
and a fist drove into his midriff.</p>

<p>Of course his animosity switched to the newcomer; but as he essayed a
grapple the driving fist caught him quite neatly on the northeast corner
of his jaw. He sat down, the goggle stare in his eyes suggesting that he
contemplated a trip to dreamland.</p>

<p>The little woman now darted forward, crying in a voice whose
gladsomeness swam in tears: "Bulldog Carney! You always man&mdash;you
beaut!" She would have twined her arms about Bulldog, but the placid gray
eyes, so full of quiet aloofness, checked her.</p>

<p>But the man's voice was soft and gentle as he said: "The same Bulldog,
Molly, girl. Glad I happened along."</p>

<p>He turned to the quarrelsome one who had staggered to his feet: "You
ride away before I get cross; you smell like the corpse of a dead
booze-fighter!"</p>

<p>The man addressed looked into the gray eyes switched on his own for
inspection; then he turned, mounted the black, and throwing over his
shoulder, "I'll get you for this, Mister Butter-in!" rode away.</p>

<p>The other party to the rough-end-tumble, winded, had erected his five
feet of length, and with a palm pressed against his chest was emitting
between wheezy coughs picturesque words of encomium upon Bulldog, not
without derogatory reflections upon the man who had ridden away.</p>

<p>In the midst of this vocal cocktail he broke off suddenly to exclaim
in astonishment:</p>

<p>"Holy Gawd!"</p>

<p>Then he scuttled past Carney, slipped a finger through the ring of the
buckskin's snaffle and peered into the horse's face as if he had found a
long-lost friend.</p>

<p>Perhaps the buckskin remembered him too, for he pressed a velvet,
mouse-colored muzzle against the lad's cheek and whispered something.</p>

<p>The little man ran a hand up and down the horse's canon-bones with the
inquisitiveness of a blind man reading raised print.</p>

<p>Then he turned to Carney who had been chatting with Molly&mdash;in
full dignity of Walla Walla nomenclature Molly B'Damn&mdash;and asked:
"Where the hell d'you get Waster?"</p>

<p>A faint smile twitched the owner's tawny mustache, chased away by a
little cloud of anger, for in that land of many horse stealings to ask a
man how he had come by his horse savoured of discourtesy. But it was only
a little wizen-faced, flat-chested friend of Molly B'Damn's; so Carney
smiled again, and answered by asking:</p>

<p>"Gentle-voiced kidaloona, explain what you mean by the Waster. That
chum of mine's name is Pat&mdash;Patsy boy, often enough."</p>

<p>"Pat nothin'! nor Percy, nor Willie; he's just plain old Waster that I
won the Ranch Stakes on in Butte, four years ago."</p>

<p>"Guess again, kid," Carney suggested.</p>

<p>"Holy Mike! Say, boss, if you could think like you can punch you'd be
all right. That's Waster. Listen, Mister Cowboy, while I tell you 'bout
his friends and relatives. He's by Gambler's Money out of Scotch Lassie,
whose breedin' runs back to Prince Charlie: Gambler's Money was by
Counterfeit, he by Spendthrift, and Spendthrift's sire was imported
Australian, whose grandsire was the English horse, Melbourne. D'you get
that, sage-brush rider?"</p>

<p>"I hear sounds. Tinkle again, little man."</p>

<p>Molly laughed, her white teeth and honest blue eyes discounting the
chemically yellow hair until the face looked good.</p>

<p>The little man stretched out an arm, at the end of it a thin finger
levelled at the buckskin's head:</p>

<p>"Have you ever took notice of them lop ears?"</p>

<p>"Once&mdash;which was continuous."</p>

<p>"And you thought there was a jackass strain in him, eh?"</p>

<p>"Pat looked good to me all the time, ears and all."</p>

<p>"Well, them sloppy listeners are a throw-back to Melbourne, he was
like that. I've read he was a mean-lookin' cuss, with weak knees; but he
was all horse: and ain't Waster got bad knees? And don't he get that
buckskin from Spendthrift who was a chestnut, same's his dad,
Australian?" This seemed a direct query for he broke off to cough.</p>

<p>"Go on, lad&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sorry"&mdash;Molly was speaking&mdash;"this is Billy
MacKay. My old school chum, Bessie, his sister, wished him on me a month
ago to see what God's country could do for that busted chest."</p>

<p>The little man was impatient over the switch to himself&mdash;the
horse was the thing.</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for them dicky forelegs&mdash;Gawd! what a horse
Waster'd been. And if his owner, Leatherhead Mike Doyle, had kept the
weight offen him he'd 've stood up anyway, for he was the truest thing.
Say, Bulldog,&mdash;don't mind me, I like that name, it talks
good,&mdash;Waster didn't need no blinkers he didn't need no spurs; he
didn't need no whip&mdash;I'd as lief hit a child with the bud as hit
him. He'd just break his heart tryin'. Waster was Leatherhead's meal
ticket, dicky knees and all, till he threw a splint. It was the weight
that broke him down; a hundred and thirty-six pounds the handicapper give
him in the Gold Range Stakes at a mile and a quarter; at that he was
leadin' into the stretch and finished, fightin', on three legs. He was
beat, of course; and Leatherhead was broke, and I never see Waster again.
A trombone player in a beer garden would have known the little cuss with
them hot-jointed knees couldn't pack weight, and would 've scratched
him."</p>

<p>Carney put a hand caressingly on Jockey Mackay's shoulder, saying:
"You stand pat with me, kid&mdash;your heart is about human, I guess.
What was that hostile person's game?"</p>

<p>Molly explained with a certain amount of asperity:</p>

<p>"He comes here to-day, Bulldog&mdash;Well, you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carney nodded placidly.</p>

<p>"He'd seen me down in the Del Monte joint, and thought&mdash;well, he
was filled up on Chinese rum. He wasn't none too much like a man in
anything he said or done, but I was standin' for him so long as he don't
get plumb Injun."</p>

<p>"Injun? Cripes! An Injun's a drugstore gent compared to that stiff,
Slimy Red," Billy objected.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what started it, Bulldog,&mdash;Billy knew him."</p>

<p>"Knew him&mdash;huh! Slimy Red was the crookedest rider that ever
throwed a leg over a horse. He used to give his own father the wrong
steer and laugh when the old man's money was burnt up on a horse that
finished in the ruck."</p>

<p>"He comes in here palmin' off the moniker of Texas Sam, a big ranch
guy that sees blood on the moon when he's out for a time," Molly helped
with.</p>

<p>"I didn't know him at first," the little man admitted, "his face bein'
a garden of black alfalfa, till I sees that the crop is red for half an
inch above the surface where it had pushed through the dye. Then he says,
'I'll bet my left eye agin' your big toe,' and I'm on, for that's a great
sayin' with Slimy Red Smith&mdash;he was Slimy Red hisself. And politely,
not givin' the game away, but callin' him 'Texas,' I suggests that me and
Molly is goin' to sing hymns for a bit, and that he'd best push on."</p>

<p>"Soon's Billy warbles, 'Good-bye, stranger,'" Molly laughed, "this
Texas person goes up in the air. Well, you see the finish, Bulldog."</p>

<p>The little man had wrestled a coughing spell into subjection and with
apparent inconsistency asked, "Did you ever hear of it rainin' bullfrogs,
Mr. Carney?"</p>

<p>Carney nodded, a suspicion flashing upon him that the weak chest was
twin brother to a weak brain in Billy the Jock.</p>

<p>"Well, it's been rainin' discard race-horses about Walla Walla."</p>

<p>"Much of a storm?"</p>

<p>"They're comin' kind of thick. There's yours, Waster, and Slimy Red
has got Ding Dong; he's out of Weddin' Bells by Tambourine."</p>

<p>"Are you in a hurry, Bulldog?" Molly asked, fancying that Carney's
well-known courtesy was perhaps the father of his apparent interest.</p>

<p>"I was, Molly, till I saw you," he answered graciously, a gentle smile
lighting up his stern features.</p>

<p>"Oh, you gentleman knight of the road&mdash;always the silver-tongued
Bulldog. There's a bottle inside with a gold necktie on it, waitin' for a
real man to pull the cork. Come on, kid Billy."</p>

<p>The boy looked at Carney, and the latter said: "It's been a full moon
since I pattered with anybody about anything but fat pork and sundown.
We'll accept the little lady's invitation."</p>

<p>"I can give Waster four quarts of oats, Mr. Carney; I've been ridin'
in the way of a cure."</p>

<p>Carney laughed. "You're a sure little bit of all right, kid; the horse
first when it comes to grub&mdash;that's me; but I'll feed Pat when he's
bedded for the night. "</p>

<p>Inside the cottage Molly and Bulldog jaunted back over the life trail
upon which they had met at different times and in divers places.</p>

<p>But Jockey Mackay had been thrown back into his life's environment at
sight of Waster. He was as full of racing as the wine bottle was full of
bubbles; like the wine he effervesced.</p>

<p>"You been here in Walla Walla before?" he asked Carney, breaking in on
the memory of a funny something that had happened when Molly and Bulldog
were both in Denver.</p>

<p>"Some time since," Carney replied.</p>

<p>"D'you know about Clatawa?"</p>

<p>"Is it a mine or a cocktail, Billy?"</p>

<p>"Clatawa's a horse."</p>

<p>"I might have known," Carney murmured resignedly.</p>

<p>Then the little man narrated of Clatawa, and the fatuous belief Walla
Walla held that a horse with cold blood in his veins could gallop fast
enough to keep himself warm. He waxed indignant over this, declaring that
boneheads that held such crazy ideas ought to be bled white, that is in a
monetary way.</p>

<p>Carney, being a Chevalier d'Industrie, had a keen nose for oblique
enterprises, but up to the present he had enjoyed the little man's
chatter simply because he loved horses himself; but at this, the Clatawa
disease, he pricked his ears.</p>

<p>"What is your unsavory acquaintance, Slimy Red, doing here with Ding
Dong?" he asked.</p>

<p>A cunning smile twisted the lad's bluish lips as he lighted a
cigarette.</p>

<p>"Slimy Red is padded," he vouchsafed after a puff at the
cigarette.</p>

<p>"Padded!" Molly exclaimed, her blue eyes rounding.</p>

<p>"Sure thing. That herrin' gut can ride at a hundred and twenty pounds.
He's a steeplechase jock, gener'ly, though he's good on the flat, too.
He's got a couple of sweaters on under that corduroy jacket to make him
look big."</p>

<p>Carney laughed. "That explains something. When I pushed my fist
against his stomach I thought it had gone clean through&mdash;it sank to
the wrist; it was just as though I had punched a bag of feathers."</p>

<p>"But the upper cut was all right, Mr. Carney; it was a
lallapaloosa."</p>

<p>"Why all the clothes?" Molly asked.</p>

<p>"I've been dopin' it out," the boy answered. "It's all match races
here, catch weights; there ain't one of them could ride a flat car
without givin' it the slows, but they know what weight is in a race; they
know you can pile enough on to bring a cart horse and a winner of the
Brooklyn Handicap together."</p>

<p>"I see," Carney said contemplatively; "Slimy Red, if he makes a match,
figures to get a big pull in the weights."</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Mike; Walla Walla will bet the family plate on Clatawa;
they'll go down hook, line, and sinker, and then some. They'll fall for
the clothes and think Slimy weighs a hundred and seventy. D'you get
it?"</p>

<p>"Fancy I do," Carney chuckled. "The avaricious Mister Red is probably
here on a missionary venture; he aims to separate these godless ones from
the root of evil through having a trained thoroughbred, and an ample pull
in the weight."</p>

<p>"Now you're talkin'," Jockey Mackay declared. Then he relapsed into a
meditative silence, sipping his wine as he correlated several
possibilities suggested by the rainfall of racing horses in Walla
Walla.</p>

<p>Carney and Molly drifted into desultory talk again.</p>

<p>After a time Billy spoke.</p>

<p>"It ain't on the cards that a lot of money is comin' to Slimy
Red&mdash;he don't deserve it; he ought to be trimmed hisself."</p>

<p>"He sure ought," Molly corroborated.</p>

<p>"Hell!" the little man exclaimed; "nobody could never trim Red, 'cause
he never had nothin'. I got it! Somebody in Walla Walla is the angel; and
Red'll get a rakeoff. He don't own Ding Dong; he couldn't own a lead pad;
booze gets his."</p>

<p>"Billy," Molly's face went serious; "I can guess it in once&mdash;Iron
Jaw! Oh, gee! I've been blind. Iron Jaw, and Snaggle Tooth, and
Death-on-the-trail ain't men to cotton to a coot like Slimy Red; they're
gamblers, and don't stand for anything that ain't a man, only just while
they take his roll. They've been nursin' this four-flusher. It's been,
'Hello, Texas!' and 'Have a drink, Texas.' I've got it."</p>

<p>"Fancy you have, Molly," Bulldog submitted.</p>

<p>"Gawd! that's the combination," Billy declared. "I was right."</p>

<p>"And Iron Jaw has got a down on Snaky Dick that owns Clatawa over some
bad splits in bets," Molly added.</p>

<p>"The old game," Carney laughed. "When thieves fall out honest men win
a bet. It would appear from the evidence that Iron Jaw Blake&mdash;I know
his method of old&mdash;has sent out and got some one to ship in a horse
and rider to trim Clatawa, and turn an honest penny."</p>

<p>"You're gettin' warm, Bulldog, as we used to say in that child's
game," Molly declared. "I know the pippin; one Reilly, at Portland. I
heard Iron Jaw and this Texas talkin' about him."</p>

<p>Carney turned toward the little man. "What are we going to do about
it, Billy&mdash;do we draw cards?"</p>

<p>Billy sprang from his chair, and paced the floor excitedly. "Holy
Mike! there never was such a chance. Waster can trim Ding Dong to a
certainty at a mile and a quarter. See, Bulldog, that's his distance;
he's a stayer from Stayville; but he can't pack weight&mdash;don't forget
that. If you rode him&mdash;let's see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The little man stood back and eyed critically the tall package of bone
and muscle, that while it suggested no surplus flesh, would weigh
well.</p>

<p>"You're a hundred and seventy-five pounds, and you ride in one of 'em
rockin' chairs that'll tip the beam at forty pounds. What chance?
Slimy'll have a five-pound saddle; he could weigh in, saddle and all, a
hundred and twenty-five. You'd be takin' on a handicap of ninety pounds.
What chance?"</p>

<p>"I might get an Indian boy," Carney suggested.</p>

<p>"You might get a doll or a pet monkey," Billy sneered. "What
chance?"</p>

<p>"And they all work for Iron Jaw," Molly advised; "they'd blow; he'd
bribe them to pull the horse."</p>

<p>"What chance?" Billy repeated with the mournful persistency of a
parrot. "Guess I'll go out and tell Waster to forget he's a gentleman and
go on pluggin' among the sage brush as a cow-pony."</p>

<p>Carney rose when Billy had gone, saying, "Fancy I'll drift on to the
rest joint, Molly. I rather want to hold converse with a certain man
while the seeing's good, if he's about."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Bulldog," Molly answered, and her blue eyes followed the
figure that slipped so gracefully through the door, their depths holding
a look that was beautiful in its honest admiration. "God!" she whispered;
"why do women like him&mdash;gee!"</p>

<p>Billy was tickling a lop ear on the buckskin.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carney," he said in a low voice, one eye on the cabin door, "you
heard what Molly said about Bessie wishin' me on her, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Uh-huh!"</p>

<p>"Let me give you the straight info. Molly sent the money to Bessie to
bring me here; we was both broke. Then I found out Bessie had been
gettin' it for a year from her, 'cause I was sick and couldn't ride. I
hadn't saved none, thinkin' I'd got Rockefeller skinned to death as a
money-getter. It was the wastin' to make weight that got me. I don't have
to sweat off flesh now," he added pathetically; "I'm a hundred and
two."</p>

<p>"That's Molly Bur-dan" (her right name) "all over&mdash;I know her.
But don't worry kid. I haven't got anybody to look after, and having
money and no use for it makes me lonesome. You give me Bessie's address,
and don't tout off Molly that you're doing it."</p>

<p>"I can get the money myself, Mr. Carney&mdash;you just listen now. I
didn't spring it inside 'cause Molly 'd get hot under the collar; she'd
say that if I rode in a race I'd bust a lung. Gee! ridin' to me is just
like goin' by-bye in a hammock; it 'd do me good."</p>

<p>Carney put a hand gently on the boy's shoulder, saying: "The size of
the package doesn't mean much when it comes to being a man, does it, kid?
Spring it; get it off your chest."</p>

<p>Billy made a horseshoe in the sand with the toe of his boot
meditatively; then said:</p>

<p>"Slimy Red, of course, will be lookin' for a match for Ding Dong. Most
of the races here is sprints, the old Texas game of half-a-mile, and
weight don't cut much ice that distance. He'll make it for a mile, or a
mile-and-a-quarter, 'cause Ding Dong could stay that distance pretty well
himself. If you was to match Waster against the black, and let me ride
him, I'd bring home the bacon. He's a fourteen pound better horse than
Ding Dong ever was; a handicapper would separate them that much on their
form. Gee! I forgot somethin'," and Billy, a shame-faced look in his
eyes, gazed helplessly at Bulldog.</p>

<p>"What was it dropped out of your think-pan, kid?"</p>

<p>"The roll. I've been makin' a noise like a man with a bank behind him.
A match ain't like where a feller can go into the bettin' ring if he
knows a couple of hundred-to-one chances and parley a shoe-string into a
block of city houses; a match is even money, just about. And to win a big
stake you've got to have the long green."</p>

<p>"How much, Billy?"</p>

<p>"Well, the Iron Jaw bunch, bein' whisky men and gamblers, naturally
would stand to lose twenty thousand, at least."</p>

<p>"I could manage it in a couple of days, Billy, by keeping the wires
hot."</p>

<p>"Before I forget it, Mr. Carney, if you do buck this crowd make it
catch weights. Slimy Red don't own a hair in Ding Dong's tail, of course,
but he'll have a bill of sale right enough showin' he's the owner, and as
he can ride light they'll word it, 'owners up'".</p>

<p>Carney was thinking fast, and a glint of light shot athwart his placid
gray eyes.</p>

<p>"Happy thought, Kid; we'll string with them on that; we'll make it
owners up."</p>

<p>"I said catch weights," Billy snapped irritably.</p>

<p>Carney answered with only a quizzical smile, and the boy, turning,
walked around the horse eyeing him from every angle. He lifted first one
foot and then the others, examining them critically, pressing a thumb
into the frogs. He pinched with thumb and forefinger the tendons of both
forelegs; he squeezed the horse's windpipe till the latter coughed; then
he said:</p>

<p>"Please, Mr. Carney, mount and give him half a furlong at top speed,
finishin' up here. Make him break as quick as you can till I see if he's
got the slows."</p>

<p>As obedient as a servant Bulldog swung to the saddle, centered the
buckskin down the road, wheeled, brought the horse to a standstill, and
then, with a shake of the rein and a cry of encouragement, came tearing
back, the pound of the horse's hoofs on the turf palpitating the air like
the roll of a kettle-drum.</p>

<p>"Great!" the boy commented when Carney, having gently eased the horse
down, returned. "He's the same old Waster; he flattens out in that stride
of his till he looks like a pony. His flanks ain't pumpin' none. He'll
do; he's had lots of work&mdash;he's in better condition than Ding Dong,
'cause Slimy Red's been puttin' in most of his trainin' time at the bar.
I got a three-pound saddle in my trunk that I won the 'Kenner Stakes' at
Saratoga on. Slimy Red will be givin' me about ten pounds if you make the
match catch weights; it'll be a cinch&mdash;like gettin' money from home.
But don't tell Molly."</p>

<p>"We'll split fifty-fifty," Carney said.</p>

<p>"Nothin' doin', Mister Mug; you cop the coin for yourself&mdash;how
much are you goin' to bet?"</p>

<p>"Five or ten thousand."</p>

<p>"Well, you give me ten per cent of the five thousand&mdash;five
hundred bucks, if we win. That'll square Molly's bill for bringin' me up
here."</p>

<p>"Come inside, kid," Carney said; "I want to write out something."</p>

<p>Inside Carney said, "Molly, I'm going to give Pat to Billy for a
riding horse&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>But Billy's gasp of astonishment was choked by a frowning wink of one
of Bulldog's gray eyes.</p>

<p>"Pat's getting a little old for the hard knocks I have to give a
horse," Carney resumed; "that's partly what I came to Walla Walla for, to
get a young horse. Let me have a sheet of paper and a pen; it doesn't do
for a man to own a horse in this country without handy evidence as how he
came by him; and though this is a gift I'm going to make it out in the
form of a bill of sale."</p>

<p>Carney drew up a simple bill of sale, stating, that for one dollar,
paid in hand, he transferred his buckskin horse "Pat" to William Mackay.
Molly signed it as witness.</p>

<p>"I'll have to keep Pat for a day or two till I get a new pony."
Bulldog declared; "also rather think I'll leave this bill of sale with a
friend in town for safe keeping, Billy might lose it," and a wink closed
one of the gray eyes that were turned on the boy's face.</p>

<p>As Carney sat the buckskin outside, he whispered, "Do you get it,
Billy&mdash;owners up?"</p>

<p>"Gee! I get you."</p>

<p>The little man had been mystified.</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry over the race," he advised; "make it for one week
away. That'll give me a chance to give Waster a few lessons in breakin'
to bring him back to the old days. I'll put a heavy blanket about his
neck for a gallop or two and sweat some of the fat off his pipes. I can
get a set of racin' plates made for him, too, for a pound off his feet is
four pounds off his back. We'll give him all the fine touches, Mr.
Carney, and Waster 'll do his part."</p>

<p>The little man watched the buckskin lope down toward Walla Walla, then
he turned in to the cottage where he was greeted by Molly's:</p>

<p>"Ain't Bulldog some man, Billy?"</p>

<p>"Will you tell me something, Molly?" the boy asked hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Shoot," she commanded.</p>

<p>"Is he&mdash;was he&mdash;the man&mdash;Bessie told me something?"</p>

<p>"There ain't no woman on God's footstool, Billy, can say Bulldog
Carney was the man that fell down. That's why we all like him. There
ain't a woman on the Gold Coast that ever lamped Bulldog that wouldn't
stake him if she had to put her sparklers in hock. And there ain't a man
that knows him that'll try to put one over&mdash;'tain't healthy. He's
got a temper as sweet as a bull pup's, but he's lightnin' when he starts.
He don't cotton to no girl, 'cause he was once engaged to one of the
sweetest you ever see, Billy."</p>

<p>"Did she die, Molly?"</p>

<p>"The other man did! And nothin' was done to Bulldog 'cause it was
comin' to the hound."</p>

<p>Carney rode on till he came to the Mountain House. Here he was at home
for the proprietor was an old Gold Range friend.</p>

<p>First he saw that the buckskin had a worthy supper, then he ate his
own.</p>

<p>When it had grown dark and the gleaming lights of the Del Monte Saloon
were throwing their radiancy out into the street, he put the bridle on
his buckskin and rode to the house of "Teddy the Leaper," who was Sheriff
of Shoshone County.</p>

<p>The sheriff welcomed Carney with a differential friendship that showed
they stood well together as man to man; for though Bulldog's reputation
varied in different places, and with different people, it stood strongest
with those who had known him longest, and who, like most men of the West,
were apt to judge men from their own experience.</p>

<p>Teddy the Leaper admired Bulldog Carney the man; he would have staked
his life on anything Carney told him. Officially, as sheriff, the County
of Shoshone was his bailiwick, and the County of Shoshone held nothing on
its records against Carney. "Always a gentleman," was Teddy's summing up
of Bulldog Carney.</p>

<p>Carney drew an envelope from his pocket, saying: "Will you take care
of this for me, Sheriff? Inside is a bill of sale of my horse."</p>

<p>"What, Bulldog&mdash;the buckskin?" Teddy's eyes searched the
speaker's face; it was unbelievable. A light dawned upon the sheriff;
Bulldog had put many a practical joke over&mdash;he was kidding. Teddy
laughed.</p>

<p>"Bulldog," he said, "I've heard that you was English, a son of one of
them bloated lords, but faith it's Irish you are. You've as much humor as
you've nerve&mdash;you're Irish."</p>

<p>"There's also a note in that envelope"&mdash;Carney ignored the
chaff&mdash;"that directs you to pay over to a little lad that's up
against it out at Molly's place, any money that might happen to be in
your hands if I suddenly&mdash;well, if I didn't need it&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>"I'll do that, Bulldog."</p>

<p>"Think you'll be at the Del Monte to-night, Sheriff?" Carney asked
casually.</p>

<p>Teddy's Irish eyes flashed a quizzical look on the speaker; then he
answered diplomatically: "There ain't no call why I got to be
there&mdash;lest I'm sent for, and I ain't as spry gettin' around as I
was when I made that record of forty-six feet for the hop-step-and-jump.
If you've got anything to settle, go ahead."</p>

<p>Carney rippled one of his low musical laughs: "I'd like to line you up
at the bar, Sheriff, for a thimbleful of poison."</p>

<p>Teddy's eyes again sought the speaker's mental pockets, but the placid
face showed no warrant for expected trouble. The Sheriff coughed, then
ventured:</p>

<p>"If you're goin' to stack up agin odds, Bulldog, I'll dress for the
occasion; I don't gener'ly go 'round hostile draped."</p>

<p>Again Carney laughed. "You might bring a roomy pocket, Sheriff; it
might so turn out that I'd like you to hold a few eagle birds till such
times as they're right and proper the property of another man or myself.
Does that put any kink in your code?"</p>

<p>"Not when I act for you, Bulldog; 'cause it'll be on the level: I'll
be there."</p>

<p>Next Carney rode to the Del Monte and hitching the buckskin to a post,
he adjusted his belt till the butt of his gun lay true to the drop of his
hand.</p>

<p>As he entered the saloon slowly, his gray eyes flashed over the bar
and a group of men on the right of the gaming tables, for there was one
man perhaps in Walla Walla he wanted to see before the other saw him. It
wasn't Slimy Red&mdash;it was a tougher man.</p>

<p>Iron Jaw was leaning against the bar talking to Death-on-the-trail,
and behind the bar Snaggle Tooth Boone stood listening to the
conversation.</p>

<p>As Carney entered a quick look of apprehension showed for an instant
in Iron Jaw's heavy-browned eyes; then a smile of greeting curled his
coarse lips. He held out a hand, saying: "Glad to see you, Old Timer. You
seem conditioned. Know Carson?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Carney shook hands with the two men, and reached across to clasp
Boone's paw, adding: "We'll sample the goods, Snaggle Tooth."</p>

<p>Boone winced at the appellation, for Carney did not smile; there was
even the suspicion of a sneer on the lean face.</p>

<p>"How is Walla Walla?" Carney queried, as the four glasses were held
toward each other in salute. "Racing relieved by a little gun argument
once in a while, I suppose. Chief Joseph threatening to let his Nez
Perces loose on you?"</p>

<p>"Racin' is on the hog," Iron Jaw growled. "There's a bum over yonder
pikin' agin the Wheel that's been stung by the racin' bug, but when he
calls for a show-down some of 'em will trim him. Hear that?"</p>

<p>Iron Jaw held up a thumb, and they could hear a thin strident voice
babbling:</p>

<p>"Walla Walla's a nursery for tin horn sports. There ain't a man here
got anythin' but a goose liver pumpin' his system, and a length of rubber
hose up his back holdin' his ribs."</p>

<p>Somebody objected; and the voice, that Carney recognized as Texas
Sam's snarled:</p>

<p>"Five birds of liberty! You call that bettin'&mdash;a hundred iron
men?"</p>

<p>"Want to see him?" Iron Jaw queried. "I can't place him. Texas Sam he
comes here as; seems to be well fixed; but he's a booze fighter. I guess
that's what gives him dreams."</p>

<p>Quiescently Bulldog followed the lead of Iron Jaw and
Death-on-the-trail across the room where, with his back to the door, at a
roulette table sat Texas Sam. He was winning; three stacks of chips rose
to a toppling height at his right hand.</p>

<p>Carney noticed from the color that they were five dollar chips.
Knowing from Molly that Texas was a stool pigeon he understood the
philosophy of the high-priced counters. It was easier to keep tally on
what he drew and what he turned back in after the game, for the losings
and the winnings were all a bluff, and the money furnished him for the
show had to be accounted for. Iron Jaw trusted no man.</p>

<p>"The game's like roundin' up a bunch of cows heavy in calf," Texas was
saying as they approached; "it's too damn slow. I want action."</p>

<p>He placed five chips on the thirteen as the croupier spun the wheel,
bleating:</p>

<p>"Hoodoo thirteen's my lucky number. I was whelped on Friday the
thirteenth, at thirteen o'clock&mdash;as you old leatherheads make it,
one A.M."</p>

<p>The little ivory ball skipped and hopped as it slid down from the
smooth plane of the wheel to the number chambers. It almost settled into
one, and then, as if agitated by some unseen devil of perversity, rolled
over the thin wall and lay, like a bird's egg, in a black nest that was
number "13."</p>

<p>"By a nose!" Texas exulted. "Do I win, Judge?"</p>

<p>The croupier's face was as expressionless as the silver veil of
Mahmoud as he built into pillars over eight hundred dollars in chips, and
shoved them across the board to Texas.</p>

<p>The noisy one swept them to the side of the table, and called for a
drink.</p>

<p>It was a curiously diversified interest that centered on this play of
the uncouth Texas. Iron Jaw and Death-on-the-trail viewed it with
apathetic interest, much as a trainer might watch a pupil punching the
bag&mdash;it didn't mean anything.</p>

<p>Carney, too, knowing its farcical value, looked on, waiting for his
opportunity.</p>

<p>Snaky Dick sat across the table from Texas, dribbling a few fifty-cent
chips here and there amongst the numbers, also waiting. To him the play
was real; he had seen it in reality a thousand times&mdash;a man loaded
with bad liquor and in possession of money running the gamut. Behind
Snaky Dick sat others of the Clatawa clique waiting for his lead. Their
money was ready to cinch the match as soon as made.</p>

<p>Iron Jaw watched Snaky Dick furtively; the time seemed ripening. They
had arranged, through some little vagaries of the wheel, vagaries that
could be brought out by the assistance of the croupier, that apparently
Texas should make a killing.</p>

<p>Now the croupier called out: "Make your bets, gentlemen." He gave the
wheel a send-off with finger and thumb, his droning voice singing the
cadence of: "Hurry up, gentlemen! Make your bets while the merry-go-round
plays on."</p>

<p>"For a repeat," Texas shrilled, dropping the chips one after another
on to the thirteen square until they stood like a candle. Impatiently the
croupier checked him:</p>

<p>"Mind the limit, Mister."</p>

<p>"When I play the sky's my limit," Texas answered.</p>

<p>"Not here," the croupier admonished, sweeping three-quarters of the
ivory discs from thirteen.</p>

<p>The little ball of peripatetic fate that had held on its erratic way
during this, now settled down into a compartment painted green.</p>

<p>"Double zero!" the croupier remarked, and swept the table bare.</p>

<p>Texas cursed. "There ain't no double zero in racin'; there ain't no
green-eyed horse runnin' for the the track&mdash;everybody's got a
chance. Here! I'm goin' to cash in."</p>

<p>He shoved the ivory chips irritably across the table, and the
croupier, stacking them in his board, said: "A thousand and fifty."</p>

<p>As methodically as he had built up the chips, from a drawer he erected
little golden plinths of twenty-dollar pieces, and with both hands pushed
them toward the winner.</p>

<p>Texas put the palm of his hand on the shiny mound, saying:</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to orate; I'm gettin' plumb hide-bound 'cause of this long
sleep in Walla Walla. To-morrow I'm pullin' my freight down the trail to
the outside where men is. But these yeller-throated singin' birds says I
got a cow-hocked whang-doodle on four hoofs named Horned Toad that can
outrun anything that eats with molars in Walla Walla, from a
grasshopper's jump to four miles. Now I've said it, ladies&mdash;who's
next?"</p>

<p>A quiet voice at his elbow answered almost plaintively: "If you will
take your paw off those yellow boys I'll bury them twice."</p>

<p>At the sound of that drawling voice Texas sprang to his feet, whirled,
and seeing Carney, struck at him viciously. Carney simply bent his lithe
body, and the next instant Iron Jaw had Texas by the throat, shaking him
like a rat.</p>

<p>"You damn locoed fool!" he swore; "what d'you mean?&mdash;what d'you
mean?" each query being emphasized by a vigorous shake.</p>

<p>"He simply means," explained Carney, "that he's a cheap
bluffer&mdash;a wind gambler. When he's called he quits. That's just what
I thought."</p>

<p>"Give him a chance, Blake," Death-on-the-trail interposed; "let
go!"</p>

<p>Iron Jaw pressed Texas back into his chair, saying:</p>

<p>"You've got too much booze. If you want to bet on your horse sit there
and cut out this Injun stuff."</p>

<p>Snaky Dick had jumped to his feet, startled by the fact that Carney
was about to break in on his preserve. Now he said: "If Texas is pinin'
for a race Clatawa is waitin'&mdash;so is his backin'."</p>

<p>Carney turned his gray eyes on the speaker:</p>

<p>"There's a rule in this country, Snaky, that when two men have got a
discussion on, others keep out. I've undertaken to call this jack
rabbit's bluff, and he makes good, or takes his noisy organ away to play
it outside of Walla Walla."</p>

<p>Texas Sam had received a thumb in the rib from Iron Jaw that meant,
"Go ahead," so he said, surlily: "There's my money on the table. Anybody
can come in&mdash;the game's wide open."</p>

<p>"That being so," Carney drawled, "there's a little buckskin horse tied
to the post outside, that's carried me for three years around this land
of delight, and he looks good to me."</p>

<p>He unslung from his waist a leather roll, and dropped its snake-like
body across the Texas coin, saying:</p>

<p>"There's two thousand in twenties, and if this cheap-singing person
sees the raise, it goes for a race at a mile-and-a-quarter between the
little buckskin outside and this cow-hocked mule he sings about."</p>

<p>"I want to see this damn buckskin," Texas objected.</p>

<p>"You don't need to worry," Iron Jaw commented; "the horse is pretty
nigh as well known as Bulldog."</p>

<p>But Texas, having been born in a very nest of iniquity, having been
stable boy, tout, half-mile-track ringer, and runner for a wire-tapping
bunch, was naturally suspicious.</p>

<p>"I don't match against an unknown," he objected; "let me lamp this
Flyin' Dutchman of the Plains; it may be Salvator for all I know."</p>

<p>"Let him get out the door," Carney sneered "it will be
good-bye&mdash;we'll never see him again."</p>

<p>"And if we don't," Snaky Dick interposed, "I'll cover your money,
Carney."</p>

<p>Bulldog swung the gray eyes, and levelled them at the red-and-yellow
streaked beads that did seeing duty in Snaky's face:</p>

<p>"You ever hear about the gent who was kicked out of Paradise and told
to go scoot along on his belly for butting in?" Then he followed the
little crowd at Texas Sam's heels.</p>

<p>In the yellow glare of the Del Monte lights the buckskin looked very
little like a race horse. He stood about fifteen and a quarter hands,
looking not much more than a pony, as, half asleep, he had relaxed his
body; the lop ears hanging almost at right angles to his lean bony head
suggested humor more than speed. He stood "over" on his front legs, a
habit contracted when he favoured the weak knees. As he was a gelding his
neck was thin, so far removed from a crest that it was almost ewe-like;
his tremendous width of rump caused the hip bones to project, suggesting
an archaic design of equine structure. The direct lamplight threw
cavernous shadows all over his lean form.</p>

<p>Texas Sam shot one rapid look of appraisement over the sleepy little
horse; then he laughed.</p>

<p>"Pinch me, Iron Jaw!" he cried; "am I ridin' on the tail board of an
overland bus seein' things in the desert, and hearin' wings?"</p>

<p>He pointed a forefinger at the buckskin. "Is that the lopin'
jack-rabbit that runs for your money?" he queried of Carney.</p>

<p>"That horse's name is Pat," Bulldog answered quietly, "and we've been
pals so long that when any yapping coyote snaps at him I most naturally
kick the brute out of the way. But that's the horse, Buckskin Pat, that
my money says can outrun, for a mile-and-a-quarter, the horse you
describe as a cow-hocked cow-pony, the same being, I take it, the horse
you scooted away on when I palmed you on the mouth this morning."</p>

<p>Texas Sam was naturally of a vicious temper, and this allusion caused
him to flare up again, as Carney meant it to. But Iron Jaw whirled him
around, saying:</p>

<p>"Cut out the man end of it&mdash;let's get down to cases. We ain't had
a live hoss race for so long that I most forget what it looks like. If
you two mean business come inside and put up your bets, gentlemen."</p>

<p>Iron Jaw abrogated to himself the duty of Master of Ceremonies. First
he set his croupier to work counting the gold of Texas Sam and Bulldog
Carney. There were an even hundred twenty-dollar gold pieces in the belt
Carney had thrown on the table.</p>

<p>"You're shy on the raise," Iron Jaw remarked, winking at Texas.</p>

<p>"I'll see his raise," the latter growled. "You've got more'n that of
mine in your safe, Iron Jaw, so stack 'em up for me till they're level. I
might as well win somethin' worth while&mdash;there won't be no fun in
the race. That jack&mdash;that buckskin,"&mdash;he checked
himself&mdash;"won't make me go fast enough to know I'm in the
saddle."</p>

<p>"You let me in that and I'll furnish the speed," Snaky Dick could not
resist the temptation to clutch at the money he saw slipping away from
him. "Make it a three-cornered sweep, Mr. Carney," he pleaded; "I'll
ante."</p>

<p>"It would be some race," Iron Jaw encouraged; "some race, boys. I've
seen the little buckskin amble. I don't know nothin' about this Texas
person's caravan, but Clatawa, for a sauce bottle that holds both warm
and cold blood, ain't so slow&mdash;he ain't so slow, gents."</p>

<p>The idea caught on; everybody in the saloon rose to the occasion.
Yells of, "Make it a sweep! Let Clatawa in! Wake up old Walla Walla with
something worth while!" came from many throats.</p>

<p>Bulldog seemed to debate the matter, a smile twitching his drab
mustache.</p>

<p>"I've said it," Texas cried; "she's wide open. Anybody that's got a
pet eagle he thinks can fly faster'n my cow-pony can run, can enter him.
There ain't no one barred, and the limit's up where the pines point
to."</p>

<p>Snaky Dick had edged around the table till he stood close beside
Bulldog, where he whispered: "Let me in, Carney; I've been layin' for
this flannel-mouth. I don't want to see him get away with Walla Walla
money. You save your stake with me, if I'm in."</p>

<p>Carney pushed the little wizzen-face speaker away, saying:</p>

<p>"Any kind of a talking bird can swing in on a winning if he's got a
copper-riveted, cinch bet. But sport, as I understand it, gentlemen,
consists in providing excitement, taking on long chances."</p>

<p>"That's Bulldog talkin'," somebody interrupted; and they all
cheered.</p>

<p>"That being acknowledged," Carney resumed, "I feel like stealing candy
from a blind kid when I crowd in on this Texas person. A yellow man
wouldn't know how to own a real horse; that money on the table is, so to
speak, mine now; but as Snaky Dick is panting to make it a real race,
purely out of a kindly feeling for Walla Walla sports, I'm going to let
him draw cards. Clatawa is welcome."</p>

<p>"The drinks is on the house when I hear a wolf howl like that!"
Snaggle Tooth yelled. "Crowd up, gentlemen&mdash;the drinks is on the
house! Old Walla Walla is goin' to sit up and take notice; Bulldog is
some live wire."</p>

<p>Chairs were thrust back; men crowded the bar; liquors were tossed off.
Sheriff Teddy the Leaper, who had come in, felt his arm touched by
Carney, and inclining his head to a gentle pull at his coatsleeve, he
heard the latter whisper, "Stake holder for my sake." That was all.</p>

<p>Then the crowd swarmed back to the table where the croupier had
remained beside the mound of gold.</p>

<p>"You give Jim, there, a receipt for a thousand, and he'll pass it
out," Iron Jaw told Texas.</p>

<p>Jim the croupier took from the safe behind him rolls of twenty-dollar
gold pieces and stood them up in Texas's pile. He removed a few coins,
saying, "The pot is right, gentlemen; two thousand apiece."</p>

<p>"Hold on," Snaky Dick cried; "it ain't closed yet&mdash;I draw
cards."</p>

<p>"Not till you see the bet and the raise," Carney objected. "Nobody
whispers his way into this game; it's for blood."</p>

<p>"Give me a cheque book, Snaggle Tooth," Snaky pleaded.</p>

<p>"Flimsies don't go," Carney objected.</p>

<p>"Nothin' but the coin weighs in agin me," Texas agreed; "put up the
dough-boys or keep out."</p>

<p>Snaky was in despair. Here was just the softest spot in all the world,
and without the cash he couldn't get in.</p>

<p>"Will you cash my cheque?" he asked Iron Jaw.</p>

<p>"If Baker'll O.K. it I figger you must have the stuff in his
bank&mdash;it'll be good enough for me," Iron Jaw replied.</p>

<p>There was a little parley between Snaky Dick, his associates, and
Baker, who was a private banker. The cheque was made out, endorsed, and
cashed from the gambling funds, Iron Jaw being a partner of Snaggle
Tooth's in this commercial enterprise.</p>

<p>When the pot was complete, six thousand on the table, Texas said:</p>

<p>"We've got to have a stakeholder; put the money in Blake's
hands&mdash;does that go?"</p>

<p>Snaky Dick coughed, and hesitated. He had no suspicion that Iron Jaw
had any interest with Texas Sam, but knowing the man as he did, he felt
sure that before the race was run Iron Jaw and Snaggle Tooth would be in
the game up to the eyes.</p>

<p>The drawling voice of Carney broke the little hush that followed this
request.</p>

<p>"You're from the outside, Texas; you know all about your own horse,
and that lets you out. The selecting of a stakeholder, and such, most
properly belongs to Walla Walla, that is to say, such of us interested as
more or less live here. The Sheriff of Shoshone, who is present, if he'll
oblige, is the man that holds my money, and yours, too, unless you want
to crawfish. Does that suit you, Snaky?"</p>

<p>"It does," the latter answered cheerfully, for, fully believing that
Clatawa was going to show a clean pair of heels to the other horses, he
wanted the money where he could get it without gun-play.</p>

<p>"That's settled, then," Carney said blithely, ignoring Texas
completely. He turned to Teddy the Leaper: "Will you oblige,
Sheriff?"</p>

<p>The Sheriff was agreeable, saying that as soon as they had completed
details they would take the money over to Baker's bank and lock it up in
the safe, Baker promising to take charge of it, even if it were at
night.</p>

<p>"Just repeat the conditions of the match," the Sheriff said, and he
drew from his pocket a note book and pencil.</p>

<p>Carney seized the opportunity to say:</p>

<p>"A three-cornered race between the buckskin gelding Pat, the black
gelding Horned Toad, and the bay horse Clatawa at one mile and a quarter.
The stake, two thousand dollars a corner; winner take all. To be run one
week from to-day."</p>

<p>"Is that right, gentlemen?" the Sheriff asked; "all agreed?"</p>

<p>"Owners up&mdash;this is a gentleman's race," Texas snapped.</p>

<p>"Satisfactory?" the Sheriff asked, his eyes on Carney.</p>

<p>The latter nodded; and Iron Jaw winked at Snaggle Tooth.</p>

<p>Snaky Dick could scarce credit his ears: surely the gods were looking
with favor upon his fortunes; the other riders would be giving him many
pounds in this self-accepted handicap.</p>

<p>At Sheriff Teddy's suggestion the gold was carried over to Baker's
bank, a stone building almost opposite the Del Monte; the bag containing
it was sealed and placed in a big safe, Baker giving the Sheriff a
receipt for six thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Then they went back to the Del Monte for target practise at the
bottle, each man implicated buying ammunition.</p>

<p>At this time Carney had taken the buckskin to his stable, going back
to the saloon.</p>

<p>Snaggle Tooth made a short patriotic speech, the burden of which was
that the saloon was full of men of eager habit who had not had a chance
to sit into the game, and to ameliorate the condition of these mournful
mavericks he would sell pools on the race, for the mere honorarium of
five per cent.</p>

<p>Fever was in the men's blood; if he had suggested twenty per cent it
would have gone.</p>

<p>Snaggle Tooth took up his position behind a faro table and called
out:</p>

<p>"The pool is open, with Clatawa, Horned Toad, and Pat in the box. What
am I bid for first choice?"</p>

<p>"Twenty dollars," a voice cried.</p>

<p>"Thirty," another said.</p>

<p>"Forty."</p>

<p>"Fifty."</p>

<p>A dry rasp that suggested an alkaline throat squeaked: "A hundred. Is
this a horse race, or are we dribblin' into the plate at the
synagogue?"</p>

<p>"Sold!" Snaggle Tooth yapped, knowing well that excitement begat quick
action. "Which cayuse do you favor, plunger?"</p>

<p>"The range horse, Clatawa."</p>

<p>The croupier at Snaggle Tooth's elbow took the bidder's five
twenty-dollar gold pieces and passed him a slip with Clatawa's name on
it.</p>

<p>"A hundred dollars in the box and second choice for sale," Snaggle
Tooth drawled, his prominent fang gleaming in the lamp light as he
mouthed the words.</p>

<p>Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty was bid like the quick popping of a
machine gun; at seventy-five the bids hung fire, and the auctioneer,
thumping the table with his bony fist, snapped, "Sold! Name your jack
rabbit."</p>

<p>"Horned Toad!" came from the bidder of the seventy-five.</p>

<p>"A hundred and seventy-five in the box," Snaggle Tooth droned, "and
the buckskin for sale. What about it, you pikers&mdash;what about
it?"</p>

<p>There seemed to be nothing about it, unless silence was something. The
hush seemed to dampen the gambling spirit.</p>

<p>"What!" yelped Snaggle Tooth; "two thousand golden bucks staked on the
horse now, and no tinhorn with sand enough in his gizzard to open his
trap. This is a race, not a funeral&mdash;who's dead? Bulldog, you laid
even money; here's a hundred and seventy-five goin' a-beggin'. Ain't you
got a chance?"</p>

<p>"Ten dollars!" Carney bid as if driven into it.</p>

<p>"Ten dollars, ten dollars bid for the buckskin; a hundred and
seventy-five in the box, and ten dollars bid for the buckskin. Sold!"</p>

<p>The first pool was followed by others, one after another: the roulette
table, the keno game, and faro were in the discard&mdash;their tables
were deserted.</p>

<p>It soon became evident that Clatawa was a hot favorite; the public's
money was all for the Walla Walla champion.</p>

<p>Noting this, the Horned Toad trio hung back, bidding less. Clatawa was
selling for a hundred, Horned Toad about fifty, and the buckskin
sometimes knocked down at ten to Carney, or sometimes bid up to twenty by
someone tempted by the odds.</p>

<p>At last Carney slipped quietly away, having bought at least twenty
pools that stood him between three and four thousand to a matter of two
hundred.</p>

<p>In the morning he rode the buckskin out to Molly's cottage and turned
him over to Billy.</p>

<p>The boy's voice trembled with delight when he was told of what had
taken place.</p>

<p>"Gee! now I will get well," he said; "I'll beat the bug out
now&mdash;-I'll have heart. You see, Mr. Carney, I got set down in
California a year ago. It wasn't my fault; I was ridin' for Timberleg
Harley, and he give the horse a bucket of water before the race; he
didn't want to win&mdash;was lettin' the horse run for Sweeney, layin'
for a big price later on. He had an interest in a book, and they took
liberties with the horse's odds&mdash;he was favorite. He didn't dare
tell me anything about it, the hound. When I found the horse couldn't
raise a gallop, hangin' in my hand like a sea lion, I didn't ride him
out, thinkin' he'd broke down. They had me up in the Judges' Stand, and
sent for the books. It looked bad. Timberleg got off by swearin' I'd
pulled the horse to let the other one win; swore that I stood in with the
book that overlaid him. I was give the gate, and it just broke my heart.
I was weak from wastin' anyway. And you can't beat the bug out if your
heart's soft; the bug'll win&mdash;it's a hundred-to-one on him. First
thing I'm goin' to give Waster a ball to clean him out, give him a bran
mash, too. He must be like a currycomb inside, grass and hay and
everything here is full of this damn cactus. A week ain't much to ready
up a horse for a race, but he ain't got no fat to work off, and he knows
the game. In a week he'll be as spry as a kitten. I'll just play with
him. I'll bunk with him, too. If Slimy Red got wise to anything he'd slip
him a twig of locoe, or put a sponge up his nose. Do you know what that
thief did once, Mr. Carney? He was a moonlighter; he sneaked the favorite
for a race that was to be run next day out of his stall at night and
galloped him four miles with about a hundred and sixty in the saddle.
That settled the favorite; he run his race same's if he was pullin' a
hearse.</p>

<p>"That's a good idea, Billy. There's half-a-dozen Slimy Reds in Walla
Walla: it's a good idea, only I'll do the sleeping with the buckskin. I'd
be lonesome away from him."</p>

<p>The boy objected, but Carney was firm.</p>

<p>Billy was not only a good rider, but he was a man of much brains.
There was little of the art of training that he did not know, for his
father had been a trainer before him&mdash;he had been brought up in a
stable.</p>

<p>Fortunately the buckskin's working life had left little to be desired
in the way of conditioning; it was just that the sinews and muscles might
have become case-hardened, more the muscles of endurance than
activity.</p>

<p>But then the race was over a distance, a mile-and-a-quarter, where the
endurance of the thoroughbred would tell over Clatawa. Indeed, full of
the contempt which a racing man has for a cold-blooded horse, Billy did
not consider Clatawa in the race at all.</p>

<p>"That part of it is just found money," he assured Carney. "Clatawa
will go off with a burst of speed like those Texas half-milers, and he'll
commence to die at the mile; he hasn't a chance."</p>

<p>As to Ding Dong it was simply a question of whether the black had
improved and Waster gone back enough, through being thrown out of
training, to bring the two together. Anywhere near alike in condition
Waster was a fourteen-pound better horse than Ding Dong. It might be that
now, his legs sounder than they had ever been when he was racing, Waster
might run the best mile-and-a-quarter of his life.</p>

<p>Of course this might not be possible in a three-quarter sprint, for,
at that terrific rate of going, running it from end to end at top speed,
a certain nervous or muscular system would be called upon that had
practically become atrophied through the more leisure ways of the trail
work.</p>

<p>The little man pondered over these many things just as a man of
commerce might mentally canvas great markets, conveying his point of view
to Carney generally. He would map out the race as they sat together in
the evening.</p>

<p>"Of course Snaky Dick will shoot out from the crack of the pistol, and
try to open up a gap that'll break our hearts. He won't dare to pull
Clatawa in behind; a cold-blooded horse's got the heart of a
chicken&mdash;he'd quit. Slimy'll carry Ding Dong along at a rate he
knows will leave him enough for a strong run home; but he'll think that
he's only got Clatawa to beat and he'll pull out of his pace&mdash;he'll
keep within strikin' distance of Clatawa. I'll let them go on. I know
'bout how fast Waster can run that mile-and-a-quarter from end to end.
Don't you worry if you see me ten lengths out of it at the mile. Waster
won all his races comin' through his horses from behind&mdash;'cause he's
game. When Clatawa cracks, and I'm not up, Slimy'll stop ridin' he'll let
his horse down thinkin' he's won. You'll see, Mr. Carney. If a
quarter-of-a-mile from the finish post I'm within three lengths of Ding
Dong and not drivin' him you can take all the money in sight. I'll tell
you somethin' else, Mr. Carney; if I'm up with Ding Dong, and Slimy Red
thinks I've got him, he'll try a foul."</p>

<p>"Glad you mentioned it, little man," Carney remarked drily.</p>

<p>The buckskin was given a long steady gallop the day after he had
received the ball of physic; then for three days he was given short
sprinting runs and a little practise at breaking from the gun. Two days
before the race he was given a mile and a quarter at a little under full
speed; rated as though he were in a race, the last half a topping gallop.
He showed little distress, and cleaned up his oats an hour later after he
had been cooled out. Billy was in an ecstasy of happy content.</p>

<p>Nobody who was a judge of a horse's pace had seen Waster gallop his
trial over the full course, for the boy had arranged it cleverly. Texas
Sam and Snaky Dick both worked their horses in the morning, and sometimes
gave them a slow gallop in the evening. Billy knew that at the first peep
of day some of the Clatawa people would be on the track, so he waited
that morning until everybody had gone home to breakfast, thinking all the
gallops were over; then he slipped on to the course and covered the
mile-and-a-quarter without being seen.</p>

<p>The course was a straightaway, one hundred feet wide, lying outside of
the town on the open plain, and running parallel to the one long street.
The finish post was opposite the heart of the town.</p>

<p>The week was one long betting carnival; one heard nothing but betting
jargon. It was horse morning, noon, and night.</p>

<p>Carney had acquired another riding horse, and the Horned Toad cabal
laughed cynically at his seriousness. Iron Jaw could not understand it,
for Bulldog had a reputation for cleverness; but here he was acting like
a tenderfoot. Once or twice a suspicion flashed across his mind that
perhaps Bulldog had discovered something, and meant to call them after
they had won the race. But there was Clatawa; there was nothing to cover
up in his case, and surely Carney didn't think he could beat the bay with
his buckskin. Besides they weren't racing under Jockey Club rules. They
hadn't guaranteed anything; Carney had matched his horse against the
black, and there he was; names didn't count&mdash;the horse was the
thing.</p>

<p>Molly had heard about the match and had grown suspicious over Billy's
active participation, fearing it might bring on a hemorrhage if he rode a
punishing race. When she taxed Billy with this he pleaded so hard for a
chance to help out, assuring Molly that Waster would run his own race,
and would need little help from him, that she yielded. When she talked to
Bulldog about it he told her he was going to give the whole stake to
Billy, the four thousand, if he won it.</p>

<p>And then came the day of the great match. From the time the first
golden shafts of sunlight had streamed over the Bitter Root Mountains,
picking out the forms of Walla Walla's structures, that looked so like a
mighty pack of wolves sleeping in the plain, till well on into the
afternoon, the border town had been in a ferment. What mattered whether
there was gold in the Coeur d'Alene or not; whether the Nez Perces were
good Presbyterians under the leadership, physically, of Chief Joseph, and
spiritually, Missionary Mackay, was of no moment. A man lay cold in
death, a plug of lead somewhere in his chest, the result of a gambling
row, but the morrow would be soon enough to investigate; to-day was the
day&mdash;-the day of the race; minor business was suspended.</p>

<p>It made men thirsty this hot, parching anticipation; women had a
desire for finery. Doors stood open, for the dwellers could not sit, but
prowled in and out, watching the slow, loitering clock hands for four
o'clock.</p>

<p>One phrase was on everybody's lips: "I'll take that bet."</p>

<p>Numerically the followers of Clatawa were in the majority; but there
was a weight of metal behind Horned Toad that steadied the market; it
came from a mysterious source. Texas Sam had been played for a blatant
fool; nobody had seen Horned Toad show a performance that would warrant
backing.</p>

<p>The little buckskin was looked upon as a sacrifice to his owner's
well-known determination, his wild gambling spirit, that once roused,
could not be bluffed. They pitied Carney because they liked him; but what
was the use of stringing with a man who held the weakest hand? And yet
when somebody, growing rash, offered ten to one against the buckskin, a
man, quite as calm and serene as Bulldog Carney himself, looking like a
placer miner who worked a rocker on some bend of the Columbia, would say,
diffidently, "I'll take that bet." And he would make good&mdash;one
yellow eagle or fifty. It was almost ominous, the quiet seriousness of
this man who said his name was Oregon, just Oregon.</p>

<p>"Talk of gamblers," Iron Jaw said with a spluttering laugh, and he
pointed to the street where little knots of people stood, close packed
against some two, who, money in hand, were backing their faith. Then the
fatty laugh chilled into a cold-blooded sneer:</p>

<p>"Snaggle Tooth, we'll learn these tin-horns somethin'; tomorrow your
safe won't be big enough to hold it. But, say, don't let that Texas
brayin' ass have no more booze."</p>

<p>"If you ask me, Blake, I think he's yeller. He's plumb babyfied now
because of Carney&mdash;sober he'd quit."</p>

<p>"Carney won't turn a hair when we win."</p>

<p>"Course he won't. But you can't get that into Texas's noodle with a
funnel&mdash;he's hoodooed; wants me to plant a couple of gun men at the
finish for fear Bulldog'll grab him."</p>

<p>"Look here, Snaggle, that coyote&mdash;hell! I know the breed of them
outlaws, they'd rather win a race crooked than by their horse gallopin'
in front&mdash;he just can't trust himself; he's afraid he'll foul the
others when the chance flashes on him. You just tell him that we can't
stand to kiss twenty thousand good-bye because of any Injun trick; the
Sheriff wouldn't stand for it for a minute; he'd turn the money over to
the horse that he thought ought to get it, quick as a wolf'd grab a calf
by the throat."</p>

<p>That was the atmosphere on that sweet-breathed August day in the
archaic town of Walla Walla.</p>

<p>It was a perfectly conceived race; three men in it and each one
confident that he held a royal flush; each one certain that, bar crooked
work, he could win.</p>

<p>The sporting Commandant of the U.S. Cavalry troop had been appointed
judge of the finish at the Sheriff's suggestion; and another officer was
to fire the starting gun.</p>

<p>It was a springy turf course; just the going to suit Waster, whose
legs had been dicky. On a hard course, built up of clay and sand,
guiltless of turf, the fierce hammering of the hoofs might even yet heat
up his joints, though they looked sound; his clutching hoofs might cup
out unrooted earth and bow a tendon.</p>

<p>An hour before race time people had flocked out to the goal where
would be settled the ownership of thousands of dollars by the gallant
steed that first caught the judge's eye as he flashed past the post. Even
Lieutenant Governor Moore was there; that magnificent Nez Perces, Chief
Joseph, sat his half-blooded horse a six-foot-three bronze Apollo, every
inch a king in his beaded buckskins and his eagle feathers. The picture
was Homeric, grand; and behind the canvas was the subtle duplicity of
gold worshipers.</p>

<p>At half-past three a hush fell over the chattering, betting,
vociferating throng, as the judge, a tall soldierly figure of a man,
called:</p>

<p>"Bring out the horses for this race: it is time to go to the
post!"</p>

<p>Clatawa was the first to push from behind the throng to the course
where the judge stood. He was a beautiful, high-spirited bay with black
points, and a broad line of white, starting from a star in his forehead,
ran down his somewhat Roman nose. Two men led him, one on either side,
and a blanket covered his form.</p>

<p>Then Horned Toad was led forward by a stable man; beneath a loose
blanket showed the outlines of a small saddle. The horse walked with the
unconcerned step of one accustomed to crowds, and noise, and blare.
Beside him strode Texas Sam, a long coat draping his form.</p>

<p>Behind Horned Toad came the buckskin, at his heels Bulldog Carney, and
beside Carney a figure that might have been an eager boy out for the
holiday. The buckskin walked with the same indifference Horned Toad had
shown.</p>

<p>As he was brought to a stand he lifted his long lean neck, threw up
the flopped ears, spread his nostrils, and with big bright eyes gazed far
down the track, so like a huge ribbon laid out on the plain, as if
wondering where was the circular course he loved so well. He knew it was
a race&mdash;that he was going to battle with those of his own kind. The
tight cinching of the little saddle on his back, the bandages on his
shins, the sponging out of his mouth, the little sprinting gallops he had
had&mdash;all these touches had brought back to his memory the game his
rich warm, thoroughbred blood loved. His very tail was arched with the
thrill of it.</p>

<p>"Mount your horses; it is time to go to the post!" Judge Cummings
called, watch in hand.</p>

<p>The blanket was swept from Clatawa's back, showing nothing but a wide,
padded surcingle, with a little pocket either side for his rider's feet.
And Snaky Dick, dropping his coat, stood almost as scantily attired; a
pair of buckskin trunks being the only garment that marked his brown,
monkey-like form.</p>

<p>Horned Toad carried a racing saddle, and from a shaffle bit the reins
ran through the steel rings of a martingale.</p>

<p>At this Carney smiled, and more than one in the crowd wondered at this
get-up for a supposed cow-pony.</p>

<p>Then when Texas threw his long coat to a stable man, and stood up a
slim lath of a man, clad in light racing boots, thin white tight-fitting
racing breeches and a loose silk jacket, people stared again. It was as
if, by necromancy, he had suddenly wasted from off his bones forty pounds
of flesh.</p>

<p>But there was still further magic waiting the curious throng, for now
the buckskin, stripped of his blanket, showed atop his well-ribbed back a
tiny matter of pigskin that looked like a huge postage stamp. And the
little figure of a man, one foot in Carney's hand, was lifted lightly to
the saddle, where he sat in attire the duplicate of Texas Sam's.</p>

<p>With a bellow of rage Iron Jaw pushed forward, crying:</p>

<p>"Hold, there! What the' hell are you doin' on that horse, you damn
runt? Get down!"</p>

<p>He reached a huge paw to the rider's thigh, as though he would yank
him out of the saddle.</p>

<p>His fingers had scarce touched the boy's leg when his hands were
thrown up in the air, and he reeled back from a scimitar-like cut on his
wind-pipe from the flat open hand of Carney, and choking, sputtering an
oath of raging astonishment, he found himself looking into the bore of a
gun, and heard a voice that almost hissed in its constrained passion:</p>

<p>"You coarse butcher! You touch that boy and you'll wake up in hell.
Now stand back and make to Judge Cummings any complaint you have."</p>

<p>Snaggle Tooth and Death-on-the-trail had pushed to Iron Jaw's side,
their hands on their guns, and Carney, full of a passion rare with him,
turned on them:</p>

<p>"Draw, if you want that, or lift your hands, damn quick!"</p>

<p>Surlily they dropped their half-drawn guns back into their pig-skin
pockets. And Oregon, who had thrust forward, drew close to the two and
said something in a low voice that brought a bitter look of hatred into
the face of Snaggle Tooth.</p>

<p>But Oregon looked him in the eye and said audibly: "That's the last
call to chuck&mdash;don't forget."</p>

<p>Iron Jaw was now appealing to the judge:</p>

<p>"This match was for owners up."</p>

<p>He beckoned forward the stakeholder:</p>

<p>"Ain't that so, Sheriff&mdash;owners up?"</p>

<p>"That was the agreement," Teddy sustained.</p>

<p>"Wasn't that the bargain, Carney?" Iron Jaw asked, turning on
Bulldog.</p>

<p>"It was."</p>

<p>"Then what the' hell 're you doin' afoot&mdash;and that monkey up?"
And Iron Jaw jerked a thumb viciously over his shoulder at the little man
on Waster.</p>

<p>Carney's head lifted, and the bony contour of his lower jaw thrust out
like the ram of a destroyer:</p>

<p>"Mr. Blake," he said quietly, "don't use any foul words when you speak
to me&mdash;we're not good enough pals for that; if you do I'll ram those
crooked teeth of yours down your throat. Secondly, that's the owner of
the buckskin sitting on his back. But the owner of Horned Toad is sitting
in a chair down in Portland, a man named Reilly, and that thing on Ding
Dong's back is Slimy Red, a man who has been warned off every track in
the West. He doesn't own a hair in the horse's tail."</p>

<p>Iron Jaw's face paled with a sudden compelling thought that Carney,
knowing all this, and still betting his money, held cards to beat
him.</p>

<p>The judge now asked: "Do you object to the rider of Horned Toad, Mr.
Carney?"</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;let him ride. I'm not trying to win their money on a
technicality, but on a horse."</p>

<p>"Well, the agreement was owners up, you admit?"</p>

<p>"I do," Carney answered.</p>

<p>"Did this boy on the buckskin's back own him when the match was
made?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"Is there any proof of the transaction, the sale?" Major Cummings
asked.</p>

<p>"Let me have that envelope I asked you to keep," Carney said,
addressing the sheriff.</p>

<p>When Teddy drew from a pocket the sealed envelope, Carney tore it
open, and passed to the judge the bill of sale to MacKay of the buckskin.
Its date showed that it had been executed the day the match was made, and
Teddy, when questioned, said he had received it on that date, and before
the match was made.</p>

<p>"It was a plant," Iron Jaw objected; "that proves it. Why did he put
it in the sheriff's hands&mdash;why didn't the boy keep it&mdash;it was
his?"</p>

<p>"Because I had a hunch I was going up against a bunch of crooks,"
Carney answered suavely; "crooks who played win, tie, or wrangle, and
knew they would claim the date was forged when they were beat at their
own game. And there was another reason."</p>

<p>Carney drew a second paper from the envelope, and passed it to the
Judge. It was a brief note stating that if anything happened to Carney
his money, if the buckskin won, was to be turned over to the owner, Billy
MacKay.</p>

<p>When the judge lifted his eyes Carney said, with an apologetic little
smile: "You see, the boy's got the bug, and he's up against it. Molly
Burdan is keeping both him and his sister, and she can't afford it."</p>

<p>Major Cummings coughed; and there was a little husky rasp in his voice
as he said, quietly:</p>

<p>"The objection to the rider of the buckskin horse is disallowed. This
paper proves he is the legitimate owner and entitled to ride. Go down to
the post."</p>

<p>A yell of delight went up from many throats. The men of Walla Walla,
and the riders of the plains who had trooped in, were sports; they
grasped the idea that the gambling clique had been caught at their own
game; that the intrepid Bulldog had put one over on them. Besides, now
they could see that the race was for blood. The heavy betting had started
more than one whisper that perhaps it was a bluff; some of the Clatawa
people believing in the invincibility of their horse, had hinted that
perhaps there was a job on for the two other horses to foul Clatawa and
one of them go on and win; though few would admit that Carney would be
party to cold-decking the public.</p>

<p>But accident had thrown the cards all on the table; it was to be a
race to the finish, and the stakes represented real money.</p>

<p>Before they could start quite openly Carney stepped close to the rider
of Horned Toad, and said, in even tones:</p>

<p>"Slimy Red, if you pull any dirty work I'll be here at the finish
waiting for you. If you can win, win; but ride straight, or you'll never
ride again."</p>

<p>"I'll be hangin' round the finish post, too," Oregon muttered
abstractedly, but both Iron Jaw and Snaggle Tooth could hear him.</p>

<p>The three horses passed down the course, Clatawa sidling like a boat
in a choppy sea, champing at his bit irritably, flecks of white froth
snapping from his lips, and his tail twitching and swishing, indicating
his excitable temperament; Horned Toad and Waster walked with that
springy lift to the pasterns that indicated the perfection of breeding.
Indians and cowboys raced up and down the plain, either side of the
course, on their ponies, bandying words in a very ecstasy of delight. Old
Walla Walla had come into its own; the greatest sport on earth was on in
all its glory.</p>

<p>After a time the three horses were seen to turn far down the course;
they criss-crossed, and wove in and out a few times as they were being
placed by the starter. The excitable Clatawa was giving trouble;
sometimes he reared straight up; then, with a few bucking jumps, fought
for his head. But the sinewy Snaky Dick was always his master.</p>

<p>Atop the little buckskin the boy was scarce discernible at that
distance, as he sat low crouched over his horse's wither. Almost like an
equine statue stood Waster, so still, so sleepy-like, that those who had
taken long odds about him felt a depression.</p>

<p>Horned Toad was scarcely still for an instant; his wary rider, Texas,
was keeping him on his toes&mdash;not letting him chill out; but, like
the buckskin's jockey, his eye was always on the man with the gun. They
were old hands at the game, both of them; they paid little attention to
the antics of Clatawa&mdash;the starter was the whole works.</p>

<p>Clatawa had broken away to be pulled up in thirty yards. Now, as he
came back, his wily rider wheeled him suddenly short of the starting
line, and the thing that he had cunningly planned came off. The starter,
finger on trigger, was mentally pulled out of himself by this; his finger
gripped spasmodically; those at the finish post saw a puff of smoke, and
a white-nosed horse, well out in front, off to a flying start.</p>

<p>The backers of Clatawa yelled in delight.</p>

<p>"Good old Snaky Dick!" some one cried.</p>

<p>"Clatawa beat the gun!" another roared.</p>

<p>"They'll never catch him!&mdash;never catch him! He'll win off by
himself!" was droned.</p>

<p>Behind, seemingly together, half the width of the track separating
them, galloped the black and the buckskin. It looked as if Waster raced
alone, as if he had lost his rider, so low along his wither and neck lay
the boy, his weight eased high from the short stirrups. A hand on either
side of the lean neck, he seemed a part of his mount. He was saying,
"Ste-a-dy boy! stead-d-dy boy! stead-d-dy boy!" a soft, low monotonous
sing-song through his clinched teeth, his crouch discounting the handicap
of a strong wind that was blowing down the track.</p>

<p>He could feel the piece of smooth-moving machinery under him flatten
out in a long rhythmic stride, and his heart sank, for he knew it was the
old Waster he had ridden to victory more than once; that same powerful
stride that ate up the course with little friction. He was rating his
horse. "Clatawa will come back," he kept thinking: "Clatawa will come
back!"</p>

<p>He himself, who had ridden hundreds of races, and working gallops and
trials beyond count, knew that the chestnut was rating along of his own
knowledge at a pace that would cover the mile-and-a-quarter in under
2.12. Methodically he was running his race. Clatawa was sprinting; he had
cut out at a gait that would carry him a mile, if he could keep it up,
close to 1.40. Too fast, for the track was slow, being turf.</p>

<p>He watched Horned Toad; that was what he had to beat, he knew.</p>

<p>Texas had reasoned somewhat along the same lines; but his brain was
more flighty. As Clatawa opened a gap of a dozen lengths, running like a
wild horse, Texas grew anxious; he shook up his mount and increased his
pace.</p>

<p>The buckskin reached into his bridle at this, as though he coaxed for
a little more speed, but the boy called, "Steady, lad, steady!" and let
Horned Toad creep away a length, two lengths; and always in front the
white-faced horse, Clatawa, was galloping on and on with a high deer-like
lope that was impressive.</p>

<p>At the finish post people were acclaiming the name of Clatawa. They
could see the little buckskin trailing fifteen lengths behind, and Horned
Toad was between the two.</p>

<p>Carney watched the race stoically. It was being run just as Billy had
forecasted; there was nothing in this to shake his faith.</p>

<p>Somebody cried out: "Buckskin's out of it! I'll lay a thousand to a
hundred against him."</p>

<p>"I'll take it," Carney declared.</p>

<p>"I'll lay the same," Snaggle Tooth yelled.</p>

<p>"You're on," came from Carney.</p>

<p>And even as they bet the buckskin had lost a length.</p>

<p>Half-a-mile had been covered by the horses; three-quarters; and now it
seemed to the watchers that the black was creeping up on Clatawa, the
latter's rider, who had been almost invisible, riding Indian fashion
lying along the back of his horse, was now in view; his shoulders were
up. Surely a quirt had switched the air once.</p>

<p>Yes, the Toad was creeping up&mdash;his rider was making his run; they
could see Texas's arms sway as he shook up his mount.</p>

<p>Why was the boy on the little buckskin riding like one asleep? Had he
lost his whip&mdash;had he given up all idea of winning?</p>

<p>They were at the mile: but a short quarter away. A moan went up from
many throats, mixed with hoarse curses, for Clatawa was plainly in
trouble; he was floundering; the monkey man on his back was playing the
quirt against his ribs, the gyrations checking the horse instead of
helping him.</p>

<p>And the Toad, galloping true and straight, was but a length
behind.</p>

<p>Watching this battle, almost in hushed silence, gasping in the
smothered tenseness, the throng went mentally blind to the little
buckskin. Now somebody cried:</p>

<p>"God! look at the other one comin'! Look at him&mdash;lo-ook at him,
men!"</p>

<p>His voice ran up the scale to a shrill scream. Other eyes lengthened
their vision, and their owners gasped.</p>

<p>Clatawa seemed to be running backwards, so fast the little buckskin
raced by him as he dropped out of it, beaten.</p>

<p>And Horned Toad was but three lengths in front now. Three lengths? It
was two&mdash;it was one. Now the buckskin's nose rose and fell on the
black's quarters; now the mouse-coloured muzzle was at his girth; now
their heads rose and fell together, as, stride for stride, they battled
for the lead: Texas driving his mount with whip and spur, cutting the
flanks of his horse with cruel blows in a frantic endeavor to lift him
home a winner.</p>

<p>How still the boy sat Waster; how well he must know that he had the
race won to nurse him like a babe. No swaying of the body to throw him
out of stride; no flash of the whip to startle him&mdash;to break his
heart; the brave little horse was doing it all himself. And the boy,
creature of brains, was wise enough to sit still.</p>

<p>They could hear the pound of hoofs on the turf like the beat of twin
drums; they could see the eager strife in the faces of the two brave,
stout-hearted thoroughbreds: and then the buckskin's head nod- ding in
front; his lean neck was clear of the black and he was galloping straight
as an arrow.</p>

<p>"The Toad is beat!" went up from a dozen throats. "The buckskin
wins&mdash;the buckskin wins!" became a clamor.</p>

<p>Pandemonium broke loose. It was stilled by a demoniac cry, a curse,
from some strong-voiced man. The black had swerved full in on to the
buckskin; they saw Texas clutch at the rider. Curses; cries of "Foul!"
rose; it was an angry roar like caged animals at war.</p>

<p>Carney, watching, found his fingers rubbing the butt of his gun. The
buckskin had been thrown out of his stride in the collision: he stumbled;
his head shot down&mdash;almost to his knees he went: then he was
galloping again, the two horses locked together.</p>

<p>Fifty feet away from the finish post they were locked: twenty
feet.</p>

<p>The cries of the throng were hushed; they scarce breathed.</p>

<p>Locked together they passed the post, the buckskin's neck in front.
Their speed had been checked; in a dozen yards they were stopped, and the
boy pitched headlong from the buckskin's back, one foot still tangled in
the martingale of Horned Toad.</p>

<p>Men closed in frantically. A man&mdash;it was Oregon&mdash;twisted
Carney's gun skyward crying: "Leave that coyote to the boys."</p>

<p>He was right. In vain Iron Jaw and Death-on-the-trail sought to battle
back the tense-faced men who reached for Texas. Iron Jaw and
Death-on-the-trail were swallowed up in a seething mass of clamoring
devils. Gun play was out of the question: humans were like herrings
packed in a barrel.</p>

<p>Major Cummings, cool and quick-witted, had called shrilly "Troopers!"
and a little cordon of men in cavalry uniform had Texas in the centre of
a guarding circle.</p>

<p>Carney, on his knees beside the boy, was guarding the lad from the
mad, trampling, fighting men; striking with the butt of his pistol. And
then a woman's shrill voice rose clear above the tumult, crying:</p>

<p>"Back, you cowards&mdash;you brutes: the boy is dying: give him
room&mdash;give him air!"</p>

<p>Her bleached hair was down her back; her silk finery was torn like a
battered flag; for she had fought her way through the crowd to the boy's
side.</p>

<p>"Don't lift him&mdash;he's got a hemorrhage!" she shrilled, as Carney
put his arms beneath the little lad. "Drive the men back&mdash;give him
air!" she commanded; and turned Billy flat on his back, tearing from her
shoulders a rich scarf to place beneath his head. The lad's lips, coated
with red froth, twitched in a weak smile; he reached out a thin hand, and
Molly, sitting at his head, drew it into her lap.</p>

<p>"Just lie still, Billy. You'll be all right, boy; just lie still;
don't speak," she admonished.</p>

<p>She could hear the lad's throat click, click, click at each breath,
the ominous tick tick, of "the bug's" work; and at each half-stifled
cough the red-tinged yeasty sputum bubbled up from the life well.</p>

<p>The fighting clamor was dying down; shame-faced men were widening the
circle about the lad and Molly.</p>

<p>The judge's voice was heard saying:</p>

<p>"The buckskin won the race, gentlemen." And he added, strong
condemnation in his voice: "If Horned Toad had been first I would have
disqualified him: it was a deliberate foul."</p>

<p>The cavalry men had got Texas away, mounted, and rushed him out to the
barracks for protection.</p>

<p>"Get a stretcher, someone, please," Molly asked of the crowd. "Billy
will be all right, but we must keep him flat on his back.</p>

<p>"You'll be all right, Billy," she added, bending her head till her
lips touched the boy's forehead, and her mass of peroxided hair hid the
hot tears that fell from the blue eyes that many thought only capable of
cupidity and guile.</p>
