<p class="quote">The first pioneers who settled among the rocks and sage and the stunted cedars and huge, gray hills of Idaho came by ox-cart and on foot. It was no place for weak-souled or weak-bodied men and women. It was no place for those who dreamed of money fortunes. The tough and keen-eyed men and women who stayed knew they were there to carve a home, however modest, out of the inhospitable land, and they built their log cabins and raised their children amid a ceaseless struggle to keep their stomachs fill and their bodies fit.</p>

<p class="quote">But even in that sparsely-populated, pioneer land there were some who couldn't play the game straight; there were some who found it necessary to fight to uphold their ideals and their property; there were some who found romance. This is the story of a few of them; Billy Louise, whose whole young life had been spent along the banks of the Wolverine; Ward Warren, who was making a lonely comeback; Charlie Fox, fresh from a job in an Eastern bank; Samuel Seabeck, whose principles, both business and moral, made him hate rustlers; and a handful of others.
</p>

<p class="quote">The story of these people is a story of the development of the American West. It is also the story of things which mattered to the pioneers; their land and cattle; their friends and lovers; their enemies, both human and animal.

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; LET US START AT THE BEGINNING</h2>

  <p class="first">FOUR trail-worn oxen, their necks bowed to the yoke of
  patient servitude, should really begin this story. But to follow the trail
  they made would take several chapters which you certainly would
  skip&mdash;unless you like to hear the tale of how the wilderness was tamed
  and can thrill at the stern history of those who did the taming while they
  fought to keep their stomachs fairly well filled with food and their
  hard-muscled bodies fit for the fray.</p>

  <p>There was a woman, low-browed, uncombed, harsh of voice and speech and
  nature, who drove the four oxen forward over lava rock and rough prairie and
  the scanty sage. I might tell you a great deal about Marthy, who plodded
  stolidly across the desert and the low-lying hills along the Blackfoot; and
  of her weak-souled, shiftless husband whom she called Jase, when she did not
  call him worse.</p>

  <p>They were the pioneers whose lurching wagon first forded the singing
  Wolverine stream just where it greens the tiny valley and then slips between
  huge lava-rock ledges to join the larger stream. Jase would have stopped
  there and called home the sheltered little green spot in the gray barrenness.
  But Marthy went on, up the farther hill and across the upland, another full
  day's journey with the sweating oxen.</p>

  <p>They camped that night on another little, singing stream, in another
  little valley, which was not so level or so green or so wholly pleasing to
  the eye. And that night two of the oxen, impelled by a surer instinct than
  their human owners, strayed away down a narrow, winding gorge and so
  discovered the Cove and feasted upon its rich grasses. It was Marthy who went
  after them and who recognized the little, hidden Eden as the place of her
  dreams&mdash;supposing she ever had dreams. So Marthy and Jase and the four
  oxen took possession, and with much labor and many hard years for the woman,
  and with the same number of years and as little labor as he could manage on
  the man's part, they tamed the Cove and made it a beauty spot in that wild
  land. A beauty spot, though their lives held nothing but treadmill toil and
  harsh words and a mental horizon narrowed almost to the limits of the grim,
  gray, rock wall that surrounded them.</p>

  <p>Another sturdy-souled couple came afterwards and saw the Wolverine and
  made for themselves a home upon its banks. And in the rough little log cabin
  was born the girl-child I want you to meet; a girl-child when she should have
  been a boy to meet her father's need and great desire; a girl-child whose
  very name was a compromise between the parents. For they called her Billy for
  sake of the boy her father wanted, and Louise for the girl her mother had
  longed for to lighten that terrible loneliness which the far frontier brings
  to the women who brave its stern emptiness.</p>

  <p>Do you like children? In other words, are you human? Then I want you to
  meet Billy Louise when she was ten and had lived all her life among the rocks
  and the sage and the stunted cedars and huge, gray hills of Idaho. Meet her
  with her pink sunbonnet hanging down the back of her neck and her big eyes
  taking in the squalidness of Marthy's crude kitchen in the Cove, and her
  terrible directness of speech hitting squarely the things she saw that were
  different from her own immaculate home. Of course, if you don't care for
  children, you may skip a chapter and meet her later when she was
  eighteen&mdash;but I really wish you would consent to know her at ten.</p>

  <p>"Mommie makes cookies with a raising in the middle. She gives me two
  sometimes when the Bill of me has been workin' like the deuce with dad; one
  for Billy and one for Louise. When I'm twelve, Mommie's goin' to let the
  Louise of me make cookies all myself and put a raising on top. I'll put two
  on top of one and bring it over for you, Marthy. And&mdash;" Billy Louise was
  terribly outspoken at times&mdash;"I'll put four raisings on another one for
  Jase, 'cause he don't have any nice times with you. Don't you ever make
  cookies with raisings on 'em, Marthy? I'm hungry as a coyote&mdash;and I
  ain't used to eating just bread and the kinda butter you have. Mom says you
  don't work it enough. She says you are too scared of water, and the
  buttermilk ain't all worked out, so that's why it tastes so funny. Does Jase
  like that kind of butter, Marthy?"</p>

  <p>"If your mother had to do the outside work as well as the inside, mebbe
  she wouldn't work her butter so awful much, either. I dunno whether Jase
  likes it or not. He eats it," Marthy stated grimly.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise sighed. "Well, of course he's awful lazy. Daddy says so. I
  guess I won't put but one raising on Jase's cookie when I'm twelve. Has Jase
  gone fishing again, Marthy?"</p>

  <p>A gleam of satisfaction brightened Marthy's hard, blue eyes. "No, he
  ain't. He's in the root suller. You want some bread and some nice, new honey,
  Billy Louise? I jest took it outa the hive this morning. When you go home,
  I'll send some to your maw if you can carry it."</p>

  <p>"Sure! I can carry anything that's good. If you put it on thick, so I
  can't taste the bread, I'll eat it. Say, you like me, don't you, Marthy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Marthy, turning her back on the slim, wide-eyed girl, "I like
  yuh, Billy Louise."</p>

  <p>"You sound like you wish you didn't," Billy Louise remarked. Even at ten
  Billy Louise was keenly sensitive to tones and glances and that intangible
  thing we call atmosphere. "Are you sorry you like me?"</p>

  <p>"No-o, I ain't sorry. A person's got to like something that's alive and
  human, or&mdash;" Marthy was clumsy with words, and she was always coming to
  the barrier between her powers of expression and the thoughts that were
  prisoned and dumb. "Here's your bread 'n' honey."</p>

  <p>"What makes you sound that way, Marthy? You sound like you had tears
  inside, and they couldn't get out your eyes. Are you sad? Did you ever have a
  little girl, Marthy?"</p>

  <p>"What makes you ask that?" Marthy sat heavily down upon a box beside the
  rough kitchen table and looked at Billy Louise queerly, as if she were half
  afraid of her.</p>

  <p>"I dunno&mdash;but that's the way mommie sounds when she says something
  about angel-brother. Did you ever&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Billy Louise, I'm going to tell you this oncet, and then I don't want you
  to ast me any more questions, nor talk about it. You're the queerest young
  one I ever seen, but you don't hurt folks on purpose&mdash;I've learnt that
  much about yuh." Marthy half rose from the box, and with her dingy, patched
  apron shooed an investigative hen out of the doorway. She knew that Billy
  Louise was regarding her fixedly over the huge, uneven slice of bread and
  honey, and she felt vaguely that a child's grave, inquiring eyes may be the
  hardest of all eyes to meet.</p>

  <p>"I never meant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know yuh never, Billy Louise. Now don't tell your maw this. Long
  ago&mdash;long before your maw ever found you, or your paw ever found your
  ranch on the Wolverine, I had a little girl, 'bout like you. She was a purty
  child&mdash;her hair was like silk, and her eyes was blue, and&mdash;we was
  Mormons, and we lived down clost to Salt Lake. And I seen so much misery
  amongst the women-folks&mdash;you can't understand that, but mebby you will
  when you grow up. Anyway, when little Minervy kep' growin' purtyer and
  sweeter, I couldn't stand it to think of her growin' up and bein' a Mormon's
  wife. I seen so many purty girls... So I made up my mind we'd move away off
  somewheres, where Minervy could grow up jest as sweet and purty as she was a
  mind to, and not have to suffer fer her sweetness and her purtyness. When you
  grow up, Billy Louise, you'll know what I mean. So me and Jase packed
  up&mdash;we kinda had to do it on the sly, on account uh the
  bishops&mdash;and we struck out with a four-ox team.</p>

  <p>"We kep' a-goin' and kep' a-goin', fer I was scared to settle too clost. I
  seen how they keep spreadin' out all the time, and I wanted to git so fur
  away they wouldn't ketch up. And we got into bad country, where there wasn't
  no water skurcely. We swung too fur north, and got into the desert back
  there. And over next them three buttes little Minervy took sick. We tried to
  git outa the desert&mdash;we headed over this way. But before we got to Snake
  river she&mdash;died, and I had to leave 'er buried back there. We come on. I
  hated the church worse than ever, and I wanted to git clear away from 'em.
  Why, Billy Louise, we camped one night by the Wolverine, right about where
  your paw's got his big corral! We didn't stay there, because it was an Injun
  camping-ground then, and they wasn't no use getting mixed up in no fuss,
  first thing. In them days the Injuns wasn't so peaceable as they be now. So
  we come on here and settled in the Cove.</p>

  <p>"And so&mdash;I like yuh," said Marthy, in a tone that was half defiance,
  "because I can't help likin' yuh. You're growin' up sweet and purty, jest
  like I wanted my little Minervy to grow up. In some ways you remind me of
  her, only she was quieter and didn't take so much notice of things a young
  one ain't s'posed to notice. Now I don't want you askin' no more questions
  about her, 'cause I ain't going to talk about it ag'in; and if yuh pester me,
  I'll send yuh home and tell your maw to keep yuh there. If you're the nice
  girl I think yuh be, you'll be good to Marthy and not talk about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Billy Louise opened her eyes still wider, and licked the honey off one
  whole corner of the slice without really tasting anything. Marthy's square,
  uncompromising chin was actually quivering. Billy Louise was stricken dumb by
  the spectacle. She wanted to go and put her arms around Marthy's neck and
  kiss her; only Marthy's neck had a hairy mole, and there was no part of her
  face which looked in the least degree kissable. Still, Billy Louise felt
  herself all hot inside with remorse and sympathy and affection. Physical
  contact being impossible because of her fastidious instincts, and speech upon
  the subject being so sternly forbidden, Billy Louise continued to lick honey
  and stare in fascinated silence.</p>

  <p>"I'll wash the dishes for you, Marthy," she offered irrelevantly at last,
  as a supreme sacrifice upon the altar of sympathy. When that failed to stop
  the slow procession of tears that was traveling down the furrows of Marthy's
  cheeks, she added ingratiatingly: "I'll put six raisings on the cookie I'm
  going to make for you."</p>

  <p>Whereupon Marthy did an unprecedented, an utterly amazing thing. She got
  up and gathered Billy Louise into her arms so unexpectedly that Billy Louise
  inadvertently buried her nose in the honey she had not yet licked off the
  bread. Marthy held her close pressed to her big, flabby bosom and wept into
  her hair in a queer, whimpering way that somehow made Billy Louise think of a
  hurt dog. It was only for a minute that Marthy did this; she stopped almost
  as suddenly as she began and went outside, wiping her eyes and her nose
  impartially upon her dirty apron.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise sat paralyzed with the mixture of unusual emotions that
  assailed her. She was exceedingly sticky and uncomfortable from honey and
  tears, and she shivered with repugnance at the odor of Marthy's unbathed
  person. She was astonished at the outburst from phlegmatic Marthy Meilke, and
  her pity was now alloyed with her promise to wash all those dirty dishes.
  Billy Louise felt that she had been a trifle hasty in making promises. There
  was not a drop of water in the house nor a bit of wood, and Billy Louise knew
  perfectly well that the dishpan would have a greasy, unpleasant feeling under
  her fastidious little fingers.</p>

  <p>She sighed heavily. "Well, I s'pose I might just as well get to work at
  'em," she said aloud, as was her habit&mdash;being a child who had no
  playmates. "I hate to dread a thing I hate."</p>

  <p>She looked at the messy slice of sour bread and threw it out to the
  speckled hen that had returned and was standing with one foot lifted
  tentatively&mdash;ready for a forward step if the fates seemed kind&mdash;and
  was regarding Billy Louise fixedly with one yellow eye. "Take it and go!"
  cried the donor, impatient of the scrutiny. She picked up the wooden pail and
  went down to the creek behind the house, by a pathway bordered thickly with
  budding rosebushes and tall lilacs.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise first of all washed her face slowly and with a methodic
  thoroughness which characterized her&mdash;having lived for ten full years
  with no realization of hours and minutes as a measure for her actions. She
  dried her face quite as deliberately upon her starched calico apron. Then she
  spent a few minutes trying to catch a baby trout in her cupped palms. Never
  had Billy Louise succeeded in catching a baby trout in her hands; therefore
  she never tired of trying. Now, however, that rash promise nagged at her and
  would not let her enjoy the game as completely as usual. She took the wooden
  pail, and squatting on her heels in the wet sand, waited until a small school
  swam incautiously close to the bank, and scooped suddenly, with a great
  splash. She caught three tiny, speckled fish the length of her little finger,
  and she let the half-full pail rest in the shallow stream while she watched
  the fry swimming excitedly round and round within.</p>

  <p>There was no great fun in that. Billy Louise could catch baby trout in a
  pail at home, from the waters of the Wolverine, whenever she liked. Many a
  time she had kept them in a big bottle until she tired of watching them, or
  they died because she forgot to change the water often enough. She could not
  get even a languid enjoyment out of them now, because she could not for a
  minute forget that she had promised to wash Marthy's dishes&mdash;and Marthy
  always had so many dirty dishes! And Marthy's dishpan was so greasy! Billy
  Louise gave a little shudder when she thought of it.</p>

  <p>"I wish her little girl hadn't died," she said, her mind swinging from
  effect back to cause. "I could play with her. And she'd wash the dishes
  herself. I'm going to name my new little pig Minervy. I wish she hadn't died.
  I'd show her my little pig, if Marthy'd let her come over to our place. We
  could both ride on old Badger; Minervy could ride behind me, and we'd go
  places together." Billy Louise meditatively stirred up the baby trout with a
  forefinger. "We'd go up the canyon and have the caves for our play-houses.
  Minervy could have the secret cave away up the hill, and I'd have the other
  one across from it; and we'd have flags and wigwag messages like daddy tells
  about in the war. And we'd play the rabbits are Injuns, and the coyotes are
  big-Injun-chiefs sneaking down to see if the forts are watching. And
  whichever seen a coyote first would wigwag to the other one..." A baby trout,
  taking advantage of the pail tipping in the current, gave a flip over the
  edge and interrupted Billy Louise's fancies. She gave the pail a tilt and
  spilled out the other two fish. Then she filled it as full as she could carry
  and started back to pay the price of her sympathy.</p>

  <p>"I don't see what Minervy had to go and die for!" she complained, dodging
  a low-hanging branch of bloom-laden lilac. "She could wash the dishes and I'd
  wipe 'em&mdash;and I s'pose there ain't a clean dish-towel in the house,
  either! Marthy's an awful slack housekeeper."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise, being a young person with a conscience&mdash;of a
  sort&mdash;washed the dishes, since she had given her word to do it. The
  dishpan was even more unpleasant than experience had foretold for her; and of
  Marthy's somewhat meager supply there seemed not one clean dish in the house.
  The sympathy of Billy Louise therefore waned rapidly; rather, it turned in
  upon itself. So that by the time she felt morally free to spend the rest of
  the afternoon as she pleased, she was not at all sorry for Marthy for having
  lost Minervy; instead, she was sorry for herself for having been betrayed
  into rashness and for being deprived of a playmate.</p>

  <p>"I don't s'pose Marthy doctored her right, at all," she considered
  pitilessly, as she returned down the lilac-bordered path. "If she had, I
  guess she wouldn't have died. I'll bet she never gave her a speck of sage
  tea, like mommie always does when I'm sick&mdash;only I ain't ever, thank
  goodness. I'm just going to ask Jase if Marthy did."</p>

  <p>On the way to the root cellar, which was dug into the creek-bank well
  above high-water mark, Billy Louise debated within herself the ethics of
  speaking to Jase upon a forbidden subject. Jase had been Minervy's father,
  and therefore knew of her existence, so that mentioning Minervy to him could
  not in any sense be betraying a secret. She wondered if Jase felt badly about
  it, as Marthy seemed to do. On the heels of that came the determination to
  test his emotional capacity.</p>

  <p>At the root cellar her attention was diverted. The cellar door was
  fastened on the outside, with the iron hasp used to protect the store of
  vegetables from the weather. Jase must be gone. She was turning away when she
  heard him clear his throat with that peculiar little hacking, rasping noise
  which sounded exactly as one would expect a Jase to sound. Billy Louise
  puckered her eyebrows, pressed her lips together understandingly&mdash;and
  disapprovingly&mdash;and opened the door.</p>

  <p>Jase, humped over a heap of sprouting potatoes, blinked up apathetically
  into the sudden flood of sweet, spring air and sunshine. "Why, hello, Billy
  Louise," he mumbled, his eyes brightening a bit.</p>

  <p>"Say, you was locked in here!" Billy Louise faced him puzzled. "Did you
  know you was locked in?"</p>

  <p>"Yes-s, I knowed it. Marthy, she locked the door." Jase reached out a bony
  hand covered with carrot-colored hairs and picked up a shriveling potato with
  long, sickly sprouts proclaiming life's persistence in perpetuating itself
  under adverse circumstances. He broke off the sprouts with a wipe of his
  dirty palm and threw the potato into a heap in the corner.</p>

  <p>"What for?" Billy Louise demanded, watching Jase reach languidly out for
  another potato.</p>

  <p>"She seen me diggin' bait," Jase said tonelessly. "I did think some of
  ketchin' a mess of fish before I went to sproutin' p'tatoes, but Marthy she
  don't take no int'rest in nothin' but work."</p>

  <p>"Are the fish biting good?" Billy Louise glanced toward the wider stream,
  where it showed through a gap in the alders.</p>

  <p>"Yes-s, purty good now. I caught a nice mess the other day; but Marthy,
  she don't favor my goin' fishin'." The lean hands of Jase moved slowly at his
  task. Billy Louise, watching him, wondered why he did not hurry a little and
  finish sooner. Still, she could not remember ever seeing Jase hurry at
  anything, and the Cove with its occupants was one of her very earliest
  memories.</p>

  <p>"Say, I'll dig some more bait, and then we'll go fishing; shall we?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;dunno as I better&mdash;" Jase's hand hovered aimlessly over the
  potato pile. "I got quite a lot sprouted, though&mdash;and mebby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll lock you in till I get the bait dug," suggested Billy Louise
  craftily. "And you work fast; and then I'll let you out, and we'll lock the
  door agin, so Marthy'll think you're in there yet."</p>

  <p>"You're sure smart to think up things," Jase admired, smiling loose-lipped
  behind his scraggly beard, that was fading with the years. "I dunno but what
  it'd serve Marthy right. She ain't got no call to lock the door on me. She
  hates like sin t' see me with a fish-pole in m' hand&mdash;but she's always
  et her share uh the messes I ketch. She ain't a reasonable woman, Marthy
  ain't. You git the bait. I'll show Marthy who's boss in this Cove!"</p>

  <p>He might have encouraged himself into defying Marthy to her face, in
  another five minutes of complaining. But the cellar door closed upon him with
  a slam. Billy Louise was not interested in his opinion of Marthy; with her,
  opinions were valueless if not accompanied by action.</p>

  <p>"I never thought to ask him about Minervy," occurred to her while she was
  relentlessly dragging pale, fleshly fishworms from the loose black soil of
  Marthy's onion bed. "But I know she was mean to Minervy. She's awful mean to
  Jase&mdash;locking him up in the root cellar just 'cause he wanted to go
  fishing. If I was Jase I wouldn't sprout a single old potato for her. My
  goodness, but she'll be mad when she opens the cellar door and Jase ain't in
  there; I&mdash;guess I'll go home early, before Marthy finds it out."</p>

  <p>She really meant to do that, but the fish were hungry fish that day, and
  the joy of having a companion to exclaim with her over every hard
  tug&mdash;even though that companion was only Jase&mdash;enticed her to stay
  on and on, until a whiff of frying pork on the breeze that swept down the
  Cove warned Billy Louise of the near approach of supper-time.</p>

  <p>"I guess mebby I might as well go back to the suller," Jase remarked, his
  defiance weakening as he climbed the bank. "You come and lock the door agin,
  Billy Louise, and Marthy won't know I ain't been there all the time. She'll
  think you caught the fish." He looked at her with a weak leer of conscious
  cunning.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise, groping vaguely for the sunbonnet that was dangling between
  her straight shoulder-blades, stared at him with wide eyes that held
  disillusionment and with it a contempt all the keener because it was the
  contempt of a child, whose judgment is merciless.</p>

  <p>"I should thing you'd be ashamed!" she said at last, forgetting that the
  idea had been born in her own brain. "Cowards do things and then sneak about
  it. Daddy says so. I don't care if Marthy is mad 'cause I let you out, and I
  don't care if she knows we went fishing. I thought you wanted Marthy to see
  she ain't so smart, locking you up in the cellar. I ain't going to bake you a
  single cookie with raisings on it, like I was going to."</p>

  <p>"Marthy's got a sharp tongue in 'er head," Jase wavered, his eyes shifting
  from Billy Louise's uncompromising stare.</p>

  <p>"Daddy says when you do a thing that's mean, do it and take your
  medicine," Billy Louise retorted. "The boy of me that belongs to dad ain't a
  sneak, Jase Meilke. And," she added loftily, "the girl of me that belongs to
  mommie is a perfeck lady. Good day, Mr. Meilke. Thank you for a pleasant time
  fishing."</p>

  <p>Whereupon the perfect lady part switched short skirts up the path and held
  a tousled head high with disdain.</p>

  <p>Jase, thus deserted, went shambling back to the cellar and fell to
  sprouting potatoes with what might almost be termed industry.</p>

  <p>It pained Jase later to discover that Marthy was not interested in the
  open door, but in the very small heap of potatoes which he had "sprouted"
  that afternoon. There was other work to be done in the Cove, and there were
  but two pairs of hands to do it; that one pair was slow and shiftless and
  inefficient was bitterly accepted by Marthy, who worked from sunrise until
  dark to make up for the shirking of those other hands.</p>

  <p>It was the trail experience over again, and it was an experience that
  dragged through the years without change or betterment. Marthy wanted to "get
  ahead." Jase wanted to sit in the sun with his knees drawn up, just&mdash;I
  don't know what, but I suppose he called it thinking. When he felt unusually
  energetic, he liked to dangle an impaled worm over a trout pool.
  Theoretically he also wanted to get ahead and to have a fine ranch and lots
  of cattle and a comfortable home. He would plan these things sometimes in an
  expansive mood, whereupon Marthy would stare at him with her hard,
  contemptuous look until Jase trailed off into mumbling complaints into his
  beard. He was not as able-bodied as she thought he was, he would say, with
  vague solemnity. Some uh these days Marthy'd see how she had driven him
  beyond his strength.</p>

  <p>When one is a Marthy, however, with ambitions and a tireless energy and
  the persistence of a beaver, and when one listens to vague mutterings for
  many hard laboring years, one grows accustomed to the complainings and fails
  to see certain warning symptoms of which even the complainer is only vaguely
  aware.</p>

  <p>She kept on working through the years, and as far as was humanly possible
  she kept Jase working. She did not soften, except toward Billy Louise, who
  rode sometimes over from her father's ranch on the Wolverine to the flowery
  delights of the Cove. The place was a perfect jungle of sweetness, seven
  months of each year; for Marthy owned and indulged a love of beauty, even if
  she could not realize her dream of prosperity. Wherever was space in the
  house-yard for a flower or a fruit tree or a berry bush, Marthy planted one
  or the other. You could not see the cabin from April until the leaves fell in
  late October, except in a fragmentary way as you walked around it. You went
  in at a gate of pickets which Marthy herself had split and nailed in place;
  you followed a narrow, winding path through the sweet jungle&mdash;and if you
  were tall, you stooped now and then to pass under an apple branch. And unless
  you looked up at the black, lava-rock rim of the bluff which cupped this Eden
  incongruously, you would forget that just over the brim lay parched plain and
  barren mountain.</p>

  <p>When Billy Louise was twelve, she had other ambitions than the making of
  cookies with "raisings" on them. She wanted to do something big, though she
  was hazy as to the particular nature of that big something. She tried to talk
  it over with Marthy, but Marthy could not seem to think beyond the Cove,
  except that now and then Billy Louise would suspect that her mind did travel
  to the desert and Minervy's grave. Marthy's hair was growing streaked with
  yellowish gray, though it never grew less unkempt and dusty looking. Her eyes
  were harder, if anything, except when they rested on Billy Louise.</p>

  <p>When she was thirteen, Billy Louise rode over with a loaf of bread she had
  baked all by herself, and she put this problem to Marthy: "I've been thinking
  I'd go ahead and write poetry, Marthy&mdash;a whole book of it with pictures.
  But I do love to make bread&mdash;and people have to eat bread. Which would
  you be, Marthy; a poet, or a cook?"</p>

  <p>Marthy looked at her a minute, lent her attention briefly to the question,
  and gave what she considered good advice.</p>

  <p>"You learn how to cook, Billy Louise. Yuh don't want to go and get
  notions. Your maw ain't healthy, and your paw likes good grub. Po'try is all
  foolishness; there ain't any money in it."</p>

  <p>"Walter Scott paid his debts writing poetry," said Billy Louise
  argumentatively. She had just read all about Walter Scott in a magazine which
  a passing cowboy had given her; perhaps that had something to do with her new
  ambition.</p>

  <p>"Mebby he did and mebby he didn't. I'd like to see our debts paid off with
  po'try. It'd have to be worth a hull lot more 'n what I'd give for it."</p>

  <p>"Oh. Have you got debts too, Marthy?" Billy Louise at thirteen was still
  ready with sympathy. "Daddy's got lots and piles of 'em. He bought some
  cattle and now he talks to mommie all the time about debts. Mommie wants me
  to go to Boise to school, next winter, to Aunt Sarah's. And daddy says
  there's debts to pay. I didn't know you had any, Marthy."</p>

  <p>"Well, I have got. We bought some cattle, too&mdash;and they ain't done 's
  well 's they might. If I had a man that was any good on earth, I could put up
  more hay. But I can't git nothing outa Jase but whines. Your paw oughta send
  you to school, Billy Louise, even if he has got debts. I'd 'a'
  sent&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped there, but Billy Louise knew how she finished the sentence
  mentally. She would have sent Minervy to school.</p>

  <p>"Your paw ain't got any right to keep you outa school," Marthy went on
  aggressively. "Debts er no debts, he'd see 't you got schoolin'&mdash;if he
  was the right kinda man."</p>

  <p>"Daddy is the right kinda man. He ain't like Jase. He says he wishes he
  could, but he don't know where the money's coming from."</p>

  <p>"How much's it goin' to take?" asked Marthy heavily.</p>

  <p>"Oh, piles." Billy Louise spoke airily to hide her pride in the importance
  of the subject. "Fifty dollars, I guess. I've got to have some new clothes,
  mommie says. I'd like a blue dress."</p>

  <p>"And your paw can't raise fifty dollars?" Marthy's tone was plainly
  belligerent.</p>

  <p>"Got to pay interest," said Billy Louise importantly.</p>

  <p>Marthy said not another word about debts or the duties of parents. What
  she did was more to the point, however, for she hitched the mules to a rattly
  old buckboard next day and drove over to the MacDonald ranch on the
  Wolverine. She carried fifty dollars in her pocket&mdash;and that was
  practically all the money Marthy possessed, and had been saved for the debts
  that harassed her. She gave the money to Billy Louise's mother and said that
  it was a present for Billy Louise, and meant for "school money." She said
  that she hadn't any girl of her own to spend the money on, and that Billy
  Louise was a good girl and a smart girl, and she wanted to do a little
  something toward her schooling.</p>

  <p>A woman will sacrifice more pride than you would believe, if she sees a
  way toward helping her children to an education. Mrs. MacDonald took the
  money, and she promised secrecy&mdash;with a feeling of relief that Marthy
  wished it. She was astonished to find that Marthy had any feelings not
  directly connected with work or the shortcomings of Jase, but she never
  suspected that Marthy had made any sacrifice for Billy Louise.</p>

  <p>So Billy Louise went away to school and never knew whose money had made it
  possible to go, and Marthy worked harder and drove Jase more relentlessly to
  make up that fifty dollars. She never mentioned the matter to anyone. The
  next year it was the same; when, in August, she questioned Billy Louise
  clumsily upon the subject of finances, and learned that "daddy" still talked
  about debts and interest and didn't know where the money was coming from, she
  drove over again with money for the "schooling." And again she extracted a
  promise of silence.</p>

  <p>She did this for four years, and not a soul knew that it cost her anything
  in the way of extra work and extra harassment of mind. She bought more cattle
  and cut more hay and went deeper into debt; for as Billy Louise grew older
  and prettier and more accustomed to the ways of town, she needed more money,
  and the August gift grew proportionately larger. The mother was thankful
  beyond the point of questioning. An August without Marthy and Marthy's gift
  of money would have been a tragedy; and so selfish is mother-love sometimes
  that she would have accepted the gift even if she had known what it cost the
  giver.</p>

  <p>At eighteen, then, Billy Louise knew some things not taught by the wide
  plains and the wild hills around her. She was not spoiled by her little
  learning, which was a good thing. And when her father died tragically beneath
  an overturned load of poles from the mountain at the head of the canyon,
  Billy Louise came home. The Billy of her tried to take his place, and the
  Louise of her attempted to take care of her mother, who was unfitted both by
  nature and habit to take care of herself. Which was, after all, a rather big
  thing for anyone to attempt.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; A STORM AND A STRANGER</h2>

  <p class="first">JASE began to complain of having "all-gone" feelings during
  the winter after Billy Louise came home and took up the whole burden of the
  Wolverine ranch. He complained to Billy Louise, when she rode over one clear,
  sunny day in January; he said that he was getting old&mdash;which was
  perfectly true&mdash;and that he was not as able-bodied as he might be, and
  didn't expect to last much longer. Billy Louise spoke of it to Marthy, and
  Marthy snorted.</p>

  <p>"He's able-bodied enough at mealtimes, I notice," she retorted. "I've
  heard that tune ever since I knowed him; he can't fool me!"</p>

  <p>"Not about the all-goneness, have you?" Billy Louise was preparing to wipe
  the dishes for Marthy. "I know he always had 'cricks' in different parts of
  his anatomy, but I never heard about his feeling all-gone, before. That
  sounds mysterious, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"No; and he never had nothin' the matter with his anatomy, neither; his
  anatomy's just as sound as mine. Jase was born lazy, is all ails him."</p>

  <p>"But, Marthy, haven't you noticed he doesn't look as well as he used to?
  He has a sort of gray look, don't you think? And his eyes are so puffy
  underneath, lately."</p>

  <p>"No, I ain't noticed nothing wrong with him that ain't always been wrong."
  Marthy spoke grudgingly, as if she resented even the possibility of Jase's
  having a real ailment. "He's feelin' his years, mebby. But he ain't no call
  to; Jase ain't but three years older 'n I be, and I ain't but fifty-nine last
  birthday. And I've worked and slaved here in this Cove fer twenty-seven
  years, now; what it is I've made it. Jase ain't ever done a hand's turn that
  he wasn't obliged to do. I've chopped wood, and I've built corrals and dug
  ditches, and Jase has puttered around and whined that he wasn't able-bodied
  enough to do no heavy lifting. That there orchard out there I planted and
  packed water in buckets to it till I got the ditch through. Them corrals down
  next the river I built. I dug the post-holes, and Jase set the posts in and
  held 'em steady while I tamped the dirt! In winter I've hauled hay and fed
  the cattle; and Jase, he packed a bucket uh slop, mebby, to the pigs! If he
  ain't as able-bodied as I be, it's because he ain't done nothing to git
  strong on. He can't come around me now with that all-gone feeling uh his; I
  know Jase Meilke like a book."</p>

  <p>There was more that she said about Jase. Standing there, a squat, unkempt
  woman with a seamed, leathery face and hard eyes now quite faded to gray, she
  told Billy Louise a good deal of the bitterness of the years behind; years of
  hardship and of slavish toil and no love to lighten it. She spoke again of
  Minervy, and the name brought back to Billy Louise poignant memories of her
  own lonely childhood and of her "pretend" playmate.</p>

  <p>Half shyly, because she was still sometimes touched with the
  inarticulateness of youth, Billy Louise told Marthy a little of that
  playmate. "Why, do you know, every time I rode old Badger anywhere, after
  that day you told me about Minervy, I used to pretend that Minervy rode
  behind me. I used to talk to her by the hour and take her places. And up our
  canyon is a cave that I used to play was Minervy's cave. I had another one,
  and I used to go over and visit Minervy. And I had another pretend
  playmate&mdash;a boy&mdash;and we used to have adventures. It's a queer
  place; I just found that cave by accident. I don't believe there's another
  person in the country who knows it's there at all. Well, that's Minervy's
  cave to me yet. And, Marthy&mdash;" Billy Louise giggled a little and eyed
  the old woman with a sidelong look that would have set a young man's blood
  a-jump&mdash;"I hope you won't be mad; I was just a kid, and I didn't know
  any better. But just to show you how much I thought: I had a little pig, and
  I named it Minervy, after you told me about her. And mommie told me that was
  no name for it; it was&mdash;it wasn't a girl pig, mommie said. So I called
  it Man-ervy, as the next best thing." She gave Marthy another wasted glance
  from the corners of her eyes. "Oh, Marthy!" she cried remorsefully, setting
  down the gravy bowl that she might pat Marthy on her fat, age-rounded
  shoulder. "What a little beast I am! I shouldn't have told that; but honest,
  I thought it was an honor. I&mdash;I just worshiped that pig!"</p>

  <p>Jase maundered in at that moment, and Marthy, catching up a corner of her
  dirty apron&mdash;Billy Louise could not remember ever seeing Marthy in a
  perfectly clean dress or apron&mdash;wiped away what traces of emotion her
  weathered face could reveal. Also, she turned and glared at Jase with what
  Billy Louise considered a perfectly uncalled-for animosity. In reality,
  Marthy was covertly looking for visible symptoms of the all-goneness. She
  shut her harsh lips together tightly at what she saw; Jase certainly was
  puffy under his watery, pink-rimmed eyes, and the withered cheeks above his
  thin graying beard really did have a pasty, gray look.</p>

  <p>"D' you turn them calves out into the corral?" she demanded, her voice
  harder because of her secret uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"I was goin' to, but the wind's changed into the north, 'n' I thought
  mebby you wouldn't want 'em out." Jase turned back aimlessly to the door. His
  voice was getting cracked and husky, and the deprecating note dominated
  pathetically all that he said. "You'll have to face the wind goin' home," he
  said to Billy Louise. "More 'n likely you'll be facin' snow, too. Looks bad,
  off that way."</p>

  <p>"You go on and turn them calves out!" Marthy commanded him harshly. "Billy
  Louise ain't goin' home if it storms; I sh'd think you'd know enough to know
  that."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but I'll have to go, anyway," the girl interrupted. "Mommie can't be
  there alone; she'd worry herself to death if I didn't show up by dark. She
  worries about every little thing since daddy died. I ought to have gone
  before&mdash;or I oughtn't to have come. But she was worrying about you,
  Marthy; she hadn't seen or heard of you for a month, and she was afraid you
  might be sick or something. Why don't you get someone to stay with you? I
  think you ought to."</p>

  <p>She looked toward the door, which Jase had closed upon his departure. "If
  Jase should&mdash;get sick, or anything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jase ain't goin' to git sick," Marthy retorted glumly. "Yuh don't want to
  let him worry yuh, Billy Louise. If I'd worried every time he yowled around
  about being sick, I'd be dead or crazy by now. I dunno but maybe I'll have
  somebody to help with the work, though," she added, after a pause during
  which she had swiped the dish-rag around the sides of the pan once or twice,
  and had opened the door and thrown the water out beyond the doorstep like the
  sloven she was. "I got a nephew that wants to come out. He's been in a bank,
  but he's quit and wants to git on to a ranch. I dunno but I'll have him come,
  in the spring."</p>

  <p>"Do," urged Billy Louise, perfectly unconscious of the potentialities of
  the future. "I hate to think of you two down here alone. I don't suppose
  anyone ever comes down here, except me&mdash;and that isn't often."</p>

  <p>"Nobody's got any call to come down," said Marthy stolidly. "They sure
  ain't going to come for our comp'ny and there ain't nothing else to bring
  'em."</p>

  <p>"Well, there aren't many to come, you know," laughed Billy Louise, shaking
  out the dish towel and spreading it over two nails, as she did at home. "I'm
  your nearest neighbor, and I've got six miles to ride&mdash;against the wind,
  at that. I think I'd better start. We've got a halfbreed doing chores for us,
  but he has to be looked after or he neglects things. I'll not get another
  chance to come very soon, I'm afraid; mommie hates to have me ride around
  much in the winter. You send for that nephew right away, why don't you,
  Marthy?" It was like Billy Louise to mix command and entreaty together.
  "Really, I don't think Jase looks a bit well."</p>

  <p>"A good strong steepin' of sage'll fix him all right, only he ain't sick,
  as I see. You take this shawl."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise refused the shawl and ran down the twisted path fringed with
  long, reaching fingers of the hare berry bushes. At the stable she stopped
  for an aimless dialogue with Jase and then rode away, past the orchard whose
  leafless branches gave glimpses of the low, sod-roofed cabin, with Marthy
  standing rather disconsolately on the rough doorstep watching her go.</p>

  <p>Absently she let down the bars in the narrowest place in the gorge and
  lifted them into their rude sockets after she had led her horse through. All
  through the years since Marthy had gone down that rocky gash in search of
  Buck and Bawley, no human being had entered or left the Cove save through
  that narrow opening. The tingle of romance which swept always the nerves of
  the girl when she rode that way fastened upon her now. She wished the Cove
  belonged to her; she thought she would like to live in a place like that,
  with warlike Indians all around and that gorge to guard day and night. She
  wished she had been Marthy, discovering that place and taming it, little by
  little, in solitary achievement the sweeter because it had been hard.</p>

  <p>"It's a bigger thing," said Billy Louise aloud to her horse, "to make a
  home here in this wilderness, than to write the greatest poem in the world or
  paint the greatest picture or&mdash;anything. I wish..."</p>

  <p>Blue was climbing steadily out of the gorge, twitching an ear backward
  with flattering attention when his lady spoke. He held it so for a minute,
  waiting for that sentence to be finished, perhaps; for he was wise beyond his
  kind&mdash;was Blue. But his lady was staring at the rock wall they were
  passing then, where the winds and the cold and heat had carved jutting ledges
  into the crude form of cabbages; though Billy Louise preferred to call them
  roses. Always they struck her with a new wonder, as if she saw them for the
  first time. Blue went on, calmly stepping over this rock and, around that as
  if it were the simplest thing in the world to find sure footing and carry his
  lady smoothly up that trail. He threw up his head so suddenly that Billy
  Louise was startled out of her aimless dreamings, and pointed nose and ears
  toward the little creek-bottom above, where Marthy had lighted her camp-fire
  long and long ago.</p>

  <p>A few steps farther, and Blue stopped short in the trail to look and
  listen. Billy Louise could see the nervous twitchings of his muscles under
  the skin of neck and shoulders, and she smiled to herself. Nothing could ever
  come upon her unaware when she rode alone, so long as she rode Blue. A
  hunting dog was not more keenly alive to his surroundings.</p>

  <p>"Go on, Blue," she commanded after a minute. "If it's a bear or anything
  like that, you can make a run for it; if it's a wolf, I'll shoot it. You
  needn't stand here all night, anyway."</p>

  <p>Blue went on, out from behind the willow growth that hid the open. He
  returned to his calm, picking a smooth trail through the scattered rocks and
  tiny washouts. It was the girl's turn to stare and speculate. She did not
  know this horseman who sat negligently in the saddle and looked up at the
  cedar-grown bluff beyond, while his horse stood knee-deep in the little
  stream. She did not know him; and there were not so many travelers in the
  land that strangers were a matter of indifference.</p>

  <p>Blue welcomed the horse with a democratic nicker and went forward briskly.
  And the rider turned his head, eyed the girl sharply as she came up, and
  nodded a cursory greeting. His horse lifted its head to look, decided that it
  wanted another swallow or two, and lowered its muzzle again to the water.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise could not form any opinion of the man's age or personality,
  for he was encased in a wolfskin coat which covered him completely from
  hatbrim to ankles. She got an impression of a thin, dark face, and a sharp
  glance from eyes that seemed dark also. There was a thin, high nose, and
  beyond that Billy Louise did not look. If she had, the mouth must certainly
  have reassured her somewhat.</p>

  <p>Blue stepped nonchalantly down into the stream beside the strange horse
  and went across without stopping to drink. The strange horse moved on also,
  as if that were the natural thing to do&mdash;which it was, since chance sent
  them traveling the same trail. Billy Louise set her teeth together with the
  queer little vicious click that had always been her habit when she felt
  thwarted and constrained to yield to circumstances, and straightened herself
  in the saddle.</p>

  <p>"Looks like a storm," the fur-coated one observed, with a perfectly
  transparent attempt to lighten the awkwardness.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise tilted her chin upward and gazed at the gray sweep of clouds
  moving sullenly toward the mountains at her back. She glanced at the man and
  caught him looking intently at her face.</p>

  <p>He did not look away immediately, as he should have done, and Billy Louise
  felt a little heat-wave of embarrassment, emphasized by resentment.</p>

  <p>"Are you going far?" he queried in the same tone he had employed
  before.</p>

  <p>"Six miles," she answered shortly, though she tried to be decently
  civil.</p>

  <p>"I've about eighteen," he said. "Looks like we'll both get caught out in a
  blizzard."</p>

  <p>Certainly, he had a pleasant enough voice&mdash;and after all it was not
  his fault that he happened to be at the crossing when she rode out of the
  gorge. Billy Louise, in common justice, laid aside her resentment and looked
  at him with a hint of a smile at the corners of her lips.</p>

  <p>"That's what we have to expect when we travel in this country in the
  winter," she replied. "Eighteen miles will take you long after dark."</p>

  <p>"Well, I was sort of figuring on putting up at some ranch, if it got too
  bad. There's a ranch somewhere ahead, on the Wolverine, isn't there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Billy Louise bit her lip; but hospitality is an unwritten law of
  the West&mdash;a law not to be lightly broken. "That's where I live. We'll be
  glad to have you stop there, of course."</p>

  <p>The stranger must have felt and admired the unconscious dignity of her
  tone and words, for he thanked her simply and refrained from looking too
  intently at her face.</p>

  <p>Fine siftings of snow, like meal flung down from a gigantic sieve, swept
  into their faces as they rode on. The man turned his face toward her after a
  long silence. She was riding with bowed head and face half turned from him
  and the wind alike.</p>

  <p>"You'd better ride on ahead and get in out of this," he said curtly. "Your
  horse is fresh. It's going to be worse and more of it, before long; this
  cayuse of mine has had thirty miles or so of rough going."</p>

  <p>"I think I'd better wait for you," she said primly. "There are bad places
  where the trail goes close to the bluff, and the lava rock will be slippery
  with this snow. And it's getting dark so fast that a stranger might go
  over."</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, the sooner you are past the bad places the better.
  I'm all right. You drift along."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise speculated briefly upon the note of calm authority in his
  voice. He did not know, evidently, that she was more accustomed to giving
  commands than to obeying them; her lips gave a little quirk of amusement at
  his mistake.</p>

  <p>"You go on. I don't want a guide." He tilted his head peremptorily toward
  the blurred trail ahead.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise laughed a little. She did not feel in the least embarrassed
  now. "Do you never get what you don't want?" she asked him mildly. "I'd a lot
  rather lead you past those places than have you go over the edge," she said,
  "because nobody could get you up, or even go down and bury you decently. It
  wouldn't be a bit nice. It's much simpler to keep you on top."</p>

  <p>He said something, but Billy Louise could not hear what it was; she
  suspected him of swearing. She rode on in silence.</p>

  <p>"Blue's a dandy horse on bad trails and in the dark," she observed
  companionably at last. "He simply can't lose his footing or his way."</p>

  <p>"Yes? That's nice."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise felt like putting out her tongue at him, for the cool
  remoteness of his tone. It would serve him right to ride on and let him break
  his neck over the bluff if he wanted to. She shut her teeth together and
  turned her face away from him.</p>

  <p>So, in silence and with no very good feeling between them, they went
  precariously down the steep hill (the hill up which Marthy and the oxen and
  Jase had toiled so laboriously, twenty-seven years before) and across the
  tiny flat to where the cabin window winked a welcome at them through the
  storm.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; A BOOK, A BANNOCK, AND A BED</h2>

  <p class="first">BLUE led the way straight to the low, dirt-roofed stable of
  logs and stopped with his nose against the closed door. Billy Louise herself
  was deceived by the whirl of snow and would have missed the stable entirely
  if the leadership had been hers. She patted Blue gratefully on the shoulder
  when she unsaddled him. She groped with her fingers for the wooden peg in the
  wall where the saddle should hang, failed to find it, and so laid the saddle
  down against the logs and covered it with the blanket.</p>

  <p>"Just turn your horse in loose," she directed the man shortly. "Blue won't
  fight, and I think the rest of the horses are in the other part. And come on
  to the house."</p>

  <p>It pleased her a little to see that he obeyed her without protest; but she
  was not so pleased at his silence, and she led the way rather indignantly
  toward the winking eye which was the cabin's window.</p>

  <p>At the sound of their feet on the wide doorstep, her mother pulled open
  the door and stood fair in the light, looking out with the anxious look which
  had lived so long in her face that it had lines of its own chiseled deep in
  her forehead and at the sides of her mouth.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Billy Louise? Oh, ain't Peter Howling Dog with you? What
  makes you so terrible late, Billy Louise? Come right in, stranger. I don't
  know your name, but I don't need to know it. A storm like this is all the
  interduction a fellow needs, I guess." She smiled, at that. She had a nice
  smile, with a little resemblance to Billy Louise, except that the worried,
  inquiring look never left her eyes; as if she had once waited long for bad
  news, and had met everyone with anxious, eager questioning, and her eyes had
  never changed afterwards. Billy Louise glanced at her with her calm,
  measuring look, making the contrast very sharp between the two.</p>

  <p>"What about Peter?" she asked. "Isn't he here?"</p>

  <p>"No, and he ain't been since an hour or so after you left. He saddled up
  and rode off down the river&mdash;to the reservation, I reckon."</p>

  <p>"Then the chores aren't done, I suppose." Billy Louise went over and took
  a lantern down from its nail, turning up the wick so that she could light it
  with the candle. "Go up to the fire and thaw out," she invited the man.
  "We'll have supper in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>Instead he reached out and took the lantern from her as soon as she had
  lighted it. "You go to the fire yourself," he said. "I'll do what's necessary
  outside."</p>

  <p>"Why-y&mdash;" Billy Louise, her fingers still clinging to the lantern,
  looked up at him. He was staring down at her with that intent look she had
  objected to on the trail, but she saw his mouth, and the little smile that
  hid just back of his lips. She smiled back without knowing it. "I'll have to
  go along, anyway. There are cows to milk and you couldn't very well find the
  cow-stable alone."</p>

  <p>"Think not?"</p>

  <p>Billy Louise had been perfectly furious at that tone, out on the trail.
  Now that she could see his lips and their little twitching to keep back the
  smile, she did not mind the tone at all. She had turned away to get the milk
  pails, and now she gave him a sidelong look, of the kind that had been
  utterly wasted upon Marthy. The man met it and immediately turned his
  attention to the lantern wick, which needed nice adjustment before its blaze
  quite pleased him; he was not a Marthy to receive such a look unmoved.</p>

  <p>Together they went out again into the storm they had left so eagerly.
  Billy Louise showed him where was the pitchfork and the hay, and then did the
  milking while he piled full the mangers. After that they went together and
  turned the shivering work horses into the stable from the corral where they
  huddled, rumps to the storm; and the man lifted great forkfuls of hay and
  carried it into their stalls, while Billy Louise held the lantern high over
  her head like a western Liberty. They did not talk much, except when there
  was need for speech; but they were beginning to feel a little glow of
  companionship by the time they were ready to fight their way against the
  blizzard to the house, Billy Louise going before with the lantern, while the
  man followed close behind, carrying the two pails of milk that was already
  freezing in little crystals to the tin.</p>

  <p>"Did you get everything done? You must be half froze&mdash;and starved
  into the bargin." Mrs. MacDonald, as is the way of some women who know the
  weight of isolation, had a habit of talking with a nervous haste at times,
  and of relapsing into long, brooding silences afterwards. She talked now,
  while she pulled a pan of hot, brown biscuits from the oven, poured the tea,
  and turned crisp, browned potatoes out of a frying-pan into a deep, white
  bowl. She wondered, over and over, why Peter Howling Dog had left and why he
  did not return. She said that was the way, when you depended on Indians for
  anything. She did wish there was a white man to be had. She asked after
  Marthy and Jase and gave Billy Louise no opportunity to tell her
  anything.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise glanced often at the man, who did not look in the least as
  she had fancied, except that he really did have a high nose and terribly keen
  eyes with something behind the keenness that baffled her. And his mouth was
  pleasant, especially when that smile hid just behind his lips; also, she
  liked his hair, which was thick and brown, with hints of red in it here and
  there, and a strong inclination to curl where it was longest. She had known
  he was tall when he stepped into the light of the door; now she saw that he
  was slim to the point of leanness, with square shoulders and a nervous
  quickness when he moved. His fingers were never idle; when he was not eating,
  he rolled bits of biscuit into tiny, soggy balls beside his plate, or played
  a soft tattoo with his fork.</p>

  <p>"I didn't quite catch your name, mister," her mother said finally. "But
  take another biscuit, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Warren is my name," returned the man, with that hidden smile because she
  had never before given him any opportunity to tell it. "Ward Warren. I've got
  a claim over on Mill Creek."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise gave a little gasp and distractedly poured two spoons of
  sugar in her tea, although she hated it sweetened.</p>

  <p>I've got to tell you why, even at the price of digression. Long ago, when
  Billy Louise was twelve or so, and lived largely in a dream world of her own
  with Minervy for her "pretend" playmate, she had one day chanced upon a
  paragraph in a paper that had come from town wrapped around a package of
  matches. It was all about Ward Warren. The name caught her fancy, and the
  text of the paragraph seized upon her imagination. Until school filled her
  mind with other things, she had built adventures without end in which Ward
  Warren was the central figure. Up the canyon at the caves, she sometimes
  pretended that Ward Warren had abducted Minervy and that she must lead the
  rescue. Sometimes, when she rode in the hills, Ward Warren abducted her and
  led her into strange places where she tried to shiver in honest dread. Often
  and often, however, Ward Warren was a fugitive who came to her for help; then
  she would take him to Minervy's cave and hide him, perhaps; or she would
  mount her horse and lead him, by devious ways, to safety, and upon some
  hilltop from which she could point out the route he must follow, she would
  bid him a touching adieu and beseech him, in the impossible language of some
  old romancer, to go and lead a blameless life. Sitting there at the table
  opposite him, stirring the sugar heedlessly into her tea, one favorite
  exhortation returned from her dream-world, clear as if she had just spoken it
  aloud. "Go, and sin no more; and if perchance you will in some distant far
  land send me a kind thought, that will be reward enough for what I have done
  this day. Farewell, Ward Warren&mdash;Kismet."</p>

  <p>The lips of Billy Louise smiled and stopped just short of laughter, and
  she looked across at Ward Warren as if she expected him to laugh also at that
  frightfully virtuous though stilted adieu. She found him looking straight at
  her in that intent fashion that seemed as if he would see through and all
  around her and her thoughts. He was not smiling at all. His mouth was pulled
  into a certain bitter understanding; indeed, he looked exactly as if Billy
  Louise had dealt him a deliberate affront which he could neither parry nor
  fling back at her, but must endure with what stoicism he might.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise blushed guiltily, took an unpremeditated swallow of tea, and
  grimaced over the sickish sweetness of it. She got up and emptied the tea
  into the slop bucket, and loitered over the refilling of the cup so that when
  she returned to the table she was at least outwardly calm. She felt another
  quick, keen glance from across the table, but she helped herself composedly
  to the cream and listened to her mother with flattering attention.</p>

  <p>"Jase has got all-gone feelings now, mommie," she remarked irrelevantly
  during a brief pause and relapsed into silence again. She knew that was good
  for at least five minutes of straight monologue, with her mother in that
  talking mood. She finished her supper while Warren listened abstractedly to a
  complete biography of the Meilkes and learned all about Marthy's energy and
  Jase's shiftlessness.</p>

  <p>"Ward Warren!" Billy Louise was saying to herself. "Did you ever in your
  life&mdash;it's exactly as if Minervy should come to life and walk in. Ward
  Warren! There couldn't possibly be two Ward Warrens; it's such an odd name.
  Well!"</p>

  <p>Then she went mentally over that paragraph. She wished she did not
  remember every single word of it, but she did. And she was afraid to look at
  him after that. And she wanted to, dreadfully. She felt as though he belonged
  to her. Why, he was her old playmate! And she had saved his life hundreds of
  times, at immense risks to herself; and he had always been her devoted slave
  afterwards, and never failed to appear at the precise moment when she was
  beset by Indians or robbers or something, and in dire need. The blood he had
  shed in her behalf! At that point Billy Louise startled herself and the
  others by suddenly laughing out loud at the memory of one time when Ward
  Warren had killed enough Indians to fill a deep washout so that he might
  carry her across to the other side! "Is there anything funny about Jase
  Meilke dying, Billy Louise?" her mother asked her in a perfectly shocked
  tone.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I was thinking of something else." She glanced at the man eyeing
  her so distrustfully from across the table and gurgled again. It was terribly
  silly, but she simply could not help seeing Ward Warren calmly filling that
  washout with dead Indians so that he might carry her across it in his arms.
  The more she tried to forget that, the funnier it became. She ended by
  leaving the table and retiring precipitately to her own tiny room in the
  lean-to where she buried her face as deep as it would go in a puffy pillow of
  wild duck feathers.</p>

  <p>He, poor devil, could not be expected to know just what had amused her so;
  he did know that it somehow concerned himself, however. He took up his
  position&mdash;mentally&mdash;behind the wall of aloofness which stood
  between himself and an unfriendly world, and when Billy Louise came out later
  to help with the dishes, he was sitting absorbed in a book.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise got out her algebra and a slate and began to ponder the
  problem of a much-handicapped goat's feeding-ground. Ward Warren read and
  read and read and never looked up from the pages. Never in her life had she
  seen a man read as he read; hungrily, as a starved man eats; rapidly, his
  eyes traveling like a shuttle across the page; down, down&mdash;flip a leaf
  quickly and let the shuttle-glance go on. Billy Louise let her slate, with
  the goat problem unsolved, lie in her lap while she watched him. When she
  finally became curious enough to decipher the name of the book&mdash;she had
  three or four in that dull, brown binding&mdash;and saw that he was reading
  <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, she felt stunned. She read Browning just as she
  drank sage tea; it was supposed to be good for her. Her English teacher had
  given her that book. She never would have believed that any living human
  could read it as Ward Warren was reading it now; avidly, absorbedly, lost to
  his surroundings&mdash;to her own presence, if you please! Billy Louise
  glanced at her mother. That lady, having discovered that her guest's gloves
  needed mending, was working over them with pieces of Indian-tanned buckskin
  and beeswaxed thread, the picture of domestic content.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise sighed. She shifted her chair. She got up and put a heavy
  chunk of wood on the fire and glanced over her shoulder at the man to see if
  he were going to take the hint and offer to help. She came back and stood
  close to him while she selected, with great deliberation, a book from the
  shelf beside his head. And Ward Warren, perfectly normal and not over
  twenty-five or so, pushed his chair out of her way with a purely mechanical
  movement, and read and read, and actually was too absorbed to feel her
  nearness. And he really was reading <i>The Ring and the Book</i>; Billy
  Louise was rude enough to look over his shoulder to make sure of that. She
  gave up, then, and though she picked a book at random from the shelf, she did
  not attempt to read it. She went to her room and made it ready for their
  guest, and after that she went to bed in her mother's room; and she thought
  and thought and did a lot of wondering about Life and about Ward Warren. She
  heard him go to bed, after a long while, and she wondered if he had finished
  the book first.</p>

  <p>The next morning the blizzard raged so that he stayed as a matter of
  course. Peter Howling Dog had not returned, so Warren did the chores and
  would not let Billy Louise help with anything. He filled the wood-box, piled
  great chunks of wood by the fireplace, and saw that the water-pails were full
  to the icy brims. He talked a little, and Billy Louise discovered that he was
  quick to see a joke, and that he simply could not be caught napping, but had
  always a retort ready for her. That was true until after dinner, when he
  picked up a book again. When that happened, he was dead to the world bounded
  by the coulee walls, and he did not show any symptoms of consciousness until
  he had reached the last page, just when the light was growing dim and
  blurring the lines so that he must hold the pages within six inches of his
  eyes. He closed the book with a long breath, placed it accurately upon the
  shelf where it had stood since Billy Louise came home from school, and picked
  up his hat and gloves. It was time to wade out through the snow and feed the
  stock and bring in more wood.</p>

  <p>"I wish we could get him to stay all winter, instead of that Peter Howling
  Dog," Mrs. MacDonald said anxiously, after he had gone out. "I just know
  Peter's off drinking. I don't think he's a safe man to have around, Billy
  Louise. I didn't when you hired him. I haven't felt easy a minute with him on
  the place. I wish you'd hire Mr. Warren, Billy Louise. He's nice and
  quiet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And he's got a ranch of his own. He doesn't strike me as a man who wants
  a job milking two cows and carrying slop to the pigs, mommie."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'd feel a lot easier if we had him instead of that breed; only we
  ain't even got the breed, half the time. This is the third time he's
  disappeared, in the two months we've had him. I really think you ought to
  speak to Mr. Warren, Billy Louise."</p>

  <p>"Speak to him yourself. You're the one that wants him," Billy Louise
  answered somewhat sharply. She adored her mother; but if she had to run the
  ranch, she did wish her mother would not interfere and give advice just at
  the wrong time.</p>

  <p>"Well, you needn't be cross about it; you know yourself that Peter can't
  be depended on a minute. There he went off yesterday and never fed the pigs
  their noon slop, and I had to carry it out myself. And my lumbago has
  bothered me ever since, just like it was going to give me another spell. You
  can't be here all the time, Billy Louise&mdash;leastways you ain't; and
  Peter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, good gracious, mommie! I told you to hire the man if you want him.
  Only Ward Warren isn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ward Warren pushed open the door and looked from one to the other, his
  eyes two question marks. "Isn't&mdash;what?" he asked and shut the door
  behind him with the air of one who is ready for anything.</p>

  <p>"Isn't the kind of man who wants to hire out to do chores," Billy Louise
  finished and looked at him straight. "Are you? Mommie wants to hire you."</p>

  <p>"Oh. Well, I was just about to ask for the job, anyway." He laughed, and
  the distrust left his eyes. "As a matter of fact, I was going over to Jim
  Larson's to hang out for the rest of the winter and get away from the
  lonesomeness of the hills. The old Turk's a pretty good friend of mine. But
  it looks to me as if you two needed something around that looks like a man a
  heap more than Jim does. I know Peter Howling Dog to a fare-you-well; you'll
  be all to the good if he forgets to come back. So if you'll stake me to a
  meal now and then, and a place to sleep, I'll be glad to see you through the
  winter&mdash;or until you get some white man to take my place." He took up
  the two water-pails and waited, glancing from one to the other with that
  repressed smile which Billy Louise was beginning to look for in his face.</p>

  <p>Now that matters had approached the point of decision, her mother stood
  looking at her helplessly, waiting for her to speak. Billy Louise drew
  herself up primly and ended by contradicting the action. She gave him the
  sidelong glance which he was least prepared to withstand&mdash;though in
  justice to Billy Louise, she was absolutely unconscious of its general
  effectiveness&mdash;and twisted her lips whimsically.</p>

  <p>"We'll stake you to a book, a bannock, and a bed if you want to stay, Mr.
  Warren," she said quite soberly. "Also to a pitchfork and an axe, if you
  like, and regular wages."</p>

  <p>His eyes went to her and steadied there with the intent expression in
  them. "Thanks. Cut out the wages, and I'll take the offer just as it stands,"
  he told her and pulled his hat farther down on his head. "She's going to be
  one stormy night, lay-dees," he added in quite another tone, on his way to
  the door. "Five o'clock by the town clock, and al-ll's well!" This last in
  still another tone, as he pushed out against the swooping wind and pulled the
  door shut with a slam. They heard him whistling a shrill, rollicking air on
  his way to the creek; at least, it sounded rollicking, the way he whistled
  it.</p>

  <p>"That's <i>The Old Chisholm Trail</i> he's whistling," Billy Louise
  observed under her breath, smiling reminiscently. "The very song I used to
  pretend he always sang when he came down the canyon to rescue Minervy and me!
  But of course&mdash;I knew all the time he's a cowboy; it said so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The whistling broke and he began to sing at the top of a clear,
  strong-lunged voice, that old, old trail song beloved of punchers the West
  over:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Oh, it's cloudy in the West and a-lookin' like rain,<br>
  And my damned old slicker's in the wagon again,<br>
  Coma ti yi youpy, youpy-a, youpy-a,<br>
  Coma ti yi youpy, youpy-a!"</p><br>

  <p>"What did you say, Billy Louise? I'm sure it's a comfort to have him here,
  and you see he was glad and willing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Billy Louise was holding the door open half an inch, listening and
  slipping back into the child-world wherein Ward Warren came singing down the
  canyon to rescue her and Minervy. The words came gustily from the creek down
  the slope:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"No chaps, no slicker, and a-pourin' down rain,<br>
  And I swear by the Lord I'll never night-herd again,<br>
  Coma ti yi youpy, youpy-a, youpy-a,<br>
  Coma ti yi youpy, youpy-a!</p>

  <p class="verse">"Feet in the stirrups and seat in the saddle,<br>
  I hung and rattled with them long-horn cattle,<br>
  Coma ti yi&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>"Do shut the door, Billy Louise! What you want to stand there like that
  for? And the wind freezing everything inside! I can feel a terrible draught
  on my feet and ankles, and you know what that leads to."</p>

  <p>So Billy Louise closed the door and laid another alder root on the coals
  in the fireplace, the while her mind was given over to dreamy speculations,
  and the words of that old trail song ran on in her memory though she could no
  longer hear him singing. Her mother talked on about Peter and the storm and
  this man who had ridden straight from the land of daydreams to her door, but
  the girl was not listening.</p>

  <p>"Now ain't you relieved, yourself, that he's going to stay?"</p>

  <p>Billy Louise, kneeling on the hearth and staring abstractedly into the
  fire, came back with a jerk to reality. The little smile that had been in her
  eyes and on her lips fled back with the dreams that had brought it. She gave
  her shoulders an impatient twitch and got up.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;I guess he'll be more agreeable to have around than Peter," she
  admitted taciturnly; which was as close to her real opinion of the man as a
  mere mother might hope to come.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; "OLD DAME FORTUNE'S USED ME FOR A
     FOOTBALL"</h2>

  <p class="first">WARD WARREN sat before the fireplace with a cigarette long
  gone cold in his fingers and stared into the blaze until the blaze died to
  bright-glowing coals, and the coals filmed and shrank down into the bed of
  ashes. Billy Louise had spoken to him twice, and he had not answered. She had
  swept all around him, and he had shifted his feet out of her way, and later
  his chair, like a man in his sleep who turns from an unaccustomed light or
  draws the covers over shoulders growing chilled, without any real
  consciousness of what he does. Billy Louise put away the broom, hung the
  dustpan on its nail behind the door, and stood looking at Ward curiously and
  with some resentment; this was not the first time he had gone into fits of
  abstraction as deep as his absorption in the books he read so hungrily. He
  had been at the Wolverine a month, and they were pretty well acquainted by
  now and inclined to friendliness when Ward threw off his moodiness and his
  air of holding himself ready for some affront which he seemed to expect. But
  for all that the distrust never quite left his eyes, and there were times
  like this when he was absolutely oblivious to her presence.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise suddenly lost patience. She stooped and picked up a bit of
  bark the size of her thumb and threw it at Ward, with a little, vexed twist
  of her lips. She had a fine accuracy of aim&mdash;she hit him on the nape of
  the neck, just where his hair came down in a queer little curly "cow-lick" in
  the middle.</p>

  <p>Ward jumped up and whirled, and when he faced Billy Louise he had a gun
  gripped in the fingers that had held the cigarette so loosely. In his eyes
  was the glare which a man turns upon his deadliest enemy, perhaps, but seldom
  indeed upon a girl. So they faced each other, while Billy Louise backed
  against the wall and took two sharp breaths.</p>

  <p>Ward relaxed; a shamed flush reddened his whole face. He shoved the gun
  back inside the belt of his trousers&mdash;Billy Louise had never dreamed
  that he carried any weapon save his haughty aloofness of manner&mdash;and
  with a little snort of self-disgust dropped back into the chair. He did not
  stare again into the fire, however; he folded his arms upon the high
  chairback and laid his face down upon them, like a woman who is hurt to the
  point of tears and yet will not weep. His booted feet were thrust toward the
  dying coals, his whole attitude spoke of utter desolation&mdash;of a
  loneliness beyond words.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise set her teeth hard together to keep back the tears of
  sympathy. Suffering of any sort always wrung the tender heart of her. But
  suffering like this&mdash;never in her life had she seen anything like it.
  She had seen her father angry, discouraged, morose. She had seen men fight.
  She had soothed her mother's grief, which expressed itself in tears and
  lamentations. But this hidden hurt, this stoical suffering that she had seen
  often and often in Ward's eyes and that sent his head down now upon his
  arms&mdash; She went to him and laid her two hands on his shoulders without
  even thinking that this was the first time she had ever touched him.</p>

  <p>"Don't!" she said, half whispering so that she would not waken her mother,
  in bed with an attack of lumbago. "I&mdash;I didn't know. Ward, listen to me!
  Whatever it is, can't you tell me? You&mdash;I'm your friend. Don't look as
  if you&mdash;you hadn't a friend on earth!"</p>

  <p>Still he did not move or give any sign that he heard. Billy Louise had no
  thought of coquetry. Her heart ached with pity and a longing to help him. She
  slid one hand up and pinched his ear, just as she would playfully tweak the
  ear of a child.</p>

  <p>"Ward, you mustn't. I've seen you think and think and look as if you
  hadn't a friend on earth. You mustn't. I suppose you've got lots of friends
  who'd stand by you through anything. Anyway, you've got me, and&mdash;I
  understand all about it." She whispered those last words, and her heart
  thumped heavily with trepidation after she had spoken.</p>

  <p>Ward raised his head, caught one of her hands and held it fast while he
  looked deep into her eyes. He was searching, questioning, measuring, and he
  was doing it without uttering a word. The plummet dropped straight into the
  clear, sweet depths of her soul. If it did not reach the bottom, he was
  satisfied with the soundings he took. He drew a deep breath and gave her hand
  a little squeeze and let it go.</p>

  <p>"Did I scare you? I'm sorry," he said, speaking in a hushed tone because
  of the woman in the next room. "I was thinking about a man I may meet some
  day; and if I do meet him, the chances are I'll kill him.
  I&mdash;didn't&mdash;I forgot where I was&mdash;" He threw out a hand in a
  gesture that amply completed explanation and apology and fumbled in his
  pocket for tobacco and papers. Abstractedly he began the making of a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise put wood on the fire, pulled up a square, calico-padded
  stool, and sat down. She waited, and she had the wisdom to wait in complete
  silence.</p>

  <p>Ward leaned forward with a twig in his hand, got it ablaze, and lighted
  his cigarette. He did not look at Billy Louise until he had taken a whiff or
  two. Then he stared at her for a full minute, and ended by flipping the
  charred twig playfully into her lap, and laughing a little because she
  jumped.</p>

  <p>"What made you catch your breath when I told my name that night I came?"
  he asked quizzically, but with a tensity behind the lightness of his tone and
  behind the little smile in his eyes as well. "Where had you ever heard of me
  before?"</p>

  <p>Billy Louise gasped again, sent a lightning-thought into the future, and
  answered more casually than she had hoped she could.</p>

  <p>"When I was a kid I ran across the name&mdash;somewhere&mdash;and I used
  it to play with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"You know&mdash;I was always making believe different things. I never had
  anyone to play with in my life, so I had a pretend-girl, named Minervy. And I
  had you. I used to have you rescue us from Indians and things, but mostly you
  were a road-agent or a robber, and when you weren't holding me or Minervy for
  ransom, I was generally leading you over some most ungodly trails, saving you
  from posses and things. I used," said Billy Louise, forcing a laugh, "to have
  some wild old times with you, believe me! So when you told your name,
  why&mdash;it was just like&mdash;you know; it was exactly like having a doll
  come to life!"</p>

  <p>He eyed her fixedly until she tingled with nervousness.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and what about&mdash;understanding all about it? Do you?" He
  drew in his under lip, let it go, and drew it again between his teeth, while
  he frowned at her thoughtfully. "Do you understand all about it?" he
  insisted, leaning toward her and never once taking that boring gaze from her
  face.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;well, I&mdash;do&mdash;some of it anyway." Billy Louise lifted a
  hand spasmodically to her throat. This was digging deeper into the agonies of
  life than she had ever gone before. "What was in the paper," she whispered
  later, as if his eyes were drawing it from her by force.</p>

  <p>"What was that? What did it say?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;what difference does it make, what it said?" Billy Louise
  turned imploring eyes upon him. Her breath was coming fast and uneven. "It
  doesn't matter&mdash;to me&mdash;in the least. It&mdash;didn't say much.
  I&mdash;can't tell exactly&mdash;" She was growing white around the mouth.
  The horror of being compelled to say, out loud&mdash;and to him! "I didn't
  know there was a woman in the world like you," Ward said irrelevantly and
  looked into the fire. "I thought women were just soft things a man had to
  take care of and carry along through life, a dead weight when they weren't
  worse. I never knew a woman could be a friend&mdash;the kind of friend a man
  can be." He threw his cigarette into the fire and watched the paper shrivel
  swiftly and the tobacco turn into a thin, blue smoke-spiral.</p>

  <p>"Life's a queer thing," he said, taking a different angle. "I started out
  with big notions about the things I'd do. Maybe I started wrong, but for a
  kid with nobody to point the trail for him, I don't think I did so
  worse&mdash;till old Dame Fortune spotted me in the crowd and proceeded to
  use me for a football." He leaned an elbow on one knee and stared hard at a
  burning brand that was getting ready to fall and send up a stream of sparks.
  Then he turned his head quite unexpectedly and looked at Billy Louise. "What
  was it you read?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;don't like to&mdash;say it," she whispered unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"Well, you needn't. I'll say it for you, when I come to it. There's a lot
  before that."</p>

  <p>Ward Warren had never before opened his soul to any human; not completely.
  Perhaps, sitting that evening in the deepening dusk, with the firelight
  lighting swiftly the brooding face of the girl and afterward veiling it
  softly with shadows, perhaps even then there were desolate places in his life
  which his words did not touch. But so much as a man may put into words, Ward
  told her; more, a great deal more, than he would ever tell to any other woman
  as long as he lived. More perhaps than he would ever tell to any man. And in
  it all there was no word of love. It was of what lay behind him that he
  talked. The low, even murmur of his voice was broken by long, brooding
  silences, when the two stared into the shifting flames and saw there the
  things his words had conjured. Sometimes the eyes of Billy Louise were soft
  with sympathy. Sometimes they were wide and held the light of horror. Once,
  with a small sob that had no tears, she reached out and clutched his arm.
  "Oh, don't!" she gasped. "Don't go on telling&mdash;I&mdash;I can't bear to
  listen to that!"</p>

  <p>"It isn't nice for a woman to listen to, I guess," Ward gritted. "I know
  it was hell to stand, but&mdash;" He was silent so long after that, and his
  eyes grew so intent and so somber while he stared, that Billy Louise pulled
  at his sleeve to recall him.</p>

  <p>"Skip that part and tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ward took up the story and told her much; more than she had ever dreamed
  could be. I can't repeat any of it; what he said was for Billy Louise to know
  and none other.</p>

  <p>It was late when she finally rose from the stool and lighted the lamp
  because her mother woke and called to her. Ward went out to turn the horses
  into the stable and fasten the door. He should have sheltered them two hours
  before. Billy Louise should long ago have made tea and toast for her mother,
  for that matter. But when life's big, bitter problems confront one, little
  things are usually forgotten.</p>

  <p>They came back to everyday realities, though the spell which Ward's
  impulsive unburdening had woven still wrapped them in that close
  companionship of complete understanding. They played checkers for an hour or
  so and then went to bed. Billy Louise lay in a waking nightmare because of
  all the hard things she had heard about life. Ward stared up into the dark
  and could not lose himself in sleep, because he had opened the door upon the
  evil places in his memory and let out all the trooping devils that lived
  there.</p>

  <p>After that, though there was never any word of love between them, Billy
  Louise, with the sure instinct of a woman innately pure, watched
  unobtrusively for signs of those fits of bitter brooding; watched and drove
  them off with various weapons of her own. Sometimes she cheerfully declared
  that she was bored to death, and wasn't Ward just dying for a game of "rob
  casino"? Sometimes she simply teased him into retaliation. Frequently she
  insisted that he repeat the things he had learned by heart, of poetry or
  humorous prose, for his memory was almost uncanny in its tenacity. She
  discovered quite early, and by accident, that she had only to shake her head
  in a certain way and declaim: "Ah, Tam, noo, Tam, thou'lt get thy
  faring&mdash;In hell they'll roast thee like a herring,"&mdash;she had only
  to say that to make him laugh and repeat the whole of <i>Tam O'Shanter's
  Ride</i> with a perfectly devilish zest for poor Tam's misfortunes, and an
  accent which made her suspect who were his ancestors.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise meant only to wean him from his bitterness against Life, and
  to convince him, by a somewhat roundabout method since at heart she was
  scared to death of his aloofness, that he was not "old lady Fortune's
  football" as he sometimes pessimistically declared. At thirteen she had mixed
  him with her dreams and led him by difficult trails to safety from the
  imaginary enemies that pursued him. At nineteen she unconsciously mixed him
  with her life and led him&mdash;more surely than in her dreams, and by a far
  more difficult trail, had she only known it&mdash;safe away from the devils
  of memory and a distrust of life that pursued him more relentlessly than any
  human foe.</p>

  <p>She only meant to wean him from pessimism and rebuild within him a healthy
  appetite for life. If she did more than that, she did not know it then; for
  Ward Warren had learned, along with other hard lessons, the art of keeping
  his thoughts locked safely away, and of using his face as a mask to hide even
  the doorway to his real self. Only his eyes turned traitors sometimes when he
  looked at Billy Louise; though she, being a somewhat self-centered young
  person, never quite read what they tried to betray.</p>

  <p>She took him up the canyon and showed him her cave and Minervy's. And she
  had the doubtful satisfaction of seeing him doubled over the saddle-horn in a
  paroxysm of laughter when she led him to the historical washout and recounted
  the feat of the dead Indians with which he had made a safe passing for
  her.</p>

  <p>"Well, they did it in history," she defended at last, her cheeks redder
  than was perfectly normal. "I read about it&mdash;at Waterloo when the Duke
  of Wellington&mdash;wasn't it? You needn't laugh as if it couldn't be done.
  It was that sunken-road business put it into my head in the first place; and
  I think you ought to feel flattered."</p>

  <p>"I do," gasped Ward, wiping his eyes. "Say, I was some bandit, wasn't I,
  William Louisa?"</p>

  <p>Billy Louise looked at him sidewise. "No, you weren't any bandit at
  all&mdash;then. You were a kind scout, that time. I was here, all surrounded
  by Indians and saying the Lord's prayer with my hair all down my back like
  mommie's Rock of Ages picture&mdash;will you shut up laughing?&mdash;and you
  came riding up that draw over there on a big, black horse named Sultan (You
  needn't snort; I still think Sultan's a dandy name for a horse!). And you
  hollered to me to get behind that rock, over there. And I quit at 'Forgive us
  our debts'&mdash;daddy always had so many!&mdash;and hiked for the rock. And
  you commenced shooting&mdash; Oh, I'm not going to tell you a single other
  pretend!" She sulked then, which was quite as diverting as the most
  hair-raising "pretend" she had ever told him and held Ward's attention
  unflaggingly until they were half way home.</p>

  <p>"Sing the <i>Chisholm Trail</i>," she commanded, when her temper was
  sunshiny again. This had been a particularly moody day for Ward, and Billy
  Louise felt that extra effort was required to rout the memory-devils. "Daddy
  knew a little of it, and old Jake Summers used to sing more, but I never did
  hear it all."</p>

  <p>"Ladies don't, as a general thing," Ward replied, biting his lips.</p>

  <p>"Why? I know there's about forty verses, and some of them are kind of
  sweary ones; but go ahead and sing it. I don't mind damn now and then."</p>

  <p>This sublime innocence was also diverting, even to a man haunted by the
  devils of memory. Ward's lips twitched, and a flush warmed his cheek-bones at
  the mere thought of singing it all in her presence. "I'll sing all of <i>Sam
  Bass</i>, if you like," he temporized, with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I hate <i>Sam Bass</i>! We had a Dutchman working for us when I was
  just a kid, and he was forever bawling out: 'Sa-am Pass was porn in Injiany,
  it was-s hiss natiff ho-o-ome!'"</p>

  <p>Billy Louise was a pretty good mimic. She had Ward doubled over the horn
  again and shouting so that the canyon walls roared echoes for three full
  minutes. "I've always wanted to hear the <i>Chisholm Trail</i>. I know how it
  was sung from Mexico north on the old cattle-trails, and how every ambitious
  puncher who had enough imagination and could make a rhyme, added a verse or
  so, till it's really a&mdash;a classic of the cow-camps."</p>

  <p>"Ye-es&mdash;it sure is all that." Ward eyed her furtively.</p>

  <p>"And with that memory of yours, I simply know that you can sing every
  single word of it," Billy Louise went on pitilessly&mdash;and innocently.
  "You're a cowpuncher yourself, and you must have heard it all, at one time
  and another; and I don't believe you ever forgot a thing in your life." She
  caught her breath there, conscience-stricken, and added hastily and
  imperiously, "So go on&mdash;begin at the beginning and sing it all. I'll
  keep tab and see if you sing forty verses." And she prompted
  coaxingly:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Come along, boys, and listen to my tale,<br>
  I'll tell you of my troubles on the old Chisholm trail,<br>
  Coma ti yi&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p class="first">and nodded her head approvingly when Ward took up the ditty
  where she left off and sang it with the rollicking enthusiasm which only a
  man who has soothed restless cattle on a stormy night can put into the
  doggerel.</p>

  <p>He did not sing the whole forty verses, for good and sufficient reasons
  best known to punchers themselves. But, with swift, shamed skipping of
  certain lines and some hasty revisions, he actually did sing thirty, and
  Billy Louise was so engrossed that she forgot to count them and never
  suspected the omissions; for some of the verses were quite "sweary" enough to
  account for his hesitation.</p>

  <p>The singing of those thirty verses brought a reminiscent mood upon the
  singer. For the rest of the way, which they rode at a walk, Ward sat very
  much upon one side of the saddle, with his body facing Billy Louise and his
  foot dangling free of the stirrup, and told her tales of trail-herds, and the
  cow-camps, and of funny things that had happened on the range. His "I
  remember one time" opened the door to a more fascinating world than Billy
  Louise's dream-world, because this other world was real.</p>

  <p>So, from pure accident, she hit upon the most effective of all weapons
  with which to fight the memory-devils. She led Ward to remembering the
  pleasanter parts of his past life and to telling her of them.</p>

  <p>When spring came at last, and he rode regretfully back to his claim on
  Mill Greek, he was not at all the morose Ward Warren who had ridden down to
  the Wolverine that stormy night in January. The distrust had left his eyes,
  and that guarded remoteness was gone from his manner. He thought and he
  planned as other men thought and planned, and looked into the future eagerly,
  and dreamed dreams of his own; dreams that brought the hidden smile often to
  his lips and his eyes.</p>

  <p>Still, the thing those dreams were built upon was yet locked tight in his
  heart, and not even Billy Louise, whose instinct was so keen and so sure in
  all things else, knew anything of them or of the bright-hued hope they were
  built upon. Fortune's football was making ready to fight desperately to
  become captain of the game, that he might be something more to Billy
  Louise.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; MARTHY BURIES HER DEAD AND GREETS HER
     NEPHEW</h2>

  <p class="first">JASE did not move or give his customary, querulous grunt
  when Marthy nudged him at daylight, one morning in mid-April. Marthy gave
  another poke with her elbow and lay still, numbed by a sudden dread. She
  moved cautiously out of the bed and half across the cramped room before she
  turned her head toward him. Then she stood still and looked and looked, her
  hard face growing each moment more pinched and stony and gray.</p>

  <p>Jase had died while the coyotes were yapping their dawn-song up on the rim
  of the Cove. He lay rigid under the coarse, gray blanket, the flesh of his
  face drawn close to the bones, his skimpy, gray beard tilted upward.</p>

  <p>Marthy's jaw set into a harsher outline than ever. She dressed with slow,
  heavy movements and went out and fed the stock. In stolid calm she did the
  milking and turned out the cows into the pasture. She gathered an apron full
  of chips and started a fire, just as she had done every morning for
  twenty-nine years, and she put the coffee-pot on the greasy stove and boiled
  the brew of yesterday&mdash;which was also her habit.</p>

  <p>She sat for some time with her head leaning upon her grimy hand and stared
  unseeingly out upon a peach-tree in full bloom, and at a pair of busy robins
  who had chosen a convenient crotch for their nest. Finally she rose stiffly,
  as if she had grown older within the last hour, and went outside to the place
  where she had been mending the irrigating ditch the day before; she knocked
  the wet sand off the shovel she had left sticking in the soft bank and went
  out of the yard and up the slope toward the rock wall.</p>

  <p>On a tiny, level place above the main ditch and just under the wall,
  Marthy began to dig, setting her broad, flat foot uncompromisingly upon the
  shoulder of the shovel and sending it deep into the yellow soil. She worked
  slowly and methodically and steadily, just as she did everything else. When
  she had dug down as deep as she could and still manage to climb out, and had
  the hole wide enough and long enough, she got awkwardly to the grassy surface
  and sat for a long while upon a rock, staring dumbly at the gaunt, brown
  hills across the river.</p>

  <p>She returned to the cabin at last, and with the manner of one who dreads
  doing what must be done, she went in where Jase lay stiff and cold under the
  blankets.</p>

  <p>Early that afternoon, Marthy went staggering up the slope, wheeling Jase's
  body before her on the creaky, home-made wheelbarrow. In the same harsh,
  primitive manner in which they both had lived, Marthy buried her dead. And
  though in life she had given him few words save in command or upbraiding,
  with never a hint of love to sweeten the days for either, yet she went
  whimpering away from that grave. She broke off three branches of precious
  peach blossoms and carried them up the slope. She stuck them upright in the
  lumpy soil over Jase's head and stood there a long while with tear-streaked
  face, staring down at the grave and at the nodding pink blossoms.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise rode singing down the rocky trail through the deep, narrow
  gorge, to where the hawthorn and choke-cherries hid the opening to the cove.
  Just on the edge of the thickest fringe, she pulled up and broke off tender
  branches of cherry bloom, then went on, still singing softly to herself
  because the air was sweet with spring odors, the sunshine lay a fresh yellow
  upon the land, and because the joy of life was in her blood and, like the
  birds, she had no other means of expression at hand. Blue's feet sank to the
  fetlocks in the rich, black soil of the little meadow that lay smooth to the
  tumbling sweep of the river behind its own little willow fringe. His ears
  perked forward, his eyes rolling watchfully for strange sights and sounds, he
  stepped softly forward, ready to wheel at the slightest alarm and gallop back
  up the gorge to more familiar ground. It was long since Billy Louise had
  turned his head down the rocky trail, and Blue liked little the gloom of the
  gorge and the sudden change to soft, black soil that stopped just short of
  being boggy in the wet places. Where the trail led into a marshy crossing of
  the big, irrigating ditch that brought the stream from far up the gorge to
  water meadow and orchard, Blue halted and cast a look of disapproval back at
  his rider. Billy Louise stopped singing and laughed at him.</p>

  <p>"I guess you can go where a cow can go, you silly thing. Mud's a heap
  easier than lava rock, if you only knew it, Blue. Get along with you."</p>

  <p>Blue lowered his head, snuffed suspiciously at the water-filled tracks,
  and would have turned back. Mud he despised instinctively, since he had
  nearly mired on the creek bank when he was a sucking colt.</p>

  <p>"Blue! Get across that ditch, or I'll beat you to death!" The voice of
  Billy Louise was soft with a caressing note at the end, so that the threat
  did not sound very savage, after all. She sniffed at the branch of cherry
  blossoms and reined the horse back to face the ditch. And Blue, who had a
  will of his own, snorted and wheeled, this time in frank rebellion against
  her command.</p>

  <p>"Oh, will you? Well, you'll cross that ditch, you know, sooner or
  later&mdash;so you might just as well&mdash;" Blue reared and whirled again,
  plunging two rods back toward the cherry thicket.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise set her teeth against her lower lip, slid her rawhide quirt
  from slim wrist to firm hand-grip, and proceeded to match Blue's obstinacy
  with her own; and since the obstinacy of Billy Louise was stronger and finer
  and backed by a surer understanding of the thing she was fighting against,
  Blue presently lifted himself, leaped the ditch in one clean jump, and
  snorted when he sank nearly to his knees in the soft, black soil beyond.</p>

  <p>From there to the pink drift of peach bloom against the dull brown of the
  bluff, Blue galloped angrily, leaving deep, black prints in the soft green of
  the meadow. So they came headlong upon Marthy, just as she was knocking the
  yellow clay of the grave from her irrigating shovel against the pole fence of
  her pig-pen.</p>

  <p>"Why, Marthy!" Once before in her life Billy Louise had seen Marthy's chin
  quivering like that, and big, slow tears sliding down the network of lines on
  Marthy's leathery cheeks. With a painful slump her spirits went heavy with
  her sympathy. "Marthy!"</p>

  <p>She knew without a word of explanation just what had happened. From
  Marthy's bent shoulders she knew, and from her tear-stained face, and from
  the yellow soil clinging still to the shovel in her hand. The wide eyes of
  Billy Louise sent seeking glances up the slope where the soil was yellow;
  went to the long, raw ridge under the wall, with the peach blossoms standing
  pitifully awry upon the western end. Her eyes filled with tears. "Oh, Marthy!
  When was it?"</p>

  <p>"In the night, sometime, I guess." Marthy's voice had a harsh huskiness.
  "He was&mdash;gone&mdash;when I woke up. Well&mdash;he's better off than I
  be. I dunno what woulda become of him if I'd went first." There, at last, was
  a note of tenderness, stifled though it was and fleeting. "Git down, Billy
  Louise, and come in. I been kinda lookin' for yuh to come, ever sence the
  weather opened up. How's your maw?"</p>

  <p>Spoken sympathy was absolutely impossible in the face of that stoical
  acceptance of life's harsh law. Marthy turned toward the gate, taking the
  shovel and the wheelbarrow in with her. Billy Louise glanced furtively at the
  raw, yellow ridge under the rock wall and rode on to the stable. She pulled
  off the saddle and bridle and turned Blue into the corral before she went
  slowly&mdash;and somewhat reluctantly&mdash;to the cabin, squat, old, and
  unkempt like its mistress, but buried deep in the renewed sweetness of
  bloom-time.</p>

  <p>"The fruit's comin' on early this year," said Marthy from the doorway, her
  hands on her hips. "They's goin' to be lots of it, too, if we don't git a
  killin' frost." So she closed the conversational door upon her sorrow and
  pointed the way to trivial, every-day things.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do now, Marthy?" Billy Louise was perfectly capable
  of opening a conversational door, even when it had been closed decisively in
  her face. "You can't get on here alone, you know. Did you send for that
  nephew? If you haven't, you must hire somebody till&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's comin'. That letter you sent over last month was from him. I dunno
  when he'll git here; he's liable to come most any time. I ain't going to hire
  nobody. I kin git along alone. I might as well of been alone&mdash;" Even
  harsh Marthy hesitated and did not finish the sentence that would have put a
  slight upon her dead.</p>

  <p>"I'll stay to-night, anyway," said Billy Louise. "Just a week ago I hired
  John Pringle and that little breed wife of his for the summer. I couldn't
  afford it," she added, with a small sigh, "but Ward had to go back to his
  claim, and mommie needs someone in the house. She hasn't been a bit well, all
  winter. And I've turned all the stock out for the summer and have to do a lot
  of riding on them; it's that or let them scatter all over the country and
  then have to hire a rep for every round-up. I can't afford that, I haven't
  got cattle enough to pay; and I like to ride, anyway. I've got them pretty
  well located along the creek, up at the head of the canyons. The grass is
  coming on fine, so they don't stray much. Are you going to turn your cattle
  out, Marthy? I see you haven't yet."</p>

  <p>"No, I ain't yit. I dunno. I was going to sell 'em down to jest what the
  pasture'll keep. I'm gittin' too old to look after 'em. But I dunno&mdash;
  When Charlie gits here, mebby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, is that the nephew? I didn't know his name." Billy Louise was talking
  aimlessly to keep her thoughts away from the pitifulness of the sordid little
  tragedy in this beauty-spot and to drive that blank, apathetic look from
  Marthy's hard eyes.</p>

  <p>"Charlie Fox, his name is. I hope he turns out a good worker. I've never
  had a chance to git ahead any; but if Charlie'll jest take holt, I'll mebby
  git some comfort outa life yit."</p>

  <p>"He ought, to, I'm sure. And everyone thinks you've done awfully well,
  Marthy. What can I do now? Wash the dishes and straighten things up, I
  guess."</p>

  <p>"You needn't do nothin' you ain't a mind to do, Billy Louise. I don't want
  you to think you got to slop around washin' my dirty dishes. I'm goin' on
  down into the medder and work on a ditch I'm puttin' in. You jest do what
  you're a mind to." She picked up the shovel and went off down the jungly
  path, herself the ugliest object in the Cove, where she had created so much
  beauty.</p>

  <p>Again the sympathetic soul of Billy Louise had betrayed her into
  performing an extremely disagreeable task. Shudderingly she looked into the
  unpleasant bedroom, and comprehending all of the sordidness of the tragedy,
  spent half an hour with her teeth set hard together while she dragged out
  dingy blankets and hung them over the fence under a voluptuous plum-tree. The
  next hour was so disagreeably employed that she wondered afterward how even
  her sympathy could have driven her to the things she did. She carried more
  water, after she had scrubbed that bedroom, and opened the window with the
  aid of the hammer, and set the tea-kettle on to heat the dish-water. Then,
  because her mind was full of poor, dead Jase, she took the branches of wild
  cherry and hawthorn blossoms she had gathered coming down the gorge and went
  up the slope to lay them on his grave.</p>

  <p>She sat down on the rock where Marthy had rested after digging the grave,
  and with her chin in her two cupped palms, stared out across the river at the
  heaped bluffs and down at the pink-and-white patch of fruit-trees. She was
  trying, as the young will always try, to solve the riddle of life; and she
  was baffled and unhappy because she could not find any answer at all that
  pleased both her ideals and her reason. And then she heard a man's voice
  lifted up in riotous song, and she turned her head toward the opening of the
  gorge and listened, her eyes brightening while she waited.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Foot in the stirrup and hand on the horn,<br>
  Best damn cowboy ever was born,<br>
  Coma ti yi youpy, youpy-a, youpy-a,<br>Coma ti yi youpy, youpy-a!"</p><br>

  <p>Billy Louise, with her chin still in her palms, smiled and hummed the tune
  under her breath; that shows how quickly we throw off the burdens of our
  neighbors. "Wonder what he's doing down here?" she asked herself, and smiled
  again.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"I'll sell my outfit soon as I can,<br>
  I won't punch cattle for no damn' man,<br>
  Coma ti yi youpy, youpy-a, youpy-a,<br>
  Coma ti yi youpy, youpy-a!</p>

  <p class="verse">"I'm goin' back to town to draw my money,<br>
  I'm going back to town to see my honey,<br>
  Coma ti yi&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>Ward came into sight through the little meadow, riding slowly, with both
  hands clasped over the horn of the saddle, his hat tilted back on his head,
  and his whole attitude one of absolute content with life. He saw Billy Louise
  almost as soon as she glimpsed him&mdash;and she had been watching that bit
  of road quite closely. He flipped the reins to one side and turned from the
  trail to ride straight up the slope to where she was.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise, with a self-reproachful glance at the grave, ran down the
  slope to meet him&mdash;an unexpected welcome which made Ward's heart leap in
  his chest.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Ward, for heaven's sake don't be singing that come-all-ye at the top
  of your voice, like that. Don't you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now I was given to understand that you liked that same come-all-ye. Have
  you been educating your musical taste in the last week, Miss William Louisa?"
  Ward stopped his horse before her, and with his hands still clasped over the
  saddle-horn, looked down at her with that hidden smile&mdash;and something
  else.</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't. I don't have to educate myself to the point where I know
  the <i>Chisholm Trail</i> isn't a proper kind of funeral hymn, Ward Warren."
  Billy Louise glanced over her shoulder and lowered her voice instinctively,
  as we all do when death has come close and stopped. "Jase died last night;
  that's his grave up there. Isn't it perfectly pitiful? Poor old Marthy was
  here all solitary alone with him. And&mdash;Ward! She dug that grave her own
  self, and took him up and buried him&mdash;and, Ward! She&mdash;she wheeled
  him up in the&mdash;<i>wheelbarrow</i>! She had to, of course. She couldn't
  carry him. But isn't it awful?" Her hands were up, patting and smoothing the
  neck of his horse, and her face was bent to hide the tears that stood in her
  eyes, and the quiver of her mouth.</p>

  <p>Ward drew in his lip, bit it, and let it go. He was a man, and he had seen
  much of tragedy and trouble; also, he did not know Marthy or Jase. His chief
  emotion was one of resentment against anything that brought tears to Billy
  Louise; she had not hidden them from him; they were the first and most
  important element in that day's happenings, so far as he was concerned. He
  leaned and flipped the end of his reins lightly down on her bare head.</p>

  <p>"William Louisa, if you cry about it, I'll&mdash;do something shocking,
  most likely. Yes, it's awful; a whole lot of life is awful. But it's done,
  and Mrs. Martha appears to be a woman with a whole lot of grit, so the
  chances are she'll carry her load like a man. She'll be horribly lonesome,
  down here! They lived alone, didn't they?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and they didn't seem to love each other much." Billy Louise was not
  one to gloss over hard facts, even in the face of that grave. "Marthy was
  always kicking about him, and he about her. But all the same they belonged
  together; they had lived together more years than we are old. And she's going
  to miss him awfully."</p>

  <p>Several minutes they stood there, talking, while Billy Louise patted the
  horse absently, and Ward looked down at her and did not miss one little light
  or shadow in her face. He had been alone a whole week, thinking of her,
  remember, and his eyes were hungry to the point of starvation.</p>

  <p>"You saw mommie, of course; you came from home?"</p>

  <p>"No, I did not. I got as far as the creek and saw Blue's tracks coming
  down; so I just sort of trailed along, seeing it was mommie's daughter I felt
  most like talking to."</p>

  <p>"Mommie's daughter" laughed a little and instinctively made a change in
  the subject. She did not see anything strange in the fact that Ward had
  observed and recognized Blue's tracks coming into the gorge. She would have
  observed and recognized instantly the tracks made by his horse, anywhere.
  Those things come natural to one who has lived much in the open; and there is
  a certain individuality in the hoof-prints of a horse, as any plainsman can
  testify.</p>

  <p>"I've got to go in and wash the dishes," she said, stepping back from him.
  "Of course nothing was done in the cabin, and I've been doing a little
  house-cleaning. I guess the dish-water is hot by this time&mdash;if it hasn't
  all boiled away."</p>

  <p>Ward, as a matter of course, tied his horse to the fence and went into the
  cabin with her. He also asked her to stake him to a dish-towel, which she did
  after a good deal of rummaging. He stood with his hat on the back of his
  head, a cigarette between his lips, and wiped the dishes with much apparent
  enjoyment. He objected strongly to Billy Louise's assertion that she meant to
  scrub the floor, but when he found her quite obdurate, he changed his method
  without in the least degree yielding his point, though for diplomatic reasons
  he appeared to yield.</p>

  <p>He carried water from the creek and filled the tea-kettle, the big iron
  pot, and both pails. Then, when Billy Louise had turned her back upon him,
  while she looked in a dark corner for the mop, he suddenly seized her under
  the arms and lifted her upon the table; and before she had finished her
  astonished gaspings, he caught up a pail of water and sloshed it upon the
  floor under her. Then he grinned in his triumph.</p>

  <p>"William Louisa, if you get your feet wet, your mommie will take a club to
  you," he reminded her sternly. Whereupon he took the broom and proceeded to
  give that floor a real man's scrubbing, refusing to quarrel with Billy
  Louise, who scolded like a cross old woman from the table&mdash;except when
  she simply had to stop and laugh heartily at his violent method of
  cleaning.</p>

  <p>Ward sloshed and swept and scrubbed. He dug into the corners with a grim
  thoroughness that won reluctant approbation from the young woman on the table
  with her feet tucked under her, and he made her forget poor old Jase up on
  the hillside. He scrubbed viciously behind the door until the water was
  little better than a thin, black mud.</p>

  <p>"You want to come up to my claim some time," he said, looking over his
  shoulder while he rested a minute. "I'll show you how a man keeps house,
  William Louisa. Once a week I pile my two stools on the table, put the cat up
  on the bunk&mdash;and she looks just about as comfortable and happy as
  mommie's daughter looks right now&mdash;and get busy with the broom and good
  creek water." He resettled his hat on the back of his head and went to work
  again. "Mill Creek goes dry down below, on the days when little Wardie cleans
  his cabin," he assured her gravely, and damming up a muddy pool with the
  broom, he yanked open the door and swept out the water with a perfectly
  unnecessary flourish, just because he happened to be in a very exuberant
  mood.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise gave a squeal of consternation and then sat absolutely still,
  staring round-eyed through the doorway. Ward stepped back&mdash;even his
  composure was slightly jarred&mdash;and twisted his lips amusedly.</p>

  <p>"Hello," he said, after a few blank seconds. "You missed some of it,
  didn't you?" His tone was mildly commiserating. "Will you come in?"</p>

  <p>"N-o-o, thank you, I don't believe I will." The speaker looked in,
  however, saw Billy Louise perched upon the table, and took off his hat. He
  was well plastered with dirty water that ran down and left streaks of mud
  behind. "I must have gotten off the road," he said. "I'm looking for Mr.
  Jason Meilke's ranch."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise tucked her feet farther under her skirts and continued to
  stare dumbly. Ward, glancing at her from the corner of his eyes, stepped
  considerately between her and the stranger so that his broad shoulders quite
  hid her from the man's curious stare.</p>

  <p>"You've struck the right place," he said calmly. "This is it." He picked
  up another pail of water and sloshed it upon the wet floor to rinse off the
  mud.</p>

  <p>"Is&mdash;ah&mdash;Mrs. Meilke in?" One could not accuse the young man of
  craning, but he certainly did try to get another glimpse of the person on the
  table and failed because of Ward.</p>

  <p>"She's down in the meadow," Billy Louise murmured.</p>

  <p>"She's down in the meadow," Ward repeated to the bespattered young man.
  "You just go down past the stable and follow on down&mdash;" he waved a hand
  vaguely before he took up the broom again. "You'll find her, all right," he
  added encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Ward! That must be Marthy's nephew. What will he think?"</p>

  <p>"Does it matter such a h&mdash;a deuce of a lot what he thinks?" Ward went
  on with his interrupted scrubbing.</p>

  <p>"His name is Charlie Fox, and he's been to college and he worked in a
  bank," Billy Louise went on nervously. "He's going to live here with Marthy
  and run the ranch. What must he have thought! To have you sweep all that
  dirty water on him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not all!" Ward corrected cheerfully. "Quite a lot missed him."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise giggled. "What does he look like, Ward? You stood squarely in
  the way, so I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He looked," said Ward dispassionately, "like a pretty mad young man with
  nose, eyes, and a mouth, and a mole in front of his left ear."</p>

  <p>"He was real polite," said Billy Louise reprovingly, "and his voice is
  nice."</p>

  <p>"Yes? I mind-read a heap of cussing. The politeness was all on top." Ward
  chuckled and swept more water outside. "I expect you saved me a licking that
  time, Miss William the Conqueror."</p>

  <p>"Can you think of any more names to call me, besides my own, I wonder?"
  Billy Louise leaned and inspected the floor like a chicken preparing to hop
  off its roost.</p>

  <p>"Heaps more." The glow in Ward's eyes was dangerous to their calm
  friendship. "Want to hear them?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't. I want to get off this table before that college youth comes
  back to be shocked silly again. I want to see if he's really&mdash;got a mole
  in front of his ear!"</p>

  <p>"You know what inquisitiveness did to old lady Lot, don't you?
  However&mdash;" He lifted her in his arms and set her down outside the door.
  "There, Wilhemina; trot along and see the nice young man."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise sat down on the wheelbarrow, remembered its latest service,
  and got up hastily. "I won't go a step," she asserted positively.</p>

  <p>Ward had not wanted her to go. He gave her a smile and finished off his
  scrubbing with the mop, which he handled with quite surprising skill for a
  young man who seemed more at home in the saddle than anywhere else.</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully glad he came, anyway." Billy Louise pulled down a budded
  lilac branch and sniffed at it. "I won't have to stay all night, now. I was
  going to."</p>

  <p>"In that case, the young man is welcome as a gold mine. Here they
  come&mdash;he and Mrs. Martha. You'll have to introduce me, Bill-the-Conk; I
  have never met the lady." Ward hastily returned the mop to its corner, rolled
  down his sleeves, and picked up his gloves. Then he stepped outside and
  waited beside Billy Louise, looking not in the least like a man who has just
  wiped a lot of dishes and scrubbed a floor.</p>

  <p>The nephew, striding along behind Marthy and showing head and shoulders
  above her, seemed not to resent any little mischance, such as muddy water
  flirted upon him from a broom. He grinned reminiscently as he came up, shook
  hands with the two of them, and did not let his glance dwell too long or too
  often upon Billy Louise, nor too briefly upon Ward.</p>

  <p>"You've got a splendid place here, Aunt Martha," he told the old woman
  appreciatively. "I'd no idea there was such a little beauty-spot down here.
  This is even more picturesque than that homey-looking ranch we passed a few
  miles back, down in that little valley. I was hoping that was your ranch when
  I first saw it; and when I found it wasn't, I came near stopping, anyway. I'm
  glad I resisted the temptation, now. This is worth coming a long way to
  see."</p>

  <p>"I ain't never had a chance to do all I wanted to with it," said Marthy,
  with the first hint of apology Billy Louise had ever heard from her. "I only
  had one pair of hands to work with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We'll fix that part. Don't you worry a minute. You're going to sit in a
  rocking-chair and give orders, from now on. And if I can't make good here, I
  ought to be booted all the way up that spooky gorge. Isn't that right?" He
  turned to Warren with a certain air of appraisement behind the unmistakable
  cordiality of his voice.</p>

  <p>"A man ought to make good here, all right," Ward agreed neutrally. "It's a
  fine place."</p>

  <p>"It ain't as fine as I'd like to see it," began Marthy depreciatingly.</p>

  <p>"As you will see it, let's say&mdash;if that doesn't sound too conceited
  from a tenderfoot," supplemented the nephew, and laid his hand upon her
  shoulder with a gentle little pat. "Folks, I don't want to seem too
  exuberantly sure of myself, but&mdash;" he waved a carefully-kept hand
  eloquently at the luxuriance around him, "&mdash;I'm all fussed up over this
  place, honest. I thought I was coming to a shack in the middle of the
  sage-brush; I was primed to buckle down and make good even in the desert. And
  bumping into this sort of thing without warning has gone to my alleged brain
  a bit. What I don't know about ranching would fill a library; but there's
  this much, anyway. There won't be any more ditch-digging for a certain game
  little lady in this Cove." He gave the shoulder another pat, and he smiled
  down at her in a way that made Billy Louise blink. And Marthy, who had
  probably never before been called a game little lady, came near breaking down
  and crying before them all.</p>

  <p>When Ward went to the stable after Blue, half an hour later, Charlie Fox
  went with him. His manner when they were alone was different; not so
  exuberantly cheerful&mdash;more frank and practical.</p>

  <p>"Honest, it floored me completely to see what that poor old woman has been
  up against down here," he told Warren, stuffing tobacco into a silver-rimmed,
  briar pipe while Ward saddled Blue. "I don't know a hell of a lot about this
  ranch game; but if that old lady can put it across, I guess I can wobble
  along somehow. Too bad the old man cashed in just now; but Aunt Martha as
  good as told me he wasn't much force, so maybe I can play a lone hand here as
  easy as I could have done with him. Live near here?"</p>

  <p>"Fifteen miles or so." Ward was not in his most expansive mood, chiefly
  for the reason that this man was a stranger, and of strangers he was inclined
  to fight shy.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well&mdash;it might have been fifty. I know how you fellows measure
  distances out here. I'm likely to need a little coaching, now and then, if I
  live up to what I just now told the old lady."</p>

  <p>"From all I know of her, you won't need to go out of the Cove for
  advice."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's right, judging from the looks of things. A woman that can go
  up against a proposition like she did to-day and handle it alone, is no
  mental weakling; to say nothing of the way this ranch looks. All right,
  Warren; I'll make out alone, I reckon."</p>

  <p>Afterwards, when Ward thought it over, he remembered gratefully that
  Charlie Fox had refrained from attempting any discussion of Billy Louise or
  from asking any questions even remotely personal. He knew enough about men to
  appreciate the tactful silences of the stranger, and when Billy Louise, on
  the way home, predicted that the nephew was going to be a success, Ward did
  not feel like qualifying the verdict.</p>

  <p>"He's going to be a godsend to the old lady," he said. "He seems to have
  his sights raised to making things come easier for her from now on."</p>

  <p>"Well, she certainly deserves it. For a college young man&mdash;the
  ordinary, smart young man who comes out here to astonish the
  natives&mdash;he's almost human. I was so afraid that Marthy'd get him out
  here and then discover he was a perfect nuisance. So many men are."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; A MATTER OF TWELVE MONTHS OR SO</h2>

  <p class="first">OUT in the wide spaces, where homes are but scattered oases
  in the general emptiness, life does not move uniformly, so far as it concerns
  incidents or acquaintanceships. A man or a ranch may experience complete
  isolation, and the unbroken monotony which sometimes accompanies it, for a
  month at a time. Summer work or winter storm may be the barrier temporarily
  raised, and life resolves itself into a succession of days and nights
  unbroken by outside influences. They leave their mark upon humans&mdash;these
  periods of isolation. For better, for worse, the man changes slowly with the
  months; he grows more bovine in his phlegmatic acceptance of his environment,
  or he becomes restless and fired with a surplus energy of ambition, or he
  falls to dreaming dreams; whatever angle he takes, he changes, imperceptibly
  perhaps, but inevitably.</p>

  <p>Then the monotony is broken and sometimes with violence. Incident rushes
  in upon the heels of incident, and life becomes as tumultuous as the many
  moods of nature when it has a wide, open land for a playground.</p>

  <p>That is why, perhaps, so much of western life is painted with broad
  strokes and raw colors. You are given the crowded action, the unleashing of
  emotions and temperaments that have smoldered long under the blanket of
  solitary living. You are shown an effect without being given the cause of
  that effect. You pronounce the West wild, and you never think of the long
  winters that bred in silence and brooding solitude those storm-periods which
  seem so primitively savage; of the days wherein each nature is thrown upon
  its own resources, with nothing to feed upon but itself and its own personal
  interests. And so characters change, and one wonders why.</p>

  <p>There was Billy Louise, with her hands and her mind full of the problems
  her father had died still trying to solve. She did not in the least realize
  that she was attempting anything out of the ordinary when she took a
  half-developed ranch in the middle of a land almost as wild as it had been
  when the Indians wandered over it unmolested, a few cattle and horses and a
  bundle of debts to make her head swim, and set herself the problem of
  increasing the number of cattle and eliminating the debts, and of wresting
  prosperity out of a condition of picturesquely haphazard poverty. She went
  about it with the pathetic confidence of youth and ignorance. She rode up and
  down the canyons and over the higher, grassier ridges, to watch the cattle on
  their summer range and keep them from straying. She went with John Pringle
  after posts and helped him fence certain fertile slopes and hollows for
  winter grazing. She drove the rickety old mower through the waving grass
  along the creek bottom and hummed little, contented tunes while she watched
  the grass sway and fall evenly when the sickle shuttled through. She put on
  her gymnasium bloomers and drove the hay wagon, and felt only a pleasurable
  thrill of excitement when John Pringle inadvertently pitched an indignant
  rattlesnake up to her with a forkful of hay. She killed the snake with her
  pitchfork and pinched off the rattles, proud of their size and number.</p>

  <p>When she sold seven fat, three-year-old steers that fall and paid a note
  twice renewed, managing besides to buy the winter supply of "grub" and a
  sewing-machine and a set of silver teaspoons for her mother, oh, but she was
  proud! Ward rode down to the ranch that night, and Billy Louise showed him
  the note with its red stamp, oblong and imposing and slightly blurred on the
  "paid" side. Ward was almost as proud as she, if looks and tones went for
  anything, and he helped Billy Louise a good deal by telling her just how much
  she ought to pay for the yearlings old Johnson, over on Snake River, had for
  sale. Also he told her how much hay it would take to winter them&mdash;though
  she knew that already&mdash;and just what percentage of profit she might
  expect from a given number in a given period of time.</p>

  <p>He spoke of his own work and plans, as well. He was going into cattle,
  also, as fast as possible, he said. In a few years the sheep would probably
  come in and crowd them out, but in the meantime there was money in
  cattle&mdash;and the more cattle, the more money. He was going to work for
  wages till the winter set in. He didn't know when he would see Billy Louise,
  he said, but he would stop on his way back.</p>

  <p>To them that short visit was something more than an incident. It gave Ward
  new stuff for his dreams and new fuel for the fire of ambition. To Billy
  Louise it also furnished new dream material. She rode the hills and saw in
  fancy whole herds of cattle where now wandered scattered animals. She dreamed
  of the time when Ward and Charlie Fox and she would pool their interests and
  run a wagon of their own, and gather their stock from wide ranges. She was
  foolish, in that; but that is what she liked to dream.</p>

  <p>Mentioning Charlie Fox calls to mind the fact that he was changing more
  than any of them. Billy Louise did not see him very often, but when she did
  it was with a deepening impression of his unflagging tenderness to
  Marthy&mdash;a tenderness that manifested itself in many little, unassuming
  thoughtfulnesses&mdash;and of his good-humor and his energy and several other
  qualities which one must admire.</p>

  <p>"Mommie, that nephew goes at everything just as if it were a game," she
  said after one visit. "You know what that cabin has always been: dark and
  dirty and not a comfortable chair to sit down in, or a book or magazine or
  anything? Well, I'm just going to take you over there some day and let you
  see the difference. He's cut two more windows and built on an addition with a
  porch, if you please. And he has a bookcase he made himself, just stuffed
  with books and magazines. And he made Marthy a rocking-chair, mommie,
  and&mdash;she wears a white apron, and has her hair combed, and sits and
  rocks! Honest to goodness, you wouldn't think she was the same woman."</p>

  <p>"Marthy always seemed to me more like a man than a woman," said her
  mother. "She didn't have nothing domestic in her whole make-up, far as I
  could see. Her cooking&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, mommie, Marthy cooks real well now. Charlie praises up her bread,
  and she takes lots of pains with it. And she just fusses with her flowers and
  lets him run the ranch; and, mommie, she just worships Charlie! The way she
  sits and looks at him when he's talking&mdash;you can see she almost says
  prayers to him. She does let her dishpan stay greasy&mdash;I don't suppose
  you can change a person completely&mdash;but everything is lots cleaner than
  it used to be before Charlie came. He's going to buy more cattle, too, he
  says. Young stock, mostly. He says there's no sense in anybody being poor, in
  such a country as this. He says he intends to make Marthy rich; Aunt Martha,
  he calls her. I'm certainly going to take you over to see her, mommie, the
  very first nice day when I don't have a million other things to do." Billy
  Louise sighed and pushed her hair back impatiently. "I wish I were a man and
  as smart as Charlie Fox," she added, with the plaintive note that now
  sometimes crept into her voice when she realized of a sudden how great a load
  she was carrying.</p>

  <p>"A man can get out and do things. And a woman&mdash;why, even Ward seems
  to think it's perfectly wonderful, mommie, that we don't just about starve,
  with me running the ranch! I know he does. Every time I do a thing right or
  pay off a note or anything, he looks as if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't be a mite surprised, Billy Louise," said her mother, with a
  flash of amused comprehension, "if you kinda misread Ward sometimes. Them
  eyes of his are pretty keen, and they see a whole lot; but they ain't easy to
  read, for all that. I guess Ward don't think it's anything surprising that
  you're getting along so well, Billy Louise. I surmise he knows you're a
  better manager than a lot of men are."</p>

  <p>"I'm not the manager Charlie Fox is, though." Billy Louise was frankly
  envious.</p>

  <p>"He didn't have any more to do with than I've got, and he's accomplished a
  lot more. And, besides, he started in green at the whole business." She
  rested her chin in her cupped palms and stared disconsolately at the
  high-piled hills behind which the sun was setting gloriously. "He's going to
  pipe water into the house, mommie," she observed, after a silence. "I
  wish&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, he's welcome. I don't want no water piped in here, Billy Louise,
  and tastin' of the pipe. I'd rather carry it and have it sweet and fresh.
  Don't you go worrying because you can't do everything Charlie Fox does.
  Likely as not he's pilin' up the debts instead of payin' 'em off as you're
  doing."</p>

  <p>"I don't know; I don't believe he is, though. I think he's just managing
  right and making every dollar count. He got calves from Seabeck, up the
  river, cheaper than I did from Johnson, mommie. He rode all over the country
  and looked up range conditions and prices. He didn't say so, but he made me
  feel foolish because I just bought the first ones I saw, without waiting to
  look around first. But&mdash;Ward said it was a good buy, and he ought to
  know; only, the fact remains that Charlie has done better. I guess it isn't
  experience that counts, altogether. Charlie Fox has got brains!"</p>

  <p>"Land alive! I guess he ain't the only one, Billy Louise. You're doing
  better than your father done, and he wasn't any Jase Meilke kind of a man,
  but a good, hard worker always. You don't want to get all outa conceit with
  yourself just because Charlie Fox is gitting along all right. I don't know as
  it's so wonderful. Marthy was always forehanded, and she made money there and
  never spent any to speak of. Though I shouldn't carry the idea she's stingy,
  after the way she&mdash;"</p>

  <p>If Billy Louise had not been so absorbed with her own discontent, she
  might have wondered at her mother's sudden silence. But she did not even
  notice it. She was comparing two young men and measuring them with certain
  standards of her own, and she was not quite satisfied with the result. She
  had seen Charlie Fox spring up with a perfectly natural courtesy and hand
  Marthy a chair when she entered the room where he had been discussing books
  with Billy Louise. She had seen him stand beside his own chair until Marthy
  was seated and then had heard him deftly turn the conversation into a channel
  wherein Marthy had also an interest. Parlor politeness&mdash;and something
  more; something infinitely finer and better than mere obedience to certain
  conventional rules.</p>

  <p>She had seen that and more, and she had a vivid picture of Ward, sitting
  absorbed in a book which he never afterwards mentioned, and letting her or
  her mother lift heavy pieces of wood upon the fire within arm's reach of him;
  sitting with his hat tilted back upon his head and a cigarette gone cold in
  his fingers, and perhaps not replying at all when he was spoken to. She had
  never considered him uncouth or rude; he was Ward Warren, and these were
  certain individual traits which he possessed and which seemed a part of him.
  She had sensed dimly that some natures are too big and too strong for petty
  rules of deportment, and that Ward might sit all day in the house with his
  hat on his head and still be a gentleman of the finer sort. And yet, now that
  Charlie Fox had come and presented an example of the world's standard, Billy
  Louise could not, for the life of her, help wishing that Ward was different.
  And there were other things; things which Billy Louise was ashamed to
  recognize as influencing her in any way, and yet which did influence her. For
  instance, Ward lived to himself and for himself, and not always wisely or
  well. He was arrogant in his opinions&mdash;Billy Louise had rather admired
  what she had called his strength, but it had become arrogance now&mdash;and
  his scorn was swift and keen for blunderings. And there was Charlie, always
  thinking and planning for Marthy and putting her wishes first; wanting to
  make sure that he himself had not blundered, and with a conservative estimate
  of himself that was refreshingly modest. And&mdash; "Ain't that Ward coming,
  Billy Louise? Seems to me it looks like him&mdash;the way he rides."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise started guiltily and looked up toward the trail, now piled
  deep with shadows. It was Ward, all right, and his voice, lifted in a
  good-humored shout, brought Billy Louise to her feet and sent her down the
  slope to the stable, where he had stopped as a matter of course.</p>

  <p>When he turned and smiled at her through the dusk and said, "'Lo, Bill,"
  in a voice that was like a spoken kiss, a certain young woman hated herself
  for a weak-souled traitor and mentally called Charlie Fox a popinjay, which
  was merely shifting injustice to another resting-place.</p>

  <p>"Are you plumb tickled to death to see me, William?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no; but I guess I can stand it!"</p>

  <p>A smile to go with both sentences, and a strong undercurrent of something
  unnamed in their tones&mdash;who wanted the pasteurized milk and distilled
  water of a perfectly polite form of greeting? Not Billy Louise, if one might
  judge from that young woman's face and voice and manner. Not Ward, though he
  was perfectly unconscious of having been weighed or measured or judged by any
  standard at all.</p>

  <p>And yet, when Charlie Fox rode down to the Wolverine a week or so later,
  tied his horse under the shed, and came up to the cabin as though he knew of
  no better place in all the world; when he greeted mommie as though she were
  something precious in his sight, and talked with her about the things she was
  most interested in, and actually made her feel as if he were immensely
  interested also, Billy Louise simply could not help admiring him and liking
  him for his frank good-nature and his kindness. She had never before met a
  man just like Charlie Fox, though she had known many who were what Ward once
  called "parlor-broke." She felt when she was with him that he had a strength
  to match Ward's strength; only, this strength was tamed and trained and
  smoothed so that it did not obtrude upon one's notice. It was not every young
  man who would come out into the wilderness and roughen his hands on an
  irrigating shovel and live a cramped, lonely life, for the sake of a harsh,
  illiterate old woman like Marthy Meilke. She did not believe Ward would do
  that. He would have to feel some tie stronger than the one between Marthy and
  her nephew before he would change his life and his own plans for anyone.</p>

  <p>It was not until Charlie was leaving that he gave Billy Louise a hint that
  his errand was not yet accomplished. She walked down with him to where his
  horse was tied and so gave him a chance to speak what was in his mind.</p>

  <p>"You know, I hate to mention little worries before your mother," he said.
  "Those pathetic eyes of hers make me ashamed to bother her with a thing. But
  I am worried, Miss Louise. I came over to ask you if you've seen anything of
  four calves of ours. I know you ride a good deal, through the hills. They
  disappeared a week ago, and I can't find any trace of them. I've been looking
  all through the hills, but I can't locate them."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise had not seen them, either, and she begged for particulars. "I
  don't see how they could get away from your Cove," she said, "unless your
  bars were down."</p>

  <p>"The bars were all right. It was last Friday, I think. I'm not sure. They
  were in the little meadow above the house, you see. I was away that night,
  and Aunt Martha is a little hard of hearing. She wouldn't hear anything
  unless there were considerable noise. I came home the next forenoon&mdash;I
  was over to Seabeck's&mdash;and the bars were in place then. Aunt Martha had
  not been up the gorge, nor had anyone come to the ranch while I was gone. So
  you see, Miss Louise, here's a very pretty mystery!"</p>

  <p>He laughed, but Billy Louise saw by his eyes that he did not laugh very
  deeply, and that he was really worried. "I must have made a mistake and
  bought mountain sheep instead of calves," he said and laughed again. "They
  couldn't have gone through those bars or over them; and I did have a spark of
  intelligence and looked along the river for tracks, you know. They had not
  been near the river, which has soft banks along there. They watered from the
  little creek that comes down the gorge. Miss Louise, do you have flying
  cattle in Idaho?"</p>

  <p>"You think they were driven off, don't you?" Billy Louise asked a question
  with the words, and made a statement of it with her tone, which was a trick
  of hers.</p>

  <p>Charlie Fox shook his head, but his eyes did not complete the denial.
  "Miss Louise, I'd work every other theory to death before I'd admit that
  possibility! I don't know all of my neighbors so very well, but I should
  hesitate a long, long time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It needn't have been a neighbor. There are lots of strange men passing
  through the country. Did you look for tracks?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;did not. I didn't want to admit that possibility. I decline to
  admit it now." The chin of Charlie Fox squared perceptibly, so that Billie
  Louise caught a faint resemblance to Marthy in his face. "I saw a man accused
  of a theft once," he said. "The evidence was&mdash;or seemed&mdash;absolutely
  unassailable. And afterward he was exonerated completely; it was just a
  horrible mistake. But he left school under a cloud. His life was ruined by
  the blunder. I'd have to know absolutely before I'd accuse anyone of stealing
  those calves, Miss Louise. I'd have to see them in a man's corral, with his
  brand on them&mdash;I believe that's the way it's done, out here&mdash;and
  even then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where have you looked?" There were reasons why this particular subject
  was painful to Billy Louise. "And are you sure they didn't get out of that
  pasture and wander on down the Cove, among all those willows? It's a perfect
  jungle, away down. Are you sure they aren't with the rest of the cattle? I
  don't see how they could leave the Cove, unless they were driven out." She
  caught a twinkle of amusement in his eyes and stopped short. Of course, a
  mere girl should not take it for granted that a man had failed to do all that
  might be done. And Billy Louise had a swift conviction that she would never
  think of talking like this to Ward. She flushed a little; and still, Charlie
  Fox was a tenderfoot. She was justified in asking those questions, and in her
  heart she knew it.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I thought of that&mdash;strange as it may seem." Charlie's voice was
  unoffended. On the contrary, he seemed glad that she took so keen an interest
  in his affairs. "It has been a week, you know, since they flew the coop. I
  did hunt every foot of that Cove, twice over. I drove every hoof of stock up
  and corraled them, and made sure these four were not in the herd. Then I
  hunted through every inch of that willow jungle and all along the bluff and
  the river; Miss Louise, I put in three days at it, from sunrise till it was
  too dark to see. Then I began riding outside. There isn't a trace of them
  anywhere. I had just bought them from Seabeck, you know. I drove them home,
  and because they were tired, and so was I, I just left them in that upper
  meadow as I came down the gorge. I hadn't branded them yet. I&mdash;I know
  I've made an awful botch of the thing, Miss Louise," he confessed, turning
  toward her with an honest distress and a self-flaying humility in his eyes
  that wiped from Billy Louise's mind any incipient tendency toward contempt.
  "But you see I'm green at this ranch game. And I never dreamed those calves
  weren't perfectly safe in there. The fence was new and strong; I built it new
  this fall, you know. And the bars are absolutely bars to any stock larger
  than a rabbit. Of course," he added, with a deprecating note, "four calves
  are only four calves. But&mdash;it's the sense of failure that gets me
  hardest, Miss Louise. Aunt Martha trusted me to take care of things. Her
  confidence in me fairly takes my nerve. And losing four fine, big heifer
  calves at one whack is no way to get rich; is it, Miss Louise?" He laughed,
  and again the laugh did not go deep, or reach his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I hate to bother you with this, and I don't want you to think I have come
  whining for sympathy," he said, after a minute of moody silence. "But seeing
  they were not branded yet&mdash;with our brand&mdash;I thought perhaps you
  had run across them and paid no attention, thinking they belonged to
  Seabeck."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise smiled a little to herself. If he had not been quite so
  "green at the ranch game," he would have mentioned brands at first, as the
  most important point, instead of tacking on the information casually after
  ten minutes of other less vital details.</p>

  <p>"Were they vented?" she asked, suppressing the smile so that it was merely
  a twitch of the lips which might mean anything.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;yes, I think they were. That's what you call it when the former
  owner puts his brand in a different place to show that his ownership has
  ceased, isn't it? Seabeck puts his brand upside down&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know Seabeck's vent," Billy Louise cut in. There was no need of letting
  such a fine fellow display more ignorance on the subject. "And I should have
  noticed it if I had seen four calves vented fresh and not rebranded. Why in
  the world didn't you stick your brand on at the same time?" Billy Louise was
  losing patience with his greenness.</p>

  <p>"I didn't have my branding iron with me," Charlie answered humbly. "I have
  done that before, when I bought those other cows and calves. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'd better pack your iron, next time," she retorted. "If you can't get
  a little bunch of calves ten miles without losing them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you must understand, I did! I took them home and turned them into the
  Cove. I know&mdash;I'm an awful chump at this. There are things that I can
  do," he declared whimsically, "or I should want to kick myself to death. I
  can ladle out money the year round through a bank wicket and not be shy a
  cent at the end of the year. And I can strike out man after man&mdash;when
  I'm in good form; why, I've pitched whole games and never walked a man! And I
  can&mdash;but what's the use? I can't drive the cows up from pasture, it
  seems, without losing all the milk. And I can make a little, gray-eyed girl
  out here in the sagebrush look upon me with pitying contempt for my asinine
  ignorance. Hang it, why does a fellow have to learn fresh lessons for
  everything he undertakes? Why can't there be a universal course that fits one
  for every trade?"</p>

  <p>"There is," said Billy Louise dryly. "You take that in the School of
  Experience, don't you?"</p>

  <p>He laughed ruefully. "Horatio! It certainly does cost something, though.
  I've certainly paid enough&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In worry, maybe. The calves may not be absolutely lost, you know. Why, I
  lost a big steer last spring and never found him till I was going to sell a
  few head. Then he turned up, the biggest and fattest one in the bunch. You
  can't tell; they get themselves in queer places sometimes. I'll come over
  to-morrow, if I can, and take a look at that pasture and all around. And I'll
  keep a good lookout for the calves."</p>

  <p>Many men would have objected to the unconscious patronage of her tone.
  That Charlie Fox did not, but accepted the spirit of helpfulness in her
  words, lifted him out of the small-natured class.</p>

  <p>"It's awfully good of you," he said. "You know a lot more about the bovine
  nature than I do, for all I put in every spare minute studying the subject.
  I'm taking four different stock journals now, Miss Louise. I'll bet I know a
  lot more about the different strains of various breeds than you do, Miss
  Cattle-queen. But I'm beginning to see that we only know what we learn by
  experience. I've a new book on the subject of heredity of the cattle. I'm
  going home and see if Seabeck hasn't stumbled upon a strain that can be
  traced back to your native mountain sheep."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise laughed and said good-by, and stood leaning over the gate
  watching him as he zigzagged up the hill, stopping his horse often to
  breathe. The wagon road took a round-about course, longer and less steep. At
  the top, just before he rounded a huge pimple on the face of the bluff, he
  stopped and looked down, saw her standing there, and waved his hat. His horse
  stood sidewise upon the trail for easier footing, and the man's head and
  shoulders were silhouetted sharply against the deep, clear blue of the sky.
  Billy Louise felt a little, unnamed thrill as she stared up at him. Her lips
  curved into tenderness. Clean, frank, easy-natured he was, as she had come to
  know him. It was like coming into a sunny spot to be with him. And then she
  sighed, with that vague feeling of dissatisfaction with herself. She felt
  crude and awkward and dull of wit. Her mother, Marthy, Ward&mdash;all the
  persons she knew&mdash;were crude and awkward and ignorant beside Charlie
  Fox. And she had had the temerity, the insufferable effrontery, to criticize
  him and patronize him over those four calves! "He can strike out three men in
  succession," she murmured. "And he pitched whole games and never walked a
  man." She gave him a final wave of the hand, as he turned to climb on out of
  sight. "And I don't even know what he was talking about&mdash;though I think
  it was baseball. And I was awfully snippy about those calves he lost."</p>

  <p>She began to wonder, then, about those calves. Vented and not rebranded,
  they would be easy game for any man who first got his own brand on them. She
  meant to get a description of them when she saw Charlie again&mdash;it was
  like his innocence to forget the most essential details!&mdash;and she meant
  to keep her eyes open. If Charlie were right about the calves not being
  anywhere in the Cove, then they had been driven out of it, stolen. Billy
  Louise turned dejectedly away from the fence and went down to a shady nook by
  the creek, where she had always liked to do her worrying and hard
  thinking.</p>

  <p>She stooped and tried to catch a baby trout in her cupped palms, just as
  she used to try when she was a child. If those four calves were stolen, then
  there was a "rustler" in the country. And if there were, then no one's stock
  was safe. The deduction was terribly simple and as exact as the smallest sum
  in addition. And Billy Louise could not afford to pay toll to a rustler out
  of her forty-seven head of cattle.</p>

  <p>The next day she rode early to the Cove and learned some things from
  Marthy which she had not gleaned from Charlie. She learned that two of the
  calves were a deep red, except for a wide, white strip on the nose of one and
  white hind feet on the other; that another was spotted on the hindquarters,
  and that the fourth was white, with large, red blotches. She had known cattle
  all her life. She would know these, if she saw them anywhere.</p>

  <p>She also discovered for herself that they could not have broken out of
  that pasture, and that the river bank was impassable, because of high, thick
  bushes and miry mud in the open spaces. She had a fight with Blue over these
  latter places and demonstrated beyond doubt that they were miry, by getting
  him in to the knees in spite of his violent objections. They left deep tracks
  behind them when they got out. The calves had not gone investigating the
  bank, for there was not a trace anywhere. And the bluff was absolutely
  unscalable. Billy Louise herself would have felt doubtful of climbing out
  that way. The gray rim-rock stood straight and high at the top, with never a
  crevice, so far as she could see. And the gorge was barred, so that it was
  impossible to go that way without lifting heavy poles out of deep sockets and
  sliding them to one side.</p>

  <p>"I've got an idea about a gate here," Charlie confided suddenly. "There
  won't be any more mysteries like this. I'm going to fix a swinging gate in
  place of these bars, Miss Louise. I shall have it swing uphill, like this;
  and I'll have a weight arranged so that it will always close itself, if one
  is careless enough to ride on and leave it open. I have it all worked out in
  my alleged brain. I shall do it right away, too. Aunt Marthy is rather
  nervous about this gorge, now. Every evening she walks up here herself to
  make sure the bars are closed."</p>

  <p>"You may as well make up your mind to it," said Billy Louise irrelevantly,
  in a tone of absolute certainty. "Those calves were driven out of the gorge.
  That means stolen. You needn't accuse anyone in particular; I don't suppose
  you could. But they were stolen."</p>

  <p>Charlie frowned and glanced up speculatively at the bluff's rim.</p>

  <p>"Oh, your mountain-sheep theory is no good," Billy Louise giggled. "I
  doubt if a lizard, even, would try to leave the Cove over the bluff." Which
  certainly was a sweeping statement, when you consider a lizard's habits. "A
  mountain sheep couldn't, anyway."</p>

  <p>"They're hummers to climb&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But calves are not, Mr. Fox! Not like that. You know yourself they were
  stolen; why not admit it?"</p>

  <p>"Would that do any good&mdash;bring them back?" he countered, looking up
  at her.</p>

  <p>"N-o, but I do hate to see a person deliberately shut his eyes in front of
  a fact. We may as well admit to ourselves that there is a rustler in the
  country. Then we can look out for him."</p>

  <p>Charlie's eyes had the troubled look. "I hate to think that. Aunt Martha
  insists that is what we are up against, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, she knows more about it than you do, believe me. If you'll let down
  the bars, Mr. Fox, I'll hit the trail. And if I find out anything, I'll let
  you know at once."</p>

  <p>When she rode over the bleak upland she caught herself wishing that she
  might talk the thing over with Ward. He would know just what ought to be
  done. But winter was coming, and she would drive her stock down into the
  fields she had ready. They would be safe there, surely. Still, she wished
  Ward would come. She wanted to talk it over with a man who understood and who
  knew more about such things than she did.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; WARD HUNTS WOLVES</h2>

  <p class="first">THE fate of the four heifer calves became permanently
  wrapped in the blank fog of mystery. Billy Louise watched for them when she
  rode out in the hills, and spent a good deal of time heretofore given over to
  dreaming in trying to solve the riddle of their disappearance. Charlie Fox
  insisted upon keeping to the theory that they had merely strayed. Marthy
  grumbled sometimes over the loss, and Ward&mdash;well, Ward did not put in an
  appearance again that fall or winter and so did not hear of the incident.</p>

  <p>November brought a long, tiresome storm of snow and sleet and chill winds,
  which even the beasts would not face, except when they were forced. After
  that there were days of chilly sunlight, nights of black frost, and more wind
  and rain and snow. Each little ranch oasis withdrew into itself and settled
  down to pass the winter in physical comfort and mental isolation. Even Billy
  Louise seldom rode abroad unless she was compelled to, which was not often.
  The stage which passed through the Wolverine basin twice a week left scanty
  mail in the starch-box which Billy Louise had herself nailed to a post
  nearest the trail. Now and then a chance traveler pulled thankfully out of
  the trail, stopped for a warm dinner or a bed, and afterwards went his way.
  But from October until the hills were green, there was never a sight of Ward,
  and Billy Louise changed her mood and her opinion of him three or four times
  a week.</p>

  <p>Ward, as a matter of fact, had a very good reason for his absence. He was
  working for a rancher over on the other side of the mountains, and when he
  got leave of absence, it was merely that he might ride to his claim and sleep
  there a night in compliance with the law, and see that nothing was disturbed.
  He was earning forty dollars a month, which he could not afford to jeopardize
  by any prolonged absence; and he was to take part of his pay in cows. Also,
  he had made arrangements to keep his few head of stock with the rancher's for
  a nominal sum, which barely saved Ward from the humiliation of feeling that
  the man was giving him something for nothing. Junkins, the rancher, was a
  good fellow, and he had a fair sense of values. He knew that he could pay
  Ward these wages and let him winter his stock there&mdash;I believe Ward had
  seven or eight head at that time&mdash;and still make a fair profit on his
  labor. For Ward stuck to his work, and he worked fast, with the drive of his
  nervous energy and the impatience he always felt toward any obstacle. Junkins
  considered privately that Ward was giving him the work of two men, while he
  had the appetite of one. So that it was to his interest to induce Ward to
  stay until spring opened and gave him plenty to do on his own claim; and such
  was Ward's anxiety to acquire some property and a certain financial security,
  that he put behind him the temptation to ride down to the Wolverine until he
  was once more his own master. He had sold his time to Junkins. He would not
  pilfer the hours it would take to ride twenty miles and back again, even to
  see Billy Louise; which proves that he was no moral weakling, whatever else
  he might be.</p>

  <p>Then, in April, he left Junkins and drove home a nice little bunch of ten
  cows and a two-year-old and two yearlings. One of the cows had a week-old
  calf, and there would be more before long. Ward sang the whole of <i>Chisholm
  Trail</i> at the top of his voice, as he drifted the cattle slowly up the
  long hill to the top of the divide, from where he could look down over lower
  hills into his own little creek-bottom.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"With my knees in the saddle and my seat in the sky,<br>
  I'll quit punching cows in the sweet by-and-by,"</p><br>

  <p class="first">he finished exuberantly and promised himself that he would
  ride down to the Wolverine the very next day "and see how the folks came
  through the winter." He wanted to tell William Louisa that he was some cowman
  himself, these days. He thought he had made a pretty good showing in the last
  twelve months; for when he first met her, at the Cedar Creek ford, he hadn't
  owned a hoof except the four which belonged to Rattler, his horse. He thought
  that maybe, if the play came right and he didn't lose his nerve, he might
  tell William Louisa something else! It seemed to him that he had earned the
  right now.</p>

  <p>He rode three miles oblivious to his surroundings, while he went carefully
  over his acquaintance&mdash;no, his friendship&mdash;with Billy Louise and
  tried to guess what she would say when he told her what he had wanted to tell
  her for a year; what he had been hungry to tell her. Sometimes he smiled a
  little, and sometimes he looked gloomy. He ended by hurrying the cattle down
  the canyon so that he might ride on to the Wolverine that night. It would be
  tough on Rattler, but then, what's a range cayuse made for, anyway? Rattler
  had had a snap, all winter; he could stand a hard deal once, for a change. It
  would do the old skate good to lift himself over fifty miles once more.</p>

  <p>Whether it did Rattler any good or not, it put new heart into Ward to ride
  down the bluff and see the wink of the cabin window once more. He smiled
  suddenly to himself, threw back his shoulders, and lifted up his voice in the
  doggerel that had come to be a sort of bond between the two.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"I'm on my best horse and a-comin' on the run,<br>
  Best blamed cowboy that ever pulled a gun,"</p><br>

  <p class="first">he shouted gleefully. A yellow square opened in the cabin's
  side, and a figure stood outlined against the shining background. Ward
  laughed happily.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Coma ti yi youpy, youpy-a, youpy-a,"</p>

  <p class="first">he sang uproariously.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise turned her head toward the interior of the cabin and then
  left the light and merged into the darkness without. Ward risked a broken
  neck and went down the last bit of slope as if he were trying to head a
  steer. By the time he galloped up to the gate, Billy Louise was leaning over
  it. He could see her form dimly there.</p>

  <p>"'Lo, Bill," he said softly and slid out of the saddle and went up to her.
  "How you was, already?" Again his voice was like a kiss.</p>

  <p>"'Lo, Ward!" (in a tone that returned the kiss). "Don't know whether the
  stopping's good to-night or not. We've quit taking in tramps. Where the
  dickens have you been for the last ten years?" And that, on top of a firm
  conviction in Billy's Louise's mind that she did not care whether Ward ever
  crossed her trail again, and that when he did, he would have to do a lot of
  explaining before she would thaw to anything approaching friendliness. Oh,
  well, we all change our minds sometimes.</p>

  <p>"I felt like it was twenty," Ward affirmed. "Do I get any supper, William?
  I like to have ridden my horse to a standstill getting here to-night; know
  that? I hope you appreciate the fact."</p>

  <p>"It's a wonder you wouldn't have started a little sooner, then," Billy
  Louise retorted. "Along about Christmas, for instance."</p>

  <p>"Wasn't my fault I didn't, William. Think I've got nothing to do but chase
  around the country calling on young ladies? I've been a wage slave, Bill-Loo.
  Come on while I put up my horse. Poor devil, I drove cattle from Junkins'
  place with him, and they weren't what you could call trail-broke, either. And
  then I came on down here. I've been in the saddle since daylight, young lady;
  and Rattler's been under it."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm very sure that it is not my fault," Billy Louise disclaimed, as
  she walked beside him to the stable.</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure of that! I might produce some pretty strong evidence that
  the last twenty miles is your fault. Say, you didn't know I've gone into the
  cow business myself, did you, William? I've been working like one
  son-of-a-gun all fall and winter, and I'm in the cattle-king class&mdash;to
  the extent of twelve head. I knew you were crazy to hear the glad tidings, so
  I tried to kill off a horse to get here and tell you. You and me'll be
  running a wagon and full crew in another year, don't you reckon? And send
  reps over into Wyoming and around, to look after our interests!" He laughed
  at himself with a perfect understanding of his own insignificance as a
  cattle-owner, and Billy Louise laughed with him, though not at him, for it
  seemed to her that Ward had done well, considering his small
  opportunities.</p>

  <p>To be sure, in these days when civilization travels by million-dollar
  milestones, and the hero of a ten-dollar story scorns any enterprise which
  requires less than five figures to name its profits, Ward and Billy Louise
  and Charlie Fox&mdash;and all their neighbors&mdash;do not amount to much.
  But it is a fact that real men and women in the real world beyond the horizon
  work hard and fight real battles for a very small success compared with Big
  Interests and the modern storyman. And I'm telling you of some real people in
  a real world out in the sagebrush country, where not even a story hero may
  consistently become a millionaire in ten chapters. There is no millionaire
  material in the sagebrush country, you know, unless it is planted there by
  the Big Interests; and the Big Interests do not plant in barren soil. So if
  twelve head of cattle look too trifling to mention, I can't help it. Ward
  worked mighty hard for those few animals, and saved and schemed, and denied
  himself much pleasure. Therefore, he did as well as any man under the
  circumstances could do and be honest.</p>

  <p>He did not do so very well when it came to telling Billy Louise something.
  Twice during his visit he had to admit to himself that the play came right to
  tell her. And both times Ward shied like a horse in the moonlight. For all
  that he sang about half the way home, the next day, and for the rest of the
  way he built castles; which proves that his visit had not been
  disappointing.</p>

  <p>He rode out into the pasture where his cattle were grazing and sat looking
  at them while he smoked a cigarette. And while he smoked, that small herd
  grew and multiplied before the eyes of his imagination, until he needed a
  full crew of riders to take care of them. He shipped a trainload of beef to
  Chicago before he threw away the cigarette stub, and he laughed to himself
  when he rode back to the log cabin in the grove of quaking aspens.</p>

  <p>"I'm getting my money's worth out of that bunch, just in the fun of
  planning ahead," he realized, while he whittled shavings from the edge of a
  cracker-box to start his supper fire. "A few cows and calves make the best
  day-dream material I've struck yet; wish I had more of the same. I'd make old
  Dame Fortune put a different brand on me, pronto. She could spell it with an
  F, but it wouldn't be football. If the cards fall right," he mused, when the
  fire was hot and crackling, and he was slicing bacon with his pocket-knife,
  "I'll get the best of her yet. And&mdash;" His coffee-pail boiled over and
  interrupted him. He burned his fingers before he slid the pail to a cooler
  spot, and after that he thought of the joys of having a certain gray-eyed
  girl for his housekeeper, and for a time he forgot about his newly acquired
  herd.</p>

  <p>And then his day-dreams received a severer jolt, and one more lasting. He
  began to realize something that he had always known: that there is something
  more to the cattle business than branding the calves and selling the
  beef.</p>

  <p>When the first calf went to dull the hunger of the wolves that howled
  o'nights among the rocks and stunted pines on Bannock Butte, Ward swore a
  good deal and resolved to ride with his rifle tied on the saddle hereafter.
  Also, he went back immediately, got a little fat, blue bottle of strychnine,
  and returned and "salted" the small remnant of the carcass. It was no part of
  his dreams to have the profit chewed off his little herd by wolves.</p>

  <p>When the second calf was pulled down in spite of the mother's defense,
  within half a mile of his cabin, Ward postponed a trip he had meant to make
  to the Wolverine and went out on the trail of the wolves. In the loose soil
  of the lower ridge he tracked them easily and rode at a shuffling trot along
  the cow-trail they had followed, his eyes keen for some further sign of them.
  He guessed that there would be at least one den farther up in the gulch that
  opened out ahead, and if he could find it and get the pups&mdash;well, the
  bounty on one litter would even his loss, even if he were not lucky enough to
  get one of the old ones. He had a shovel tied to the saddle under his left
  leg, to use in case he found a den.</p>

  <p>So, planning a crusade against these enemies to his enterprise, he picked
  his way slowly up the side of the deep gully that had a little stream
  wandering through rocks at the bottom. His eyes, that Billy Louise had found
  so quick and keen, noted every little jutting shelf of rock, every badger
  hole, every bush. It looked like a good place for dens of wolf or coyote. And
  with the sun shining down warm on his shoulders, and the meadow larks singing
  from swaying weeds, and rabbits scuttling away through the rocks now and
  then, Ward began to forget the ill-luck that had brought him out and to enjoy
  the hunt for its own sake.</p>

  <p>Farther along there were so many places that would bear investigation that
  he left Rattler on a level spot, and with his rifle and six-shooter, went
  forward on foot, climbing over ledges of rock, forcing his way through
  green-budded, wild-rose bushes or sliding down loose, gravelly slopes.</p>

  <p>One place&mdash;a tiny cave under a huge bowlder&mdash;looked promising.
  There were wolf tracks going in and out, plenty of them. But there were no
  bones or offal anywhere around, and Ward decided that it was not a family
  residence, but that the wolves had perhaps invaded the nest of some other
  animal. He went on hopefully. That side of the gulch was cobwebbed with
  tracks.</p>

  <p>Then, quite accidentally, he glanced across to the far side, his eyes
  attracted to something which had moved. He could see nothing at first, though
  from the corner of his eye he had certainly caught a flicker of movement over
  there. Yellow sand, gray rocks and bushes, and above a curlew circling, with
  long beak outstretched before, and long, red legs stretched out behind. He
  almost believed he had but caught the swift passing of a cloud shadow over
  there and was on the point of climbing farther up his own slope, to where a
  yawning hole in the hill showed signs of being pawed and trampled. Then an
  outline slowly defined itself among a jumble of rocks; head, sloping back,
  two points for ears. It might be a rock, but it began to look more and more
  like a wolf sitting up on its haunches watching him fixedly.</p>

  <p>Even while Ward lifted his rifle and got the ivory bead snugly fitted into
  the notch of the rear sight with his eye, he would not have bet two-bits that
  he was aiming at an animal. He pulled the trigger with a steady crooking of
  his forefinger and the whole gulch clamored with the noise. The object over
  there leaped high, came down heavily, and rolled ten feet down the hill to
  another level, where it bounded three or four times convulsively, slid a few
  feet farther, and lay still behind a bush.</p>

  <p>"Got you that time, you old Turk, if you did nearly fool me playing you
  were part of the scenery." Ward slid recklessly down to the bottom, sought a
  narrow place, jumped the creek, and climbed exultantly to where the wolf lay
  twisted on its back, its eyes half open and glazed, its jaws parted in a
  sardonic grin. Ward grinned also as he looked at it. He gave the carcass a
  poke with his boot-toe and glanced up the hill toward the rocks.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you were playing lookout for the bunch," he said, "and then again,
  maybe you ain't hooked up with a family; though from the looks, you ain't
  weaned your pups yet&mdash;till just now." Leaving the wolf where she lay, he
  climbed to the rocks where he had first seen her. They lay high piled, but he
  could see daylight through every open space and so knew there was no den. The
  base rested solidly on the yellow earth.</p>

  <p>Ward stood and looked at the slope below. To the right and half-way down
  was a ten-foot ledge, and below that outcropped a steep bank of earth. He
  could not see what lay immediately below, but while he was still staring, a
  pointed, gray nose topped by pert, gray ears poked cautiously over the bank,
  hovered there sniffing, and dropped back out of sight.</p>

  <p>"You little son-of-a-gun!" he exclaimed and dug in his heels on the sharp
  descent. "I've got you right where I want you, now."</p>

  <p>The den was tunneled into the earth just over another ledge, which
  underlay the bank there, and gave a sheer drop of ten or fifteen feet to the
  slope below, where a thick fringe of blossoming cherry bushes grew close and
  hid the ledge so completely that the den had been perfectly concealed from
  across the gulch. It was a case where the shovel was needed. Ward "flagged"
  the den by throwing his coat down before the opening and went back to where
  Rattler waited. He was jubilant over his good luck. With an average litter of
  pups, and the old wolf besides, the bounty would make those two calves the
  most profitable animals in the bunch, reckoned on the basis of money invested
  in them.</p>

  <p>With the shovel he enlarged the tunnel, and between strokes he heard the
  whimpering of the pups. The sound sobered his face to a pitying
  determination. Poor little devils, it was not their fault that they were born
  to be a menace rather than a help to mankind. He was sorry for their terror,
  while he dug back to where they huddled against the farthest wall of their
  nest. He worked fast that he might the sooner end their discomfort, and his
  forehead was puckered into a frown at the harsh law of life that it must
  preserve its existence at the expense of some other life. Yet he dug back and
  back, burrowing into the bank toward the whimpering. It was farther than he
  had thought, but the soil was a loose sand and gravel, and he made good
  headway.</p>

  <p>Then, laying down his shovel, he reached into a hysterical squirm of soft
  hair and sharp little teeth that snapped at his gloved hand. One by one he
  hauled them out, whining, biting, struggling like the little savages they
  were. One by one he sent them into oblivion with a sharp tap of the shovel.
  There were eight, just big enough to make little, investigative trips outside
  the den when all was quiet. Ward was glad he had found them and wiped them
  out of existence, but it had not been pleasant work.</p>

  <p>He wiped the perspiration off his face with his handkerchief, pushed his
  hat to the back of his head, and sat down on the ledge beside the pile of
  dirt he had thrown out. He felt the need of a smoke, after all that
  exertion.</p>

  <p>It was while he was smoking and resting that he first became conscious of
  the pile of dirt as something more than the obstacle between himself and the
  wolf-pups. He blew a little cloud of smoke from his mouth, leaned and lifted
  a handful of sand, picked something out of it, and looked at it intently. He
  said "Humph!" skeptically. Then he turned his head and stared at the ledge
  above and to the right of him, twisted half around and scanned the steep
  slope immediately above the earth bank, and then looked at the gulch beneath
  him. He took his cigarette from his lips, said, "Well, I'll be darned!" and
  put it back again. With his forefinger he turned over a small, rusty lump the
  size of a pea, wiped it upon his sleeve, and bent over it eagerly, holding it
  so that the light struck it revealingly. His face glowed. Save the want of
  tenderness in his eyes, he looked as though Billy Louise stood before him;
  the same guarded gladness, the same intent eagerness.</p>

  <p>Ward sprawled over that pile of gravel and sand and searched with his
  fingers, as young girls search a thick bank of clover for the magic four
  leaves. He found one other small lump that he kept, but beyond that his
  search was barren of result. Still, that glow remained in his face. Finally
  he roused himself as though he realized that he was behaving foolishly. He
  made himself another cigarette and smoked it fast, keeping pace with his
  shuttling thoughts. And by the time the paper tube was burned down to an
  inch-long stub, he had won back his manner of imperturbable calm; only his
  eyes betrayed a hidden excitement.</p>

  <p>"Looks like there's money in wolves," he said aloud and laughed a little.
  "Old Lady Fortune, you want to watch out, or I'm liable to get the best of
  you yet! Looks like I've got a hand to draw to, now. Youp-<i>ee-ee</i>!" His
  forced imperturbability exploded in the yell, and after that he moved
  briskly.</p>

  <p>"I've got to play safe on this," he warned himself, while he scalped the
  last of the pups. "No use getting rattled. If she's good as she looks, she's
  fine. She'll help boost my little bunch of cattle, and that's all I want. I
  ain't going to go hog-wild over it, like so many do."</p>

  <p>He went over and skinned the mother wolf, and with the pelts in a
  strong-smelling bundle, returned to the sand pile and filled his neckerchief
  as full as he could tie it. Then he went down into the gulch, jumped the
  creek with his load&mdash;and got a foot wet where his boot leaked along the
  sole&mdash;and climbed hurriedly up to where Rattler waited and dozed in the
  sunshine, with the reins dropped to the ground.</p>

  <p>Rattler objected to those fresh wolf-skins, and Ward lifted a disciplinary
  boot-toe to his ribs. His mood did not accept patiently any unnecessary delay
  in getting home, and he succeeded in making Rattler aware of his mood.
  Rattler laid back his ears and took the trail in long, rabbit-jumps for
  spite, risking his own and his master's bones unchecked and unchided. The
  pace pleased Ward, and to the risk he gave no thought. He was reconstructing
  his air-castles on broader lines and smiling now and then to himself.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; HELP FOR THE COW BUSINESS</h2>

  <p class="first">HE had no goldpan of his own, since this was not a mining
  country, and his ambition had run in a different channel. He, therefore, took
  the tin washbasin down to the creek and dumped the sand into it. Then,
  squatting on his boot-heels at the edge of the stream, he filled the basin
  with water and rocked it gently with a rotary motion that proved him no
  novice at the work. His eyes were sharper and more intent in their gaze than
  Billy Louise had ever seen them, and, though his movements were unhurried,
  they were full of eagerness held in leash.</p>

  <p>Several times he refilled the basin, and the amount of sand grew less and
  less, until there remained only a few spoonfuls of coarse gravel and a
  sediment that clung to the bottom of the basin and moved sluggishly around
  and around. He picked out the tiny pebbles one by one and threw them in the
  creek. He peered sharply at a small bit and held it in his fingers, while he
  bent his face close to the pan, his eyes two gimlets boring into the
  contents.</p>

  <p>He got up stiffly, backed, and sat down upon the low bank with his feet
  far apart and his shoulders bent, while he stared at the little bit of
  mineral in his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Coarse gold, and not such a hell of a lot," he pronounced to himself with
  careful impartiality. "But it's pay dirt, and if there's enough of it, it'll
  help a lot at this end of the cow business." He sat there a long time,
  thinking and planning and holding himself sternly to cold reality, rejecting
  every possibility that had the slightest symptom of being an air-castle. He
  did not intend to let this thing turn his head or betray him into any
  foolishness whatsoever. He was going to look at the thing cold-bloodedly and
  put his imagination in cold storage for the present.</p>

  <p>His first impulse&mdash;to ride straight to the Wolverine and show Billy
  Louise these three tiny nuggets&mdash;he rejected as a bit of foolishness. He
  was perfectly willing to trust Billy Louise with any secret he possessed, but
  he knew that he would be feeding her imagination with dangerous fuel. She
  would begin dreaming and building castles and prospecting for herself, very
  likely; and that trail led oftenest to black disappointment. If he made good,
  he would tell her&mdash;when he told her something else. And if the whole
  thing were just a fluke, a stray deposit of a little gold that did not amount
  to anything, then it would be best for her to know nothing about it. Ward
  felt in himself, at that moment, the keen foretaste of bitter disappointment
  which would follow such a certainty. He did not want Billy Louise exposed to
  that pain.</p>

  <p>He would tell her about the wolves, of course. It was pretty hard not to
  tell her everything that concerned himself, but the streak of native
  reticence in his nature had been strengthened by the vicissitudes of the life
  he had lived. While Billy Louise had found the sole weak point which made
  that reticence scarcely a barrier to full confidence, still he knew that he
  would keep this from her if he made up his mind to it.</p>

  <p>He would not tell anybody. He raised his head and looked at the hills
  where his cattle would feed, and pictured it cluttered with gold-hunters,
  greedy, undesirable interlopers doomed to disappointment in the long run.
  Ward had seen the gold fever sweep through a community and spoil life for the
  weak ones who took to chasing the will-o'-the-wisp of sudden wealth. Tramps
  of the pick-and-pan brigade&mdash;they should not come swarming into these
  hills on any wild-goose chase, if he could help it. And he could and should.
  This was not, properly speaking, a gold country. He knew it. The rock
  formations did not point to any great deposit of the mineral, and if he had
  found one, it was a fluke, an accident. He resolved that his first
  consideration should be the keeping of his secret for the mental well-being
  of his fellows.</p>

  <p>Ward did not put it quite so altruistically. His thoughts formed into
  sentences.</p>

  <p>"This is cattle country. If men want to hunt gold, they can do their
  hunting somewhere else. They can't go digging up the whole blamed country
  just on the chance of finding another pocket like this one. I'm in the cattle
  business myself. If I find any gold, it'll go into cattle and stay there; and
  there won't be any long-haired freaks pestering around here if I can help it,
  and I reckon maybe I can, all right.</p>

  <p>"I'd sure like to talk it over with Billy, but what she don't know won't
  worry her; and I don't know yet what I've gone up against. Maybe old Dame
  Fortune's just played another joke on me&mdash;played me for a fool again.
  I'll take a chance, but I won't give that little girl down below there
  anything to spoil her sleep."</p>

  <p>Ward's memory was like glue, and while it held things he would give much
  to forget, still it served him well. He had ridden past a tiny, partly
  caved-in dugout, months ago, where some wandering prospector had camped while
  he braved the barrenness of the bills and streams hereabout. Ward had
  dismounted and glanced into the cavelike hut. Now, after he had eaten a few
  mouthfuls of dinner, he rode straight over to that dugout and got the goldpan
  he remembered to have seen there. It was not in the best condition, of
  course. It was battered and bent, but it would do for the present.</p>

  <p>By the time he reached the wolf den, the sun was nearing the western rim
  of hills, but Ward had time to examine the locality more carefully than he
  had done at first and to wash a couple of pans of gravel. The test elated him
  perceptibly; for while there did not seem to be the makings of a millionaire
  in that gravel bank, he judged roughly that he could make a plumber's wages
  if he worked hard enough&mdash;and that looked pretty good to a fellow who
  had worked all his life for forty dollars a month. "Two-bits a pan, just
  about," he put it to himself. "And I'll have to pack the dirt down here to
  the creek; but I'll dig a nice little bunch of cattle out of that gravel bank
  before snow flies, or I miss my guess a mile."</p>

  <p>As nearly as he could figure, he had chanced upon a split channel. For
  ages, he judged, the water had run upon that ledge, leaving the streak of
  gravel and what little gold it had carried down from the mountains. Then some
  freshet had worn over the edge of the break in the rock until the ledge and
  its deposit was left high and dry on the side of the gulch, while the creek
  flowed through the gully it had formed below. It might not be the correct
  explanation, but it satisfied Ward and encouraged him to believe that the
  streak of pay gravel lay along the ledge within easy reach.</p>

  <p>He tried to trace the ledge up and down the gulch and to estimate the
  probable extent of that pay streak. Then he gave it up in self-defense. "I've
  got to watch my dodgers," he admonished himself, "or I'll go plumb loco and
  imagine I'm a millionaire. I'll pan what I can get at and let it go at that.
  And I've got to count what gold shows up in the sack&mdash;and no more. Good
  Lord! I can't afford to make a fool of myself at this stage of the game! I've
  got to sit right down on my imagination and stick to hard-boiled facts."</p>

  <p>He went home in a very good humor with himself and the world, for all
  that. So far as he could see, the thing that had been bothering him was
  settled most satisfactorily. He had wanted to spend the summer on his claim,
  making improvements and watching over his cattle. There was fence to build
  and some hay to cut; and he would like to build another room on to the cabin.
  Ward had certain fastidious instincts, and he rebelled inwardly at eating,
  sleeping, and cooking all in one small room. But he had not been able to
  solve the problem of earning a living while he did all this&mdash;to say
  nothing of buying supplies. And he really needed a team and tools, if he
  meant to put up any hay.</p>

  <p>Now, with that pay gravel within reach, and the gold running twenty-five
  cents to the pan, and the occasional tiny nuggets jumping up the yield now
  and then, he could go ahead and do the things he wanted to do. And he could
  dream about having a certain gray-eyed girl for his wife, without calling
  himself names afterward.</p>

  <p>So he set to work the next morning in dead earnest with pick, shovel, and
  pan, to make the most of his little find. He shoveled the dirt and gravel
  into a gunny sack, threw the sack as far as he could over the ledge at the
  end, where it was not hidden and cluttered with the cherry-trees and service
  berries below, and when it stopped rolling, he carried it the rest of the
  way. Then he panned it in the little creek, watching like a hawk for nuggets
  and the finer gold. It was back-breaking work, and he felt that he earned
  every cent he got. But the cents were there, in good gold, and he was
  perfectly willing to work for what he received in this world.</p>

  <p>After a couple of weeks he stopped long enough to make a hurried trip to
  Hardup, a little town forty miles farther up in the hills. In the little bank
  there he exchanged his gold harvest for coin of the realm, and he was well
  satisfied with the result. It was not a fortune, nor was he likely to find
  one in the hills. But he bought a team, wagon, and harness with the money,
  and he had enough left over for a two-months' grubstake and plenty of Durham
  and papers and a few magazines. That left him just enough silver to pay
  Rattler's bill at the livery stable. Nothing startling, but still not
  bad&mdash;that wolf-den find.</p>

  <p>He had a lot of trouble getting his wagon to his claim, but by judicious
  driving and the liberal use of a log-chain for a rough lock, he managed to
  land the whole outfit in the little flat before the cabin without any mishap.
  After that he settled down to work the thing systematically.</p>

  <p>One day he would pan the sandy gravel, and the next day he would rest his
  back digging post-holes or something comparatively easy. He worked from
  daybreak until it was too dark to see, and he never left his claim except
  when he went to wash gold up in the gulch. The world moved on, and he neither
  knew nor cared how it moved; for the time being his world had narrowed
  amazingly. If Billy Louise had not been down there in that other world, he
  would scarcely have given it a thought, so absorbed was he in the delightful
  task of putting a good, solid foundation under his favorite air-castle. That
  fascinated him, held him to his work in spite of his hunger to see her and
  talk with her and watch the changing lights in her eyes and the fleeting
  expressions of her face.</p>

  <p>Some day he hoped he would have her with him always. He put it stronger
  than that: Some day he would have her with him, there in that little valley
  he had chosen; riding with him over those hills that smiled and seemed to
  stand there waiting for their invasions, with the echoes ready to fling back
  his exultant voice when he called to her or sang for her or laughed at her;
  ready to imitate enviously her voice when she laughed back at him. He wanted
  that day to come soon, and so with days and hours and minutes he became a
  miser and would not spend them in the luxury of a visit to her. It seemed to
  him that his longing for her measured itself by the enormous appetite he had
  for work, that summer.</p>

  <p>Week followed week as he followed that thin, fluctuating streak of pay
  gravel along the ledge. Sometimes it was rich enough to set the pulse
  pounding in his temples; sometimes it was so poor that he was disgusted to
  the point of abandoning the work. But every day he worked, it yielded him
  something&mdash;though there was a week when he averaged about fifty cents a
  day and lived with a scowl on his face&mdash;and he kept at it.</p>

  <p>He went out in June and bought a mower and rake and then spent precious
  days getting them into his valley. There was no road, you see, and he was
  compelled to haul them in a wagon, through country where nature never meant
  four wheels to pass. He hired a man for a month&mdash;one of those migratory
  individuals who works for a week or a month in one place and then wanders on
  till his money is spent&mdash;and he drove that man as relentlessly as he
  drove himself. Together they accomplished much, while the goldpan lay hidden
  under a buck brush and Ward's waking moments were filled with an uneasy sense
  of wasted time. Still, it was for the good of his ranch and his cattle and
  his air-castle that he toiled in the gulch, and it was necessary that he
  should put up what hay he could. There would be calves to feed next winter,
  he hoped; and when the hardest storms came, his horse would need a little.
  The rest of the stock would have to rustle; and that was why he had chosen
  this nook among the hills, where the wind would sweep the high slopes bare of
  snow, and the gulches would give shelter with their heavy thickets of quaking
  aspens and willow and alder.</p>

  <p>He was thankful when the creek bottom was shaved clean of grass, and the
  stack beside his corral was of a satisfying length and height. The summer had
  been kind to the grass-growth, and his hay crop was larger than he had
  expected. A few days had remained of the month, and Ward had used them to
  extend his fence so as to give more pasturage to his calves in mild weather.
  After that he paid the man, directed him to the nearest point on the stage
  road, and breathed thanks that he was alone again, and could go back to his
  plan of digging a nice little hunch of cattle out of that bank before snow
  flew.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; WHEN EMOTIONS ARE BOTTLED</h2>

  <p class="first">ONE day, when the sun was warm and the breeze that filtered
  down the gorge was pleasantly cool, Ward straightened his aching back, waded
  out to dry ground, and sat down to rest a few minutes and make a smoke. His
  interest in the work had oozed steadily since sunrise, and left nothing but
  the back-breaking toil. He had found a nugget the size of a hazelnut in the
  second pan that morning, so it was not discouragement that had made his
  monotonous movements grow slow and reluctant. Until he had smoked half the
  cigarette, he himself did not know what it was that ailed him. Then he flung
  up his head quite suddenly and gave a snort of understanding.</p>

  <p>"Hang the gold! I'm going visiting for a change."</p>

  <p>He concealed the goldpan and his pick, shovel, and sacks in the clump of
  service berries and chokeberries that grew at the foot of the ledge and hid
  from view the bank where he dug out his pay dirt. That did not take more than
  two or three minutes, and he made them up after he had swung into the saddle
  on the farther hillside. It was not a good trail, and except for his first
  exultant ride home that way, he had ridden it at a walk. Now he made Rattler
  trot where loping was too risky; and so he came clattering down the steep
  trail into the little flat beside his cabin. He would have something to eat,
  and feed Rattler a little hay, and then ride on to the Wolverine. And now
  that he had yielded to his hunger to see the one person in the world for whom
  he felt any tenderness, he grudged every minute that separated him from her.
  He loosened the cinch with one or two yanks and left the saddle on Rattler,
  to save time. He turned him loose in the hay corral with the bridle off,
  rather than spend the extra minutes it would take to put him in a stall and
  carry him a forkful of hay. He thought he would not bother to start a fire
  and boil coffee; he would eat the sour-dough bread and fried rabbit hams he
  had taken with him for lunch, and he would start down the creek in half an
  hour. He imagined himself an extremely sensible young man and considerate of
  his horse's comfort, to give him thirty precious minutes in which to eat hay.
  It was not absolutely necessary; Rattler could travel forty miles instead of
  twenty without another mouthful, so far as that was concerned. Ward was
  simply behaving in a perfectly normal manner and was not letting his feelings
  get the better of him in the slightest degree. As to his impromptu vacation,
  he was certainly entitled to it; he ought to have taken one long ago, he told
  himself virtuously. He had panned dirt all day, the Fourth of July; that was
  last week, he believed. And he had not made more than two dollars, either.
  No, he was not behaving foolishly at all. He had himself well in hand.</p>

  <p>Then he flung open the door of his cabin and went white with sheer
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"'Lo, Ward!" Billy Louise had been standing behind the door, and she
  jumped out at him, laughing, just as if she were ten years old instead of
  nearly twenty.</p>

  <p>Ward tried to say, "'Lo, Bill," in return, but the words would not come.
  His lips trembled too much, and his voice was pinched out in his throat. His
  mind refused to tell him what he ought to do; but his arms did not wait upon
  his paralyzed mental processes. They shot out of their own accord, caught
  Billy Louise, and brought her close against his pounding heart. Ward was
  startled and a little shocked at what he had done, but he held her closer and
  closer, until Billy Louise was gasping from something more than surprise.</p>

  <p>Next, Ward's lips joined the mutiny against his reason, and laid
  themselves upon the parted, panting lips of Billy Louise, as though that was
  where they belonged.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise had probably not expected anything like that, though of a
  truth one can never safely guess at what is in the mind of a girl. She tried
  to pull herself free, and when she could make no impression upon the grip of
  those arms&mdash;they had been growing muscles of iron manipulating that
  goldpan, remember!&mdash;she very sensibly yielded to necessity and stood
  still.</p>

  <p>"Stop, Ward! You&mdash;I&mdash;you haven't any right to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, give me the right, then." Ward managed to find voice enough to make
  the demand, and then he kissed her many times before he attempted to say
  another word. Lord, but he had been hungry for her, these last three months!
  "You'll give me the right, won't you, Wilhemina?" he murmured against her
  ear, brushing a lock of hair away with his lips. "You know you belong to me,
  don't you? And I belong to you&mdash;body and soul. You know that, don't you?
  I've known it ever since the world was made. I knew it when God said, 'Let
  there be light,' and there was light. You were it."</p>

  <p>"You sill-y thing." Billy Louise did not seem to know whether she wanted
  to laugh or cry. "What do you think you're talking about, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"About the way the world was made." Ward loosened his clasp a little and
  looked down deep into her eyes. "My world, I mean." He bent and kissed her
  again, gravely and very, very tenderly. "Oh, Wilhemina, you know&mdash;" he
  waited, gazing down with that intent look which had a new softness behind
  it&mdash;"you know there's nothing in this world but you. As far as I'm
  concerned, there isn't. There never will be."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise reached up her hands to his shoulders and tried to give him a
  shake. "Is that why you've stuck yourself in these hills for three whole
  months and never come near? You fibber!"</p>

  <p>"That's why, lady-girl. I've been sticking here, working like one
  son-of-a-gun&mdash;for you. So I could have you sooner." He lifted his bent
  head and looked around the little cabin like a man who has just wakened to
  his surroundings. "I knocked off work a little while ago, and I was going to
  see you. I couldn't stand it any longer. And&mdash;here you iss!" he went on,
  giving her shoulders a little squeeze. "A straight case of 'two souls with
  but a single thought,' don't you reckon?"</p>

  <p>Billy Louise, by a visible effort, brought the situation down to earth.
  She twisted herself free and went over to the stove and saved a frying-pan of
  potatoes from burning to a crisp.</p>

  <p>"I don't know about your soul," she said, glancing back at him. "I happen
  to have two or three thoughts in mine. One is that I'm half starved. The
  second is that you're not acting a bit nice, under the circumstances; no
  perfectly polite young man makes love to a girl when she is supposedly
  helpless and under his protection." She stopped there to wrinkle her nose at
  him and twist her mouth humorously. "The third thought is that if you don't
  behave, I shall go straight home and never be nice to you again. And," she
  added, getting back of the coffee-pot&mdash;which looked new&mdash;"the rest
  of my soul is one great big blob of question-marks. If you can eat and talk
  at the same time, you may tell me what this frantic industry is all about. If
  you can't, I'll have to wait till after dinner; not even my curiosity is
  going to punish my poor tummy any longer." She pulled a pan of biscuits from
  the oven, lifted them out one at a time with dainty little nabs because they
  were hot, and stole a glance now and then at Ward from under her
  eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Ward stood and looked at her until the food was all on the table. He was
  breathing unnaturally, and his jaws were set hard together. When she pushed a
  box up to the table and sat down upon it, and rested her elbows on the
  oilcloth and looked straight at him with her chin nested in her two palms, he
  drew a long breath, hunched his shoulders with some mental surrender, and
  grinned wryly.</p>

  <p>"So be it," he yielded, throwing his hat upon the bunk. "I kinda
  overplayed my hand, anyway. I most humbly ask your pardon!" He bowed
  farcically and took up the wash-basin from its bench just outside the
  door.</p>

  <p>"You see, William Louisa," he went on quizzically, when he had seated
  himself opposite her and was helping himself to the potatoes, "when a young
  lady invades strange territory, and hides behind strange doors, and jumps out
  at an unsuspecting but terribly well-meaning young man, she's apt to get a
  surprise. When emotions are bottled&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind the bottled emotions. I'd like some potatoes, if you don't
  want them all. I see you haven't the faintest idea how to treat a guest.
  Charlie Fox would have died before he would help himself and set down the
  dish away out of my reach. You could stick pins into him till he howled, but
  you couldn't make him be rude to a lady."</p>

  <p>"I'd sure like to," muttered Ward ambiguously and handed her every bit of
  food within his reach.</p>

  <p>"You can talk and eat at the same time, I see. So tell me what you've been
  doing all this while." Billy Louise spoke lightly, even flippantly, but her
  eyes were making love to him shyly, whether she knew it or not.</p>

  <p>"Working," answered Ward promptly and briefly. He was thinking at the rate
  of a million thoughts a minute, it seemed to him, and he was afraid to let go
  of himself and say what he thought. One thing he knew beyond all doubt, and
  that was that he must be careful or he would see his air-castle blow up in
  small fragments and come down a hopeless ruin. He needed time to think, and
  Billy Louise was not giving him even a minute. So he clutched at two
  decisions which instinct told him might help him win to safety: He would not
  make love, and he would not tell Billy Louise about the gold.</p>

  <p>"Working! Well, so have I. But working at what? Did you hire out to
  Junkins again? I thought you said you wouldn't till fall." Billy Louise was
  watching Ward rather closely, perhaps to see how far she might trust his
  recovered inscrutability. "Why don't you show some human inquisitiveness
  about my being here?" she asked irrelevantly, just as Ward was hastily
  choosing how he would answer her without saying too much.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be polite to be inquisitive about a lady, would it?" Ward
  retorted, thankful for the change of subject.</p>

  <p>"N-no&mdash;but, then, you never bother about being just polite! Charlie
  Fox would&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Charlie Fox would think you came to see him," Ward asserted uncharitably.
  "My head isn't swelled to that extent. Why did you come, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"To see you." Billy Louise lost her nerve when she saw the light leap into
  his eyes. "To see whether you were dead or not," she revised hastily, "so
  mommie would stop worrying about you. Mommie has pestered the life out of me
  for the last month, thinking you might be sick or hurt or something.
  So&mdash;I was riding up this way, anyway, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I see I'll have to ride down and prove to mommie that I'm very much
  alive. I'm sure glad to know that somebody takes an interest in me&mdash;as
  if I were a real human." Ward's eyes watched furtively her face, but Billy
  Louise refused even to nibble at the bait.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you come before, then? You know mommie likes to have you."</p>

  <p>"How about mommie's child?" Ward's look was dangerous to his good
  resolutions.</p>

  <p>"Listen here, Ward." Billy Louise took refuge behind her terrible
  frankness. "If you make love, I won't like you half as well. Don't you know
  that all the time when I used to play with my pretend Ward Warren,
  he&mdash;he never made love?" A dimple tried to show itself in her cheek and
  was sent about its business with a twist of her lips. "My pretend Ward was
  lovely; he liked me to pieces, but he never came right out and said so.
  He&mdash;he skated around the subject&mdash;" Billy Louise illustrated the
  skating process by drawing her forefinger in a wide circle around her cup.
  "He made love&mdash;with his eyes&mdash;and he kissed me with
  his&mdash;voice&mdash;but he never spoiled it with words."</p>

  <p>Ward grunted a word that sounded like "damchump."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind!" Billy Louise flew to the defense of her "pretend."
  "He knew just exactly how a girl likes to be made love to. And, anyway,
  you've been doing the selfsame thing yourself, Ward Warren, till just now.
  And&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, have I?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you have. And I might have known better than to&mdash;to startle
  you. You always, eternally, do something nobody'd ever dream of your doing.
  The first time, when I threw that chip, you pulled a gun on me&mdash;" The
  voice of Billy Louise squeezed down to a wisp of a whisper. Her eyes were
  remorseful. "Oh, Ward, I didn't mean to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's all right. I've got it coming." It was as if a mask had dropped
  before Ward's features. Even his eyes looked strange and hard in that face of
  set muscles, though the thin, bitter lips and quivering nostrils showed that
  there was feeling behind it all. "I see where you're right, William. You
  needn't be afraid; I won't make love again."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise looked as though she wanted to beat something&mdash;herself,
  most likely. She stared as they stare who watch from the dock while a loved
  one slips farther and farther away on a voyage from which there may be no
  return; only Billy Louise was not one to watch and do nothing else.</p>

  <p>"Now, Ward, don't be silly." The fright in her voice was overlaid with a
  sharpened tenderness. "You know perfectly well I didn't mean that. You're
  only proving that in the human problem you're raised to&mdash; Stop looking
  darning-needles at that coffee-pot and listen here!" Billy Louise leaned over
  the table and caught at his nearest hand, which was a closed fist. With her
  own little fingers digging persistently into the tensed muscles, she pried
  the fist open. "Ward, behave yourself, or I'll go straight home!" She held
  his straightened fingers in her own and drew a sharp breath because they lay
  inert&mdash;dead things so far as any response came to her clasp; the first
  and middle fingers yellowed a little from cigarettes, the nails soft and pink
  from much immersion in water. A tale they told, if Billy Louise had been
  paying attention.</p>

  <p>"Ward, you certainly are&mdash;the limit! You know as well as I do that
  that doesn't make a particle of difference. If I had been a boy instead of a
  girl, and had bucked the world for a living, I'd probably have done worse;
  and, anyway, it doesn't matter!" Her voice rose as if she were growing
  desperate. "I&mdash;I&mdash;like you&mdash;to pieces, Ward, and I'd&mdash;I'd
  rather marry you&mdash;than anyone else. But I don't want to think about that
  for a long while. I don't want to be engaged, or&mdash;or any different than
  the way we've been. It was good to be just pals. It was like my pretend Ward.
  I&mdash;I always wanted him&mdash;to love me, but I wouldn't play that
  he&mdash;told me, Ward. Oh, don't you see?" She shut her teeth hard together,
  because if she hadn't she would have been crying in another ten seconds.</p>

  <p>"I see." Ward spoke dully, evenly, and he still stared at the coffee-pot
  with that gimlet gaze of his that made Billy Louise want to scream. "I see a
  whole lot that I'd been shutting my eyes to. Why don't you feel
  insulted&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ward Warren, if you're going to act like a&mdash;a&mdash;" I suspect that
  Billy Louise, in her desperation, was tempted to use a swear word, but she
  resisted the temptation. She got up and went around to him, hesitated while
  she looked down at his set face, drew a long breath, and blinked back some
  tears of self-reproach because of the devils of memory she had unwittingly
  turned loose to jibe at this man.</p>

  <p>"This is why," she said softly; and leaning, she pressed her lips down
  upon his bitter ones and let them lie there for a dozen heart-beats.</p>

  <p>Ward's face relaxed, and his eyes went to hers with the hungry tenderness
  she had seen so often there. He leaned his head against her and threw up an
  arm to clasp her close. He did not say a word.</p>

  <p>"After I have kissed a man," said Billy Louise, struggling back to her old
  whimsical manner, "it won't be a bit polite for him to have any doubts of my
  feelings toward him, or my belief in him, or his belief in himself." Her
  fingers tangled themselves in his hair, just where the wave was the most
  pronounced.</p>

  <p>She had drawn the poison. Now she set herself to restore a perfectly
  normal atmosphere.</p>

  <p>"He's going to be just exactly the same good pal he was before," she went
  on, speaking softly. "And he's going to bring some water so I can wash the
  dishes, and then bring Blue so I can go home, and he isn't going to say a
  single thing more about&mdash;anything that matters two whoops."</p>

  <p>Ward's clasp tightened and then grew loose. He drew a long breath and let
  her go.</p>

  <p>"You do like me&mdash;a little bit, don't you?" His eyes were like the
  eyes of the damned asking for water.</p>

  <p>"I like you two little bits." Billy Louise took his face between her two
  palms and smiled down at him bravely, with the pure candor that was a part of
  her. "But I don't want us to be anything but pals; not for a long while. It's
  so good, just being friends. And once we get away from that point, we can't
  go back to it again, ever. And I'm sure it's good enough to be worth while
  making it last as long as we can. So now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's going to be quite a contract, Wilhemina." Ward still looked at her
  with his heart in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, it won't! You've had lots of practice," Billy Louise assured him
  confidently and began putting the few dishes in a neat little pile. "And,
  anyway, you are perfectly able to handle any kind of a contract. All you need
  do is make up your mind. And that's made up already. So the next thing on the
  programme is to bring a bucket of water. Did you notice anything different
  about your cabin? I thought you bragged to me about being such a good
  housekeeper! Why, you hadn't swept the floor, even, since goodness knows
  when. And I've made up a bundle of your dirty shirts and things that I found
  under the bed, and I'm going to take them home and let Phoebe wash them. She
  can do them this evening and have them ready for you to bring back to-morrow.
  When I was a kid and went to see Marthy and Jase, I used to promise them
  cookies with 'raisings' in the middle. I thought there was nothing better in
  the world. I was just thinking&mdash;I'll maybe bake you some cookies with
  raisings on top, to bring home. You don't seem to waste much time cooking
  stuff. Bacon and beans, and potatoes and sour-dough bread: that seems to be
  your regular bill of fare. And tomatoes for Sunday, I reckon; I saw some
  empty cans outside. Don't you ever feel like coming down to the ranch and
  getting a square meal?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you William the Conqueror!" Ward stood with the water bucket in his
  hand, and looked at her with that smile hidden just behind his lips and his
  eyes. "You sure sabe how to make things come your way, don't you?" He started
  for the door, stopped with his toes over the threshold, and looked back at
  her. "If I knew how to get what I want, as easily as you do," he said, "we'd
  be married and keeping house before to-morrow night!" He laughed grimly at
  the start she gave. "As it is, you're the doctor, William Louisa. We remain
  mere friends!" With that he went off to the creek.</p>

  <p>He was gone at least four times as long as was necessary, but he came back
  whistling, and he did not make love to her except with his eyes.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THIS PAL BUSINESS</h2>

  <p class="first">"YOU'VE got quite a lot of hay put up, I see," Billy Louise
  remarked, when they were leaving.</p>

  <p>"Sure. I told you I've been working." Ward's tone was cheerful to the
  point of exuberance. He felt as though he could work day and night now, with
  the memory of Billy Louise's lips upon his own.</p>

  <p>"You never put up that hay alone," she told him bluntly, "and you needn't
  try to make me believe you did. I know better."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" Ward glanced over his shoulder at the stack, then
  humorously at her. He recognized the futility of trying to fool Billy Louise,
  but he was in the mood to tease her.</p>

  <p>"Humph! I've helped stack hay myself, if you please. I can tell a one-man
  stack when I see it. Who did you get to help? Junkins?"</p>

  <p>"No, a half-baked hobo I ran across. I had him here a month."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Are those your horses down there? They can't be." Last April, Billy
  Louise had been very well informed as to Ward's resources. She was evidently
  trying to match her knowledge of their well-defined limitations with what she
  saw now of prosperity in its first stages.</p>

  <p>"They are, though. A dandy span of mares. I got a bargain there."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise pondered a minute. "Ward, you aren't going into debt, are
  you?" Her tone was anxious. "It's so beastly hard to get out, once you're
  in!"</p>

  <p>"I don't owe anybody a red cent, William Louisa. Honest."</p>

  <p>"Well, but&mdash;" Billy Louise looked at him from under puckered
  brows.</p>

  <p>Ward laughed oddly. "I've been working, William. Last spring
  I&mdash;hunted wolves for awhile; old ones and dens. They'd killed a couple
  of calves for me, and I got out after them. I&mdash;made good at it; the
  bounty counts up pretty fast, you know."</p>

  <p>"Yes-s, it does." Billy Louise bit her lips thoughtfully, turned and
  looked back at the haystack, at the long line of new, wire fence, and at the
  two heavy-set mares feeding contentedly along the creek. "There must be money
  in wolves," she remarked evenly.</p>

  <p>"There is. At least, I made good money hunting them." The smile was hiding
  behind Ward's lips again and threatening to come boldly to the surface. "They
  haven't bothered you any, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Billy Louise, "they haven't. I guess they must be all up your
  way."</p>

  <p>For the life of him Ward could not tell to a certainty whether there was
  sarcasm in her tone or whether she spoke in perfect innocence. The shrewdest
  of us deceive ourselves sometimes. Ward might have known he could not fool
  Billy Louise, who had careworn experience of the cost of ranch improvements
  and could figure almost the exact number of wolf-bounties it would take to
  pay for what he had put into his claim. Still, he was right in thinking she
  would not quiz him beyond a certain point. She seemed to have reached that
  point quite suddenly, for she did not say another word about Ward's
  affairs.</p>

  <p>"What all's been happening in the world, anyway?" he asked, when they had
  exhausted some very trivial subjects. "Your world, I mean. Anything new or
  startling taken place?"</p>

  <p>"Not a thing. Marthy was down last week and spent the day with us. I never
  saw anybody change as much as she has. She looks almost neat, these days. And
  she can't talk about anything but Charlie and how well he's doing. She lets
  him do most of the managing, I think. And he had some money left to him, this
  spring, and has put it into cattle. He bought quite a lot of mixed stock from
  Seabeck and some from Winters and Nelson, Marthy says. I passed some of his
  cattle coming up."</p>

  <p>"Going to have a rival in the business, am I?" Ward laughed. "I was
  figuring on being the only thriving young cattle-king in this neck of the
  woods, myself."</p>

  <p>"Well, Charlie's in a fair way to beat you to it. I wish," sighed Billy
  Louise, "some kind person would leave me a bunch of money. Don't you? Cattle
  are coming up a little all the time. I'd like to own a lot more than I
  do."</p>

  <p>"Well, we&mdash;" Ward stopped and reconsidered. "If wolfing continues to
  pay like it has done," he said, with a twitch of the lips, "I intend to stick
  my little Y6 monogram on a few more cowhides before snow flies, William. And
  when you've had enough of this friend business&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, by that time we'll all be rich!" Billy Louise declared lightly, and
  for a wonder Ward was wise enough to let that close the subject.</p>

  <p>"We're getting neighbors down below, too," she observed later. "I didn't
  tell you that. Down the river a few miles. The country is settling up all the
  time," she sighed. "Pretty soon there won't be any more wilderness left. I
  like it up where you've located. That will stay wild forever, won't it? They
  can't plant spuds on those hills, anyway.</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;did you hear, Ward? Seabeck and some of the others have been
  losing stock, they say. You know Marthy lost four calves last fall, by some
  means. Charlie Fox was terribly worried about it, though it was his own
  fault, and&mdash;well, I thought at the time someone had taken them, and I
  think so still. And just the other day one of Seabeck's men stopped at the
  ranch, and he told me they're shy some cows and calves. They can't imagine
  what went with them, and they're lying low and not saying anything much about
  it. You haven't heard or seen anything, have you, Ward?"</p>

  <p>"I've stuck so close to the hills I haven't heard or seen anything," Ward
  affirmed. "It's amazing, the way the days slip by when a fellow's busy all
  the time. Except for two trips out the other way, to Hardup, I haven't been
  three miles from my claim all spring."</p>

  <p>"Hardup! That's where the bank was robbed, a few weeks ago, isn't it? The
  stage-driver told me about it."</p>

  <p>"I don't know; I hadn't heard anything about it. I haven't been there for
  a month and more," said Ward easily. "Nearer two months, come to think of it.
  I was there after a mower and rake and some wire."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" Billy Louise glanced at him sidelong and added several more wolves
  to the number she had mentally put down to Ward's credit.</p>

  <p>Ward twisted in the saddle so that he faced her, and his eyes were dancing
  with mischief. "Honest, William, I'm not wading into debt. Every cent I've
  put into that place this summer I made hunting wolves. That's a fact,
  Wilhemina."</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd tell me how, so I can do it, too," Billy Louise sighed,
  convinced by his tone and flat statement, yet feeling certain there was some
  "catch" to it, after all. It was exactly like a riddle that sounds perfectly
  plain and simple to the ears, and to the reason utterly impossible.</p>

  <p>"Well, I will&mdash;when you're through playing pals," he assured her
  cruelly. Ward did not know women very well, but he believed curiosity to be
  one of the strongest traits in the sex. "That's a bargain, William Louisa,
  and I'll shake hands on it if you like. When you've had enough of this
  just-friend business, I'll show you how I dig dollars outa wolf-dens." He
  grinned at the puzzled face of her. It was a riddle, and he had practically
  put the answer before her, and still she could not see it. There was a little
  streak of devilment in Ward, and happiness was uncovering the streak.</p>

  <p>"I never said I was crazy to know," Billy Louise squelched him promptly.
  "Not that crazy, anyway. I'll live quite as long without knowing, I
  reckon."</p>

  <p>She almost won her point&mdash;because Ward did not know women very well.
  He hesitated, gave her a quick, questioning glance, and actually opened his
  lips to tell her all about it. He got as far as, "Oh, well, I suppose I'll
  have to&mdash;" when Billy Louise saw a rattlesnake in the trail ahead and
  spurred up to kill it with her rope. She really was crazy to know the answer
  to the riddle, but a rattlesnake will interrupt anything from a proposal of
  marriage to a murder.</p>

  <p>Ward's fingers had gone into the pocket in his shirt where the nugget he
  had found that morning was sagging the cloth a little. He had been on the
  point of giving it to Billy Louise, but he let it stay where it was and
  instead took down his own rope to get after the snake, that had crawled under
  a bush and there showed a disposition to fight. And since Blue was no fonder
  of rattlesnakes than he was of mud, Billy Louise could not bring him close
  enough for a direct blow.</p>

  <p>"Get back, and I'll show you why I named this cayuse Rattler," Ward
  shouted. "I'll bet I've killed five hundred snakes with him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Almost as many as you have wolves!" Billy Louise snapped back at him and
  so lost her point just when she had practically gained it. Ward certainly
  would not tell her, after that stab.</p>

  <p>Rattler perked his ears forward toward the strident buzzing which once
  heard is never forgotten, and which is never heard without a tensing of
  nerves. He sighted the snake, coiled and ready for war in the small shade of
  a rabbit-bush. He circled the spot warily, his head turned sidewise, and his
  eyes fixed upon the flattened, ugly head with its thread of a darting
  tongue.</p>

  <p>Ward pulled his gun, "threw down" on the snake, and cut off its head with
  a bullet.</p>

  <p>"I could have done that myself," Billy Louise asserted jealously.</p>

  <p>"Well, I forgot. Next time I'll let you do the shooting. I was going to
  show you how Rattler helps. He'll circle around just right so I can make one
  swing of the rope do. But Mr. Snake stuck too close to that rabbit brush; and
  I was afraid if I drove him out of there with my rope, he'd get under those
  rocks. I'm sorry, Wilhemina. I didn't think."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can get all the snake-shooting I want, any time." Billy Louise
  laughed good-humoredly. "I wish you'd give Blue a few lessons&mdash;the old
  sinner!"</p>

  <p>"Not on your life, I won't." Ward leaned from the saddle, picked up the
  snake by the tail, pinched off the rattles, and dropped the repulsive thing
  to the ground with a slight shiver of relief. He gave the rattles to Billy
  Louise. "I'm glad Blue does feel a wholesome respect for rattlers; he'll take
  better care of himself&mdash;and his mistress. With me it doesn't
  matter."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;doesn't it?" asked Billy Louise, and there was that in her tone
  that made Ward's heart give a flop. "There's some of Marthy's cattle right
  ahead," she added hurriedly, seizing the first trifle with which to
  neutralize the effect of that tone.</p>

  <p>"MK monogram," said Ward absently, reading the brand mechanically, as is
  the habit of your true range man. "Pretty fresh, too. Must have just bought
  them."</p>

  <p>"He got them a month or so ago," said Billy Louise. "Marthy
  says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A month?" Ward turned and gave the cow nearest him a keener look. "Pretty
  good condition," he observed, quite idly. "Say, William, when these hills get
  filled up with Y6es and big Ds, all these other scrub critters will have to
  hunt new range, won't they?"</p>

  <p>"It will be a long while before the big Ds crowd out so much as a crippled
  calf," Billy Louise answered pessimistically. "I lost two nice heifers, a
  week or so ago. They broke through the upper fence into the alfalfa and
  started to fill up, of course. They were dead when I found them."</p>

  <p>"Next time I cash in my wolf&mdash;" Ward started to promise, but she cut
  him short.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if we stop at the Cove, Ward? Mommie wanted me to stop and
  get some currants. Marthy says they're ripe, and she has more than she knows
  what to do with."</p>

  <p>"I don't mind&mdash;if you're dead sure it's the currants."</p>

  <p>"You certainly are in a pestering mood to-day," Billy Louise protested,
  laughing. "You can't jump any game on that trail, smarty. Charlie Fox is a
  perfectly lovely young man, but he's got a girl in Wyoming. The stage-driver
  says there's never been a trip in that he didn't take a letter from the Cove
  box to Miss Gertrude M. Shannon, Elk Valley, Wyoming. So you needn't
  try&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nice, mouthy stage-driver," Ward commented. "Foxy ought to land on him a
  few times and see if he'd take the hint."</p>

  <p>"Well, I knew it before he told me. Marthy said last winter that Charlie's
  engaged. He's trying to get prosperous enough to marry her and bring her out
  to the Cove; it will be his when Marthy dies, anyway. I must say Charlie's a
  hustler, all right. He keeps a man all the time now, since he bought more
  cattle. Peter Howling Dog's working for him. Charlie's tried to range-herd
  his cattle so he and Peter can gather them alone; and he offered to look
  after mine, too, so I won't have so much riding to do this hot weather. He's
  awfully nice, Ward, really. I don't care if he is a rah-rah boy. And he isn't
  a bit in love with me."</p>

  <p>"Is it possible," grinned Ward, "that any human man can come out West and
  not fall in love with the Prairie Flower&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ward Warren, do you want me to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But it's breaking all the rules of romance, Bill-the-Conk!" Ward
  persisted. "No story-sharp would ever stand for a thing like that. Don't you
  know that the nice young man from college always takes notice in the second
  chapter, says 'By Jove! What a little beauty!' in the third, and from there
  on till the wind-up spends most of his time running around in circles because
  the beautiful flower of the rancho gives him the bad eye?" He twisted
  sidewise in the saddle, took a half-hitch with the reins around the
  saddle-horn, and proceeded to manufacture a cigarette while he went on with
  the burlesque.</p>

  <p>"It opened out according to Hoyle, a year ago, William. Nice young man
  comes west. Finds Flower of the Rancho first rattle of the box, with brave
  young buckaroo riding herd on her to beat four of a kind. Looks like there's
  no chance for our young hero. Brave buckaroo has to hie him forth to toil,
  however&mdash;" Ward paused long enough to light up, and afterwards blow out
  the match carefully before dropping it in the trail, "&mdash;at the humble
  sum of forty dollars per month. That leaves our young hero on the job
  temporarily. Stick in a few chapters of heart-burnings on the part of the
  brave buckaroo&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, no doubt!" from Billy Louise, who was trying not to giggle.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he had 'em, far as that goes. Brave buckaroo had heart-burnings
  enough for a Laura Jean Libbey romance. All according to Hoyle. Young
  hero&mdash; Say, Bill, what's the matter with that gazabo, anyway? Hasn't he
  got good eyesight, or what? Can't the chump see he's overlooking a bet
  when&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you make me sick!" Billy Louise slashed at a ripening branch of
  service berries with her quirt and scared Blue so that he lunged against the
  romancer. "You men seem to think the girl has nothing to say about it! You
  think we just sit and smile and wait for somebody to snap his fingers, and we
  jump at him! You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Didn't I say there would be several chapters where the haughty beauty
  keeps our young hero running around in circles, and the brave buckaroo can't
  figure out whether he ought to buy a ring or more shells for his
  six-gun?"</p>

  <p>"With the inference that she flops into his arms in the last chapter and
  hides her maidenly blushes against the pocket where he keeps his sack of Bull
  Durham and papers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you Bill-the-Conk! It would be the brave buckaroo in the last chapter
  then, would it?" Ward leaned close, swift tenderness putting the teasing
  twinkle to flight from his eyes. "Our young hero smokes a briar,
  Wilhemina-mine!"</p>

  <p>"We-el&mdash;don't skip!" cried Billy Louise, backing away from him with
  more blushes than any girl could hope to hide behind a coat of tan. "There's
  lots of chapters before the last. And you've got to read them straight
  through and&mdash;no fair skipping!"</p>

  <p>"Wilhemina-mine!" Ward repeated the newly invented appellation, which
  seemed to approach satisfactorily close to the line of forbidden
  endearments.</p>

  <p>"Oh, for pity's sake! I never knew you to act so." Billy Louise scowled
  unconvincingly at him from a safe distance.</p>

  <p>"I never was kissed before," blurted Ward foolhardily, kicking Rattler
  closer.</p>

  <p>"Well, if that's what ails you, I'll see it doesn't happen again,"
  retorted Billy Louise squelchingly, and Ward's self-assurance was not great
  enough to lift him over the barrier of that rebuff.</p>

  <p>They came upon Charlie Fox sitting on his horse beside the crude mail-box,
  reading avidly a letter of many crisp, close-written pages. Billy Louise
  flashed Ward an I-told-you-so glance.</p>

  <p>"Why, how do you do?" Charlie came out of cloudland with a start and
  turned to them cordially, while he hastily folded the letter. "Going down
  into the Cove? That's good. I was just up after the mail. How are things up
  your way, Warren?"</p>

  <p>"Fine as silk." Ward's eyes swung briefly toward what he considered the
  chief bit of fineness.</p>

  <p>"That's good. Trail's a little narrow for three, isn't it? I'll ride ahead
  and open the gate."</p>

  <p>"They've got a new gate down here," said Billy Louise trivially. "I forgot
  that important bit of news."</p>

  <p>"Well, it is important&mdash;to us Covers," smiled Charlie, glancing back
  at them. "No more bars to be left down accidentally. This gate shuts itself,
  in case someone forgets."</p>

  <p>"And you haven't lost any more cattle, have you?" The question was a
  statement, after Billy Louise's habit.</p>

  <p>"Not out of the Cove, at any rate. I&mdash;can't speak so positively as to
  the outside stock&mdash;of course."</p>

  <p>"You've missed some?" Billy Louise never permitted a tone to slip past her
  without tagging it immediately with plain English. Charlie's tone had said
  something to which his words made no reference.</p>

  <p>"I don't like to say that, Miss Louise. Very likely they have
  stray&mdash;drifted, I mean&mdash;back toward their home ranch. Peter and I
  can't keep cases very closely, of course."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise shifted uneasily in the saddle and pulled her eyebrows
  together. "If you think you've lost some cattle, for heaven's sake why don't
  you say so!" (Ward smiled to himself at her tone.) "If there's anything I
  hate, it's hinting and never coming right out with anything. Have you lost
  any?"</p>

  <p>Charlie turned with a hand on the cantle and faced her with polite
  reproach. "Peter says we have," he admitted, with very evident reluctance. "I
  hardly think so myself. I'd have to count them. I know, of course, how many
  we've bought in the last year."</p>

  <p>"Well, Peter knows more about it than you do," Billy Louise told him
  bluntly. "If he has missed any, they're probably gone."</p>

  <p>"I was in hopes you would be on my side, Miss Louise." Charlie smiled
  deprecatingly. "I've argued with Aunt Martha and Peter until&mdash; But I
  didn't know you were a confirmed pessimist as well!"</p>

  <p>"You didn't neglect to put your brand on them, did you?" asked Billy
  Louise cruelly.</p>

  <p>Charlie flushed under the sunburn. "Really, Miss Louise, you've no mercy
  on a tenderfoot, have you?" he protested. "No, they are all branded, really
  they are. Peter and Aunt Martha saw to that," he confessed naïvely.</p>

  <p>"It seems queer," said Billy Louise, thinking aloud. "Ward, there
  certainly is rustling going on around here; and no one seems to know a thing
  beyond the mere fact that they're losing cattle. Seabeck has lost
  some&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, are you sure?" Charlie's eyes widened perceptibly. "I hadn't heard
  that. By Jove! It sort of makes a fellow feel shaky about going into cattle
  very strong, doesn't it? It&mdash;it knocks off the profits like the very
  deuce, to keep losing one here and there."</p>

  <p>"A fellow has to figure on a certain percentage of loss," said Ward. "This
  the new gate?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Charlie seemed relieved by the diversion. "Just merely a gate, as
  you see; but we Covers are proud of every little improvement. Aunt Martha
  comes up here every day, I verily believe, just to look at it and admire it.
  The poor old soul never had any conveniences that she couldn't make herself,
  you know, and she thinks this is great stuff. I put this padlock on it so she
  can lock herself in, nights when I'm away. She feels better with the gate
  locked. And then I've got a dog that's as good as a company of soldiers
  himself. If either of you happen down here when there's no one about, you
  will have to introduce yourselves to Cerberus&mdash;so named because he
  guards the gates&mdash;not the gate to Hades, please remember. Surbus, Aunt
  Martha calls him, which is good Idahoese and seems to please him as well as
  any other. Just speak to him by name&mdash;Surbus if you like&mdash;and he
  will be all right, I think." He held open the gate for them to ride through
  and gave them a comradely look and smile as they passed.</p>

  <p>Ward took in the details of the heavy gate that barred the gorge. He did
  not know that he betrayed the fact even to the sharp eyes of Billy Louise,
  but he could not quite bring himself to the point of meeting Charlie Fox
  anywhere near half-way in his overtures for friendship.</p>

  <p>"The weight is so heavy that the gate shuts and latches itself, you see,"
  Charlie went on, mounting on the inside of the barrier and following
  cheerfully after them. "But that doesn't satisfy Aunt Martha. She and Surbus
  make a special pilgrimage up here every night."</p>

  <p>"She must be pretty nervous." Ward could not quite see why such
  precautions were necessary in a country where no man locked his door against
  the world.</p>

  <p>"Well, she is, though you wouldn't suspect it, would you? When one thinks
  of the life she has lived, and how she pioneered in here when the country was
  straight wilderness, and all that. Of course, I didn't know her before Uncle
  Jason died&mdash;do you think she has changed since, Miss Louise?"</p>

  <p>"Lots," Billy Louise assured him briefly. She was wondering why Ward was
  so stiff and unnatural with Charlie Fox.</p>

  <p>"I think myself that the shock of losing him must have made the difference
  in her. There's Surbus; how's that for a voice? And he's just as
  blood-thirsty as he sounds, too. I'd hate to have him tackle me in the gorge,
  on a dark night. He's too savage, though it's only with strangers, and we
  don't see many of them. He almost ate Peter up, when he first came. And he
  gave you quite a scare last spring, didn't he, Miss Louise?"</p>

  <p>"He came within an ace of getting his head shot off," Billy Louise
  qualified laconically. "Marthy came out just in the nick of time. I
  absolutely refuse to be chewed up by any dog; and I don't care who he belongs
  to."</p>

  <p>"Same here, William," approved Ward.</p>

  <p>Charlie laughed. "I see Surbus is not going to be popular with the
  neighbors," he said easily. "I do feel very apologetic over him. But Marthy
  wanted me to get a dog, and so when a fellow offered me this one, I took him;
  and as Surbus happened to take a fancy to me, I didn't realize what a savage
  brute he is, till he tackled Peter&mdash;and then Miss Louise."</p>

  <p>"Well, Miss Louise was perfectly able to defend herself, so you needn't
  feel apologetic about that," said Billy Louise a trifle sharply. She hated
  Surbus, and she was quite open in her hatred. "If he ever comes at me again,
  and nobody calls him off, I shall shoot him." It was not a threat, as she
  spoke it, but a plain statement of a fact. "You'd better serve notice too,
  Ward. He's a nasty beast, and he'd just as soon kill a person as not. He was
  going to jump for my throat. He was crouched, just ready to spring&mdash;and
  I had my gun out&mdash;when Marthy saw us and gave a yell fit to wake the
  dead. Surbus didn't jump, and I didn't shoot. That's how close he came to
  being a dead dog."</p>

  <p>She glanced at Ward and then furtively at Charlie Fox. If expression meant
  anything, Surbus was yet in danger of paying for that assault. She caught
  Ward's truculent eye, smiled, and shook her head at him. "We're pretty fair
  friends now," she said. "At least, we don't try to kill each other whenever
  we meet. 'Armed neutrality' fits our case fine."</p>

  <p>"I think I'll volunteer under your flag," said Ward. "I'll leave Cerberus
  alone as long as he leaves me and my friends alone. But I'd advise him not to
  start anything."</p>

  <p>"That's all Surbus or anyone else can ask. Come on, old fellow! Pardon
  me," he added to his companions and rode past them to meet the great,
  heavy-jowled dog. "Be still, Surbus. We're all friends, here."</p>

  <p>The dog lifted a non-committal glance to Ward's face, growled deep in his
  chest, and dropped behind, nosing the tracks of Blue and Rattler as if he
  would identify them and fix them in his memory for future use.</p>

  <p>Ward had never seen the Cove in summer. He looked about him curiously,
  struck by the atmosphere of quiet plenty. Over the crude fence hung
  fruit-laden branches from the jungle within. There was a smell of ripening
  plums in the air, and the hum of bees. Somewhere in the orchard a wild canary
  was singing. If he could live down here, he thought, with Billy Louise and
  none other near, he would ask no odds of the world or of heaven. He glanced
  at Charlie Fox enviously. Well, he had a fairly well-sheltered place of his
  own, up there in the hills. He could set out fruit and plants and things and
  have a little Eden of his own; though of course it couldn't be like this
  place, sheltered as it was from harsh winds by that high rock wall, and
  soaking in sunshine all day long. Still, he could fix his place up a lot,
  with a little time and thought and a good deal of hard work.</p>

  <p>He looked at Billy Louise and saw how the beauty of the place appealed to
  her, and right there he decided to study horticulture so that he could raise
  plums and apples and hollyhocks and things.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; WAS IT THE DOG?</h2>

  <p class="first">"THAT old dame down there thinks a lot of you, William."
  Ward had closed the gate and was preparing to remount.</p>

  <p>"Well, is there any reason why she shouldn't?" The tone of Billy Louise
  was not far from petulant.</p>

  <p>"Not a reason. What's molla, Bill?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing that I know of." Billy Louise lifted her eyes to the rock
  cabbages on the cliff above them and tried to speak convincingly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is. Something's gone wrong. Can't you tell a pal,
  Wilhemina?"</p>

  <p>There was no resisting that tone. Billy Louise looked at him, and though
  she still frowned, her eyes lightened a little.</p>

  <p>"No, I can't tell a pal&mdash;or anybody else. I don't know. Something's
  different, down there. I don't know what it is, and I don't like it." She
  thought a minute and then smiled with that little twist of the lips Ward
  liked so much. "Maybe it's the dog," she guessed. "I never see his ugly mug
  that I don't feel like taking a shot at him. I like dogs, too, as a general
  thing. He's got a wicked heart! I know he has. He'd like nothing better than
  to take a chunk out of me."</p>

  <p>"I'll go back and kill him; shall I, Bill Loo?"</p>

  <p>"No. Some day maybe I'll get a chance at him myself. I've warned Marthy,
  so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are you dead sure it's the dog?" Ward looked at her with that keenness of
  glance which was hard to meet if one wanted to keep a secret from him.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Billy Louise's tone did not invite further questioning.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing! I just wondered."</p>

  <p>"You don't like Charlie; anybody can see that."</p>

  <p>"Yes? Foxy's a real nice young man."</p>

  <p>"But you don't like him. You never do like anybody&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No?" Ward's smile dared her to persist in the accusation. "In that case
  I've no business to be fooling around here when there's work to be done. That
  Cove down there has roused a heap of brand-new wants in me, Wilhemina. Gotta
  have an orchard up on Mill Creek, lady-fair. Gotta have a flower garden and
  things that climb all over the house and smell nice. Gotta have four times as
  much meadow as I've got now, and a house full of books and pictures and
  things, and more cattle and horses, and a yellow canary in a yellow cage
  singing his head off out on the porch. Gotta work like one son-of-a-gun,
  Wilhemina, to get all those things and get 'em quick, so I can stand some
  show of&mdash;getting what I really do want."</p>

  <p>"Well, am I keeping you?" Billy Louise was certainly in a villainous
  mood.</p>

  <p>"You are," Ward affirmed quite calmly. "Only for you, I'd be hustling like
  the mischief right this minute along the get-rich trail. Say, Bill, I don't
  believe it's the dog!" He looked at her with the smile hiding just behind his
  lips and his eyes. And behind the smile, if one's insight were keen enough to
  see it, was a troubled anxiety. He shifted the pail of currants to the other
  arm and spoke again: "What is it, Wilhemina? Something's bothering you. Can't
  you tell a fellow what it is?"</p>

  <p>"No, I can't." Billy Louise spoke crossly. "I've got a headache. I've been
  riding ever since this morning, and I should think that's reason enough. I
  wish to goodness you'd let me alone. Go on back to work, if you're so crazy
  about working; I'm sure I don't want to hinder you in any of your
  get-rich-quick schemes!" She shut her teeth together with a click, jerked
  Blue angrily into the trail when he had merely stepped out of it to avoid a
  rock, and managed to make him as conscious of her mood as was Ward.</p>

  <p>Ward eyed her unobtrusively with his face set straight ahead. He glanced
  down at the pail of currants, which was heavy, and at the trail, which was
  long and lonely. He twisted his lips in brief sarcasm&mdash;for he had a
  temper of his own&mdash;and rode on with his neck set very stiff and his eyes
  a trifle harder than they had ever been before when Billy Louise rode
  alongside. He did not turn off at the ford&mdash;and Billy Louise betrayed by
  a quick glance at him that she had half expected him to desert her
  there&mdash;but crossed it beside her and rode on up the hill.</p>

  <p>He had made up his mind that he would not speak to her again until she
  wiped out, by apology or a change of manner, that last offensive remark of
  hers. He hoped she realized that he was only going with her to carry the
  currants, and he hoped she realized also that, if she had been any other
  person who had spoken to him like that, he would have dumped the currants on
  the ground and ridden off and left her to her own devices.</p>

  <p>He did not once speak to Billy Louise on the way to the Wolverine; but his
  silence changed gradually from stubbornness to pure abstraction, as they rode
  leisurely along the dusty trail with the sunset glowing before them. He
  almost forgot the actual presence of Billy Louise, and he did actually forget
  her mood. He was planning just how and where he should plant his orchard, and
  he was mentally building an addition to the cabin and screening a porch wide
  enough to hang a hammock inside, and he was seeing Billy Louise luxuriously
  swinging in that hammock while he sat close, and smoked and teased and
  gloried in his possession of her companionship.</p>

  <p>His thoughts shuttled to his little mine, though he seldom dignified it by
  that title. He speculated upon the amount of gold he might yet hope to wash
  out of that gravel streak, though he had held himself sternly back from such
  mental indulgence all the spring. He felt that he was going to need every
  grain of gold he could glean. He wanted his wife&mdash;he glowed at the mere
  thinking of that name&mdash;to have the nicest little home in the country. He
  decided that it would be pleasanter than the Cove, all things considered; he
  had a fine view of the rugged hills from his cabin, and he imagined the Cove
  must be pretty hot during the days, with that high rock wall shutting off the
  wind and reflecting the sun. His own place was sheltered, but still it was
  not set down in the bottom of a well. She had liked it. She had said...</p>

  <p>They rode over the crest of the bluff and down the steep trail into the
  Wolverine. However cloudy the atmosphere between the two, the ride had seemed
  short&mdash;so short that Ward felt the jar of surprise when he looked down
  and saw the cabin below them. He glanced at Billy Louise, guessed from her
  somber face that the villainous mood still held her, and sighed a little. He
  was not deeply concerned by her mood. He understood her too well to descend
  into any slough of despondence because she was cross. Then he remembered the
  reason she had given&mdash;the reason he had not believed at the time. They
  were down by the gate, then.</p>

  <p>"Head still ache, William?" he asked, in the tone which he could make a
  fair substitute for a caress.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Billy Louise, and did not look at him.</p>

  <p>Ward was inwardly skeptical, but he did not tell her so. He swung off his
  horse, set down the pail of currants, and took Blue by the bridle.</p>

  <p>"You go on in. I'll unsaddle," he commanded her quietly. And Billy Louise,
  after a perceptible hesitation, obeyed him without looking at him or speaking
  a word.</p>

  <p>If Ward resented her manner, which was unreasonably uppish, he could not
  have chosen a more effective revenge. He talked with Mrs. MacDonald all
  through supper and paid no attention to Billy Louise. After supper he spied a
  fairly fresh Boise paper, and underneath that lay the <i>Butte Miner</i>.
  That discovery settled the evening, so far as he was concerned. If he and
  Billy Louise had been on the best of terms, it is doubtful if she could have
  dragged his attention from those papers.</p>

  <p>Several times Billy Louise looked at him as though she meditated going
  over and snatching them away from him, but she resisted the temptation and
  continued to behave as a nice young woman should behave toward a guest. She
  left him sitting inside by the lamp, which her mother had lighted for his
  especial convenience, and went out and sat on the doorstep and stared at the
  dusky line of hills and at the Big Dipper. She was trying to think out the
  tangle of tiny, threadlike mysteries that had enmeshed her thoughts and
  tightened her nerves until she could not speak a decent word to anyone.</p>

  <p>She felt that the lives of those around her were weaving puzzle-patterns,
  and that she must guess the puzzles. And she felt as though part of the
  patterns had been left out, so that there were ragged points thrusting
  themselves upon her notice&mdash;points that did not point to anything.</p>

  <p>She sat with her elbows on her knees and her chin in her cupped palms, and
  scowled at the Big Dipper as if it held the answer away up there beyond her
  reach. Where did Ward get the money to do all the things he had done, this
  spring and summer? If he expected her to believe that wolf story&mdash;! What
  became of the cattle that had disappeared, by twos and threes and sometimes
  more, in the last few months? Was there a gang of thieves operating in the
  country, and where did they stay? Why had Ward hinted that she did not like
  Charlie Fox, and why didn't he himself like Charlie? Why had she felt that
  weight of depression creep over her when they were leaving the Cove? Why?
  Why? Billy Louise tried to bring her cold, common sense to the front. She had
  found it a most effective remedy for most moods. Now it assured her
  impatiently that every question&mdash;save one&mdash;had been born in her own
  super-sensitive self. That one definite question was the first one she had
  tried to answer. It kept asking itself, over and over, until in desperation
  Billy Louise went to bed and tried to forget it in sleep.</p>

  <p>Somewhere about midnight&mdash;she had heard the clock strike eleven a
  long while ago&mdash;she scared her mother by sitting up suddenly in bed and
  exclaiming relievedly: "Oh, I know; it's some new poison! He poisons
  them!"</p>

  <p>"Wake up! For the land's sake, what are you dreaming about?" Her mother
  shook her agitatedly by the arm. "Billy Louise! Wake up!"</p>

  <p>"All right, mommie." Billy Louise lay down and snuggled the light blanket
  over her shoulders. She had been awake and thinking, thinking till she
  thought she never could stop, but she did not tell mommie that. She went to
  sleep and dreamed about poisoned wolves till it is a wonder she did not have
  a real nightmare. The question was answered, and for the time being the
  answer satisfied her.</p>

  <p>Ward was surely an unusual type of young man. He did not seem to remember,
  the next morning, that there had been any outbreak of bottled emotions on his
  part the day before, or any ill-temper on the part of Billy Louise, or
  anything at all out of the ordinary. Billy Louise had prepared herself to
  apologize&mdash;in some roundabout manner which would effect a reconciliation
  without hurting her pride too much&mdash;and she was rather chagrined to
  discover that Ward seemed neither to expect or to want any apology.</p>

  <p>"Sorry I gotta go, William," he volunteered whimsically soon after
  breakfast. "But I gotta dig. Say, Wilhemina, if I stay away long enough, will
  you come after me again?"</p>

  <p>"A wise man," said Billy Louise evasively, "may do a foolish thing once,
  but only a fool does it twice."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it's the dog." Ward shook his head at her in mock
  meditation. "It wouldn't last overnight, if it was just the dog." He looked
  at her with the hidden smile. "Are you sure&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you know how to pester a person!" The lips of Billy Louise
  twisted humorously. "Lots of things bother me, and you ought to help me out
  instead of making it worse." She walked beside him down to the corral where
  Rattler was waiting, saddled and bridled for the homeward journey.</p>

  <p>"Well, tell a fellow what they are. Of course, if it's the dog&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ward Warren, you're awful! It isn't the dog. Well, it is, but there are
  heaps of other things I want to know, that I don't know. And you don't seem
  to care about any single one of them."</p>

  <p>Ward leaned up against the fence and tilted his hat to shade his eyes from
  the sun. "Name a few of them, William Louisa. Not even a brave young buckaroo
  can be expected to mind-read a girl. If he could&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, is it poison you use?" Billy Louise thought it best to change
  Ward's trend of thought immediately. "Last night it just came to me all at
  once that you must have found some poison besides strychnine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Eh? Oh, I see!" He managed a rather provoking slur on the last word. "No,
  William." His eyes twinkled at her. "It isn't poison. What's the other thing
  you want to know?"</p>

  <p>Billy Louise frowned, hesitated, and, accepting the rebuff, went on to the
  next question: "What went with Seabeck's cattle, and Marthy and Charlie's,
  and all the others that have disappeared? You don't seem to care at all that
  there seems to be rustling going on around here."</p>

  <p>Ward gave her a quick look. His tone changed a bit: "I don't know that
  there is any. I never yet lived in a cow-country where there wasn't more or
  less talk of&mdash;rustling. You don't want to take gossip like that too
  seriously. Anything more?"</p>

  <p>Billy Louise glanced at him surreptitiously and looked away again. Then
  she tried to go on as casually as she had begun.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's something about the Cove. I don't believe Marthy's happy. I
  couldn't quite get hold of the thing yesterday that gave me the
  blues&mdash;but it's Marthy. She's grieving, or something. She's different.
  She's changed more since last winter than she's changed since I can remember.
  You noticed something&mdash;at least you spoke about her coming up the
  gorge&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I said she thinks a lot of you, Wilhemina." Ward's tone and manner were
  natural again. "I noticed her looking at you when you didn't know it. She
  thinks a heap of you, I should say, and she's worrying about something. Maybe
  she'd rather have you in the Cove than Miss Gertrude M. Shannon. Don't you
  reckon an old lady that has had her own way all her life kind of dreads the
  advent of a brand-new bride in her domain?"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course! Poor old thing! I never thought of that. And here you hit
  the nail on the head just with a chance thought. That shows what it means to
  be a brave young buckaroo, with heaps and piles of brains!" She laughed at
  him, but behind her bantering was a new respect for Ward's astuteness. "Go
  on. Tell me why you don't like Charlie Fox, or why you refuse to admit how
  nice and kind he is and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I don't refuse&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, I put it stupidly, of course, but you know what I mean. Tell me
  your candid opinion of him."</p>

  <p>"I haven't any." Ward smoked imperturbably for a minute, so that Billy
  Louise began to think he would not tell her what she wanted to know. Ward
  could be absolutely, maddeningly dumb on some subjects, as she had reason to
  know. But he continued, quite frankly for him: "Has it ever struck you,
  William Jane, that after all Foxy is not sacrificing such a hell of a lot?"
  He bit his lip because of the word he had let slip, but since Billy Louise
  took no notice, he went on: "He's got a pretty good thing, down there, if you
  stop to think. The old lady won't live always, and she's managed to build up
  a pretty fine ranch. It stands Foxy in hand to be good to her, don't you
  think? He'll have a pretty fine stake out of it. Far as I know, he's all
  right. I merely fail to see where he's got a right to wear any halo on his
  manly brow. He's got a good hand in the game, and he's playing it&mdash;a
  heap better than lots of men would. Dot's all, Wilhemina." He turned to her
  as if he would dismiss the subject. "Don't run off with the notion that I'm
  out after the heart's blood of our young hee-ro. I like him all
  right&mdash;far as he goes. I like him a heap better," he owned frankly,
  "since I glommed him devouring that letter from Miss Gertrude M. Shannon.</p>

  <p>"Don't you want to ride a ways with me?" His eyes made love while he
  waited for her to speak. "Don't?" (When she shook her head.) "You're a pretty
  mean young person sometimes, aren't you? Wha's molla? Did I give you more
  mood than I wiped off the slate?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. You say a sentence or two, and it's like slashing a knife
  into a curtain. You show all kinds of things that were nicely covered
  before." Billy Louise spoke gloomily. "I'll see Marthy as a poor old lady
  waiting to be saddled with a boss, from now on. And Charlie Fox just simply
  working for his own interests and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now, William!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can see it myself, now."</p>

  <p>"Well, what if he is? We're all of us working for our own interests,
  aren't we?" He saw the gloom still deep in her eyes and flung out both hands
  impatiently. "All right, all right! I'll plead the cause of our young hee-ro,
  then. What would old Marthy do without him? He's made her more comfortable
  than she ever was in her life, probably. I noticed a big difference in the
  cabin, yesterday. And he's doing the work, and taking the responsibility, and
  making the ranch more valuable&mdash;even put a wire on the gate, that rings
  a bell at the house, so she'll know when company's coming, and can get the
  kitchen swept. He's done a lot&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For himself!" In her disillusionment Billy Louise went too far the other
  way. "And the cabin is more comfortable for that girl when he brings her
  there to run over Marthy!"</p>

  <p>"Well, what of it? You don't expect him to put in his time for nothing, do
  you? In the last analysis we're all self-centered brutes, Wilhemina. We're
  thinking once for the other fellow and twice for ourselves, always. I'm
  working and scheming day and night to get a stake&mdash;so I can have what
  means happiness to me. Marthy's letting Foxy have full swing in the Cove,
  because that gives her an easier life than she's ever had. If she didn't want
  him there, she'd mighty quick shoo him up the gorge, or I don't know the old
  lady. We're all selfish."</p>

  <p>"I think it's a horrid world!" rebelled the youthful ideals of Billy
  Louise. "I wish you wouldn't say you're just thinking of yourself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm human," he pointed out. "I want my happiness. So do you, for that
  matter. We all want to get all we can out of life."</p>

  <p>"And at the other fellow's expense!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not necessarily. Some of us want the other fellow to be just as happy
  as we are." His look pointed the meaning for him.</p>

  <p>"I don't care; I think it's mean of Charlie Fox to bring&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Maybe not. The chances are the young lady will take to housework like a
  bear-cub to a syrup keg, and old Marthy will potter around with her flowers
  and be perfectly happy with the two of them. Cheer up, Bill Loo! Lemme have a
  smile, anyway, before I go. And I wish," he added quizzically, "you'd spare
  me some of that sympathy you've got going to waste. I'm a poor lonesome devil
  working away to get a stake, and you know why. I don't have nobody to give me
  a kind word, and I don't have no fun nor nothing, nohow. Come on and ride a
  mile or two!"</p>

  <p>"I have to help mommie," said Billy Louise, which was not true.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you won't, darn it, don't!" Ward reached down, caught her hand,
  and squeezed it, taking a chance on being seen. "Gotta go, Wilhemina-mine.
  Adios. I won't stay away so long next time." He turned away to his horse,
  stuck his foot in the stirrup; and went up into the saddle without any
  apparent effort. Then he swung Rattler close to where she stood beside the
  gate.</p>

  <p>"Sure you want to be just pals, Wilhemina-mine?" he asked, bending close
  to her.</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm sure," said Billy Louise quickly&mdash;a shade too
  quickly.</p>

  <p>Ward looked at her intently and shrugged his shoulders. "All right," he
  said, in the tone which made plain his opinion of her decision. "You're the
  doctor."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise watched him up the hill and out of sight over the top. When
  he was gone, she caught Blue and saddled him; then, with her gun buckled
  around her hips and her rope coiled beside the saddle-fork, she rode dismally
  up the canyon.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE LITTLE DEVILS OF DOUBT</h2>

  <p class="first">WOLVERINE CANYON, with the sun shining down aslant into its
  depths, was a picturesque gash in the hills, wild enough in all conscience,
  but to the normal person not in the least degree gloomy. The jutting crags
  were sunlit and warm. The cherry thickets whispered in a light breeze and
  sheltered birds that sang in perfect content. The service berries were
  ripening and hung heavy-laden branches down over the trail to tempt a rider
  into loitering. The creek leaped over rocks, slid thin blades of swift
  current between the higher bowlders, and crept stealthily down into shady
  pools, where speckled trout lay motionless except for the gently-moving tail
  and fins that held them stationary in some deeper shadow. Not a gloomy place,
  surely, when the peace of a sunny morning laid its spell upon the land.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise, however, did not respond to the canyon's enticements. She
  brooded over her own discouragements and the tantalizing little puzzles which
  somehow would not lend themselves to any convincing solution. She was in that
  condition of nervous depression where she saw her finest cows dead of bloat
  in the alfalfa meadows&mdash;and how would she pay that machinery note, then?
  She saw John Pringle calling unexpectedly and insistently for his
  "time"&mdash;and where would she find another man whom she could trust out of
  her sight? John Pringle was slow, and he was stupid and growled at poor
  Phoebe till Billy Louise wanted to shake him, but he was "steady," and that
  one virtue covers many a man's faults and keeps him drawing wages
  regularly.</p>

  <p>Her mother had been more and more inclined to worry as the hot weather
  came on; lately her anxiety over small things had rather gotten upon the
  nerves of Billy Louise. She felt ill-used and down-hearted and as if nothing
  mattered much, anyway. She passed her cave with a mere glance and scowl for
  the memories of golden days in her lonely childhood that clung around it. She
  passed Minervy's cave, and her lips quivered with self-pity because that
  childhood was gone, and she must not waste time or energy upon romantic
  "pretends," but must measure haystacks and allow so much for "settling," and
  then add and multiply and divide all over two sheets of tablet paper to find
  out how much hay she had to winter the stock on. She must hold herself
  rigidly to facts, and tend fences and watch irrigating ditches, and pay
  interest on notes three or four years old, and ride the hills and work her
  way through rocky canyons, keeping watch over the cattle that meant so much.
  She had meant to talk over things with Ward and ask his advice about certain
  details that required experienced judgment. But Ward had precipitated her
  thoughts into strange channels and so had unconsciously thwarted her
  counsel-seeking intentions. She had wanted to talk things over with Marthy,
  and Marthy had also unconsciously prevented her doing so and had filled Billy
  Louise with uneasiness and doubt which in no way concerned herself.</p>

  <p>These doubts persisted, and so did the tantalizing little puzzles. They
  weaned Billy Louise's thoughts from her own ranch worries and nagged at her
  with the persistence of a swarm of buffalo gnats.</p>

  <p>"Well, if he doesn't use poison, for goodness' sake, what does he use?"
  she asked indignantly aloud, after a period of deep thought. "I don't see why
  he wants to be so terribly secretive. He might be human enough to tell a
  person what he means. I'm sure I'd tell him, all right. I don't believe it's
  wolves at all. I don't see how&mdash;and still&mdash;I don't believe Ward
  would really lie to me."</p>

  <p>She was in this particularly dissatisfied mood when she rode out of the
  canyon at its upper end, where the hills folded softly down into grassy
  valleys where her cattle loved best to graze. Since the grass had started in
  the spring, she had kept her little herd up here among the lower hills; and
  by riding along the higher ridges every day or so and turning back a
  wandering animal now and then, she had held them in a comparatively small
  area, where they would be easily gathered in the fall. A few head of
  Seabeck's stock had wandered in amongst hers, and some of Marthy's. And there
  was a big, roan steer that bore the brand of Johnson, over on Snake River.
  Billy Louise knew them all, as a housewife knows her flock of chickens, and
  if she missed seeing certain leaders in the scattered groups, she rode until
  she found them. Two old cows and one big, red steer that seemed always to
  have a following wore bells that tinkled pleasant little sounds in the alder
  thickets along the creek, as she passed by.</p>

  <p>She rode up the long ridge which gave her a wide view of the surrounding
  hills and stopped Blue, while she stared moodily at the familiar,
  shadow-splotched expanse of high-piled ridges, with deep green valleys and
  deeper-hued canyons between. She loved them, every one; but to-day they
  failed to steep her senses in that deep content with life which only the
  great outdoors can give to one who has learned how satisfying is the draught
  and how soothing.</p>

  <p>Far over to the eastward a black dot moved up a green slope and slid out
  of sight beyond. That might be Ward, taking a short-cut across the hill to
  his claim beyond the pine-dotted ridge that looked purple in the distance.
  Billy Louise sighed with a vague disquiet and turned to look away to the
  north, where the jumble of high hills grew more rugged, with the valleys
  narrower and deeper.</p>

  <p>Here came two other dots, larger and more clearly defined as horsemen.
  From mere objects that stood higher than any animal and moved with a
  purposeful directness, they presently became men who rode with the easy swing
  of habit which has become a second nature. They must have seen her sitting
  still upon her horse in the midst of that high, sunny plateau, for they
  turned and rode up the slope toward her.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise waited, too depressed to wonder greatly who they were.
  Seabeck riders, probably; and so they proved. At least one of them was a
  Seabeck man&mdash;Floyd Carson, who had talked with her at her own gate and
  had told her of the suspected cattle-stealing. The other man was a stranger
  whom Floyd introduced as Mr. Birken.</p>

  <p>They had been "prowling around," according to Floyd, trying to see what
  they could see. Floyd was one of these round-faced, round-eyed, young fellows
  who does not believe much in secrecy and therefore talks freely whenever and
  wherever he dares. He said that Seabeck had turned them loose to keep cases
  and see if they couldn't pick up the trail of these rustlers who were trying
  to get rich off a running iron and a long rope. (If you are of the West, you
  know what that means; and if you are not, you ought to guess that it means
  stealing cattle and let it go at that.) It was not until he had talked for
  ten minutes or so that Billy Louise became more than mildly interested in the
  conversation.</p>

  <p>"Say, Miss MacDonald," Floyd asked, by way of beginning a new paragraph,
  "how about that fellow over on Mill Creek? He worked for you folks a year or
  so ago, didn't he? What does he do?"</p>

  <p>"He has a ranch," said Billy Louise with careful calm. "He's been working
  on it this summer, I believe."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh&mdash;we were over there this morning. Them Y6 cattle up above his
  place are his, I reckon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Billy Louise. "He's been putting his wages into cattle for a
  year or so. He worked for Junkins last winter. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing, I guess! Only he's the only stranger in the country, and his
  prosperity ain't accounted for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, but it is!" laughed Billy Louise. "I only wish I had half as clear a
  ticket. When he isn't working out, he's wolfing; and every dollar he gets
  hold of he puts into that ranch. We've known him a long time. He doesn't blow
  his money, you see, like most fellows do."</p>

  <p>Floyd found occasion to have a slight argument with his horse, just then.
  He happened to be one of the "most" fellows, and the occasion of his last
  "blow-out" was fresh in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Well, of course, if you know he's all straight, that settles it. But it
  sure seems queer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That fellow is straight as a string. Don't you suppose it's some gang
  over on the river, Floyd? I'd look around over there, I believe, and try to
  get a line on the unaccountables. There's a lot of new settlers come in, just
  in the last year or two, and there might be some tough ones scattered through
  the bunch. Better see if there has been any cattle shipped or driven through
  that way, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"We can try," Floyd assented without eagerness. "But as near as we can
  figure, it's too much of a drib-drab proposition for that. A cow and calf
  here and there, and so on. We got wind of it first when we went out to bring
  in a gentle cow that the deacon wanted on the ranch. We knew where she was,
  only she wasn't there when we went after her. We hunted the hills for a week
  and couldn't find a sign of her or her calf. And she had stuck down in the
  creek bottom all the spring, so it looked kinda funny." He twisted in the
  saddle and looked back at the pine-clotted ridge.</p>

  <p>"There's a Y6 calf up there that's a dead ringer for the one we've been
  hunting," he observed. "But it's running with a cow that carries Junkins' old
  brand, So&mdash;" He looked apologetically into the calm eyes of Billy
  Louise. "Of course, I don't mean to say there's anything wrong up there," he
  hastily assured her. "But that's the reason I thought I'd ask you about that
  fellow."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's perfectly right to make sure of everybody," smiled Billy Louise.
  "I'd do the same thing myself. But you'll find everything's all straight up
  there. We know all about him, and how and where he got his few head of stock,
  and everything. But of course you could ask Junkins, if you have any
  doubt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, we'll take your word for it. I just wanted to know; he's a stranger
  to our outfit. I've seen him a few times; what's his name? Us boys call him
  Noisy. It's like pulling a wisdom tooth to get any kinda talk out of
  him."</p>

  <p>"He is awful quiet," assented Billy Louise carelessly. "But he's real
  steady to work."</p>

  <p>"Them quiet fellows generally are," put in Mr. Birken. "You run stock in
  here too, do you, Miss MacDonald?"</p>

  <p>"The big Ds," answered Billy Louise and smiled faintly. "I've been
  range-herding them back here in these foothills this summer. Do you want to
  look through the bunch?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Birkin blushed. "Oh, no, not at all! I was wondering if you had lost
  any."</p>

  <p>"Nobody would rustle cattle from a lady, I hope? At any rate, I haven't
  missed any yet. The folks down in the Cove have, though."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I heard they had. That breed rode over to see if he could get a line
  on them. It's hard luck; that Charlie Fox seems a fine, hard-working boy,
  don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"Yes-s," said Billy Louise shyly, "he seems real nice." She looked away
  and bit her lip self-consciously as she spoke.</p>

  <p>The two men swallowed the bait like a hungry fish. They glanced at each
  other and winked knowingly. Billy Louise saw them from the tail of her
  downcast eye, and permitted herself a little sigh of relief. They would be
  the more ready now to accept at its face value her statement concerning Ward,
  unless they credited her with the feat of being in love with the two men at
  the same time.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm sorry Charlie Fox has been tapped off, too. He's a mighty fine
  chap," declared Floyd with transparent heartiness, his round eyes dwelling
  curiously upon the face of Billy Louise.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I must be going," said that young woman self-consciously. "I've
  quite a circle to ride yet. I hope you locate the rustlers, and if there's
  anything I can do&mdash;if I see or hear anything that seems to be a
  clew&mdash;I'll let you know right away. I've been keeping my eyes open for
  some trace of them, and&mdash;so has Char&mdash;Mr. Fox." Then she blushed
  and told them good-by very hastily and loped off up the ridge.</p>

  <p>"Bark up that tree for awhile, you two!" she said, with a twist of her
  lips, when she was well away from them. "You&mdash;you darned idiots! To go
  prowling around Ward's place, just as if&mdash; Ward'll take a shot at them
  if he catches them nosing through his stock!" She scowled at a big D cow that
  thrust her head out of an alder thicket and sent Blue in after her. Frowning,
  she watched the animal go lumbering down the hill toward the Wolverine. "Just
  because he's a stranger and doesn't mix with people, and minds his own
  business and is trying to get a start, they're suspicious&mdash;as if a man
  has no right to&mdash; Well, I think I managed to head them off, anyway."</p>

  <p>Her satisfaction lasted while she rode to the next ridge. Then the little
  devils of doubt came a-swarming and a-whispering. She had said she knew all
  about Ward; well, she did, to a greater extent than others knew.
  But&mdash;she wondered if she did not know too much, or if she knew enough.
  There were some things&mdash; She turned, upon the crest of the ridge, and
  looked away toward the pine-dotted height locally known as the Big Hill,
  beyond which Ward's claim lay snuggled out of sight in its little valley.
  "I've a good mind to ride over there right now, and make him tell me," she
  said to herself. She stopped Blue and sat there undecided, while the wind
  lifted a lock of hair and flipped it across her cheek. "If he
  cares&mdash;like he says he cares&mdash;he'll tell me," she murmured. "I
  don't believe it's wolves. And of course it isn't&mdash;what those fellows
  seemed to think. But&mdash;where did he get the money for all that?" She
  sighed distressfully. "I hate to ask him; he'd think I didn't trust him, and
  I do. I do trust him!" There was the little head-devil of doubt, and she
  fought him fiercely. "I do! I do!" She thrust the declaration of faith like a
  sword through the doubt-devil that clung and whispered. "Dear Ward! I do
  trust you!" She blinked back tears and bit her lips to stop their quivering.
  "But, darn it, I don't see why you didn't tell me!" There it was: a perfectly
  human, woman-resentment toward a nagging mystery.</p>

  <p>She headed Blue down the slope and as straight for the Big Hill as she
  could go. She would go and make Ward tell her what he had been doing; not
  that she had any doubt herself that it was perfectly all right, whatever it
  was, but she felt that she had a right to demand facts, so that she could
  feel more sure of her ground. And there would be more questions; Billy Louise
  was bright enough to see thus far into the future. Unless the rustlers were
  caught, there would be questions asked about this silent stranger who kept
  his trail apart from his fellows and whose prosperity was out of proportion
  with his opportunities. Why, even Billy Louise herself had been curious over
  that prosperity, without being in the slightest degree suspicious. Other
  people had not her faith in him; and they were not blind. They would
  wonder&mdash; There was no trail that way, and the ridges were steep and the
  canyons circuitous. But Blue was a good horse, with plenty of stamina and
  much experience. He carried his lady safely, and he carried her willingly.
  Even her impatience could find no fault with the manner in which he climbed
  steep pitches, slid down slopes as steep, jumped narrow washouts, and picked
  his way through thickets of quaking aspens or over wide stretches of shale
  rock and lava beds. He was wet to his ears when finally he shuffled into
  Ward's trail up the creek bottom; but he breathed evenly, and he carried his
  head high and perked his ears knowingly forward when the corral and haystack
  came into view around a sharp bend.. He splashed both front feet into the
  creek just before the cabin and stopped to drink while Billy Louise stared at
  the silent place.</p>

  <p>By the tracks along the creek trail she knew that Ward had come home, and
  she urged Blue across the ford and up the bank to the cabin. She slid off and
  went in boldly to hide her inward embarrassment&mdash;and she found nothing
  but emptiness there.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise did not take long to investigate. The coffee-pot was still
  warm on the stove when she laid her palm against it, and she immediately
  poured herself a cup of coffee. A plate and a cup on the table indicated that
  Ward had eaten a hurried meal and had not taken time to clear away the
  litter. Billy Louise ate what was left, and mechanically she washed the
  dishes and made everything neat before she went down to look for Rattler. She
  had thought that Ward was out somewhere about the place and would return very
  soon, probably. Blue she had left standing in plain sight before the cabin,
  so that Ward would see him and know she was there&mdash;a fact which she
  regretted.</p>

  <p>While she was washing dishes and sweeping, she had been trying to think of
  some excuse for her presence there. It was going to be awkward, her coming
  there on his heels, one might say. She remembered for the first time her
  statement that she had to help mommie and so could not take the time to ride
  even a mile with him! Being a young person whose chief amusement had always
  been her "pretends," she began unconsciously building an imaginary
  conversation between them, like this: Ward would come out of the
  stable&mdash;or somewhere&mdash;see Blue and hurry up to the house. Billy
  Louise would be standing with her back to him, putting the dishes into neat
  little piles in the cupboard perhaps; anyway, doing something like that. Ward
  would stop in the doorway and say&mdash;well, there were several possible
  greetings, but Billy Louise chose his "'Lo, Bill!" as being the most
  probable. And then he would come up and take her in his arms. (Oh, she was
  human, and she was a woman, and she was twenty. And Ward had established a
  precedent, remember, and Billy Louise had not objected to any great extent.)
  And&mdash;and&mdash;(I'm going to tell on Billy Louise. She wiped a knife for
  at least five minutes without knowing what she was doing, and she stared at a
  sunny spot on the floor where a sunbeam came in through a crack in the wall,
  and she smiled absently, and her cheeks were quite a bit redder than usual.)
  "I didn't expect to see you here, Wilhemina-mine."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I was just riding around, and I came over to see how you dig dollars
  out of wolf-dens. You said you'd show me."</p>

  <p>The trouble with the conversation began right there. Ward would be sure to
  remind her of the condition he had made, to tell her how he dug dollars out
  of wolf-dens when she was through with wanting to be just friends. That put
  it up to Billy Louise to say she would be engaged and marry him; and Billy
  Louise was not ready to say that or be that. Her woman-soul hung back from
  that decisive point. She would not shut the door upon her freedom and her
  girlish dreams and her ideals and all those evanescent bubbles which we try
  to carry with us into maturity. Billy Louise did not put it that way, of
  course. She only reiterated again and again: "I like you, but I don't want to
  marry anybody. I don't want to be engaged."</p>

  <p>Well, that would probably settle Ward's telling her about digging dollars
  out of wolf-dens or anything else. He had a wide streak of stubbornness; no
  one could see the set of his chin when he was in a certain mood and doubt
  that. Billy Louise began to wish she had not come. She began to feel quite
  certain that Ward would be surprised and disgusted when he found her there,
  and would look at her with that faint curl of the lip and that fainter lift
  of the nostril above it, which made her go hot all over with the scorn in
  them. She had seen him look that way once or twice, and in spite of herself
  she began to picture his face with that expression.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise was on the point of riding away a good deal more hastily than
  she had come, in the hope that Ward would not discover her there. Then her
  own stubbornness came uppermost, and she told herself that she had a perfect
  right to ride wherever she pleased, and that if Ward didn't like it, he could
  do the other thing.</p>

  <p>She went to the door and stood looking out for a minute, wondering where
  he was. She turned back and stared around the room, which somehow held the
  imprint of his personality in spite of its rough simplicity.</p>

  <p>There was a little window behind the bunk, and beside that a shelf filled
  with books and smoking material and matches. She knew by the very arrangement
  of that shelf and window that Ward liked to lie there on the bunk and read
  while the light lasted. Well, he was not there now, at any rate. She went
  over and looked at the titles of the books, though she had examined them with
  interest only yesterday. There was Burns; and she knew why it was he could
  repeat <i>Tam O'Shanter</i> so readily with never a moment's hesitation.
  There were two volumes of Scott&mdash;<i>Lady of the Lake</i> and other
  poems, much thumbed and with a cigarette burn on the front cover, and
  <i>Kenilworth</i>. There were several books of Kipling's, mostly verses, and
  beside it Morgan's <i>Ancient Society</i>, with the corners broken, and a
  fine-print volume of Shakespeare's plays. Then there was a pile of magazines
  and beyond them a stack of books whose subjects varied from Balzac to
  strange, scientific-sounding names. At the other end of the shelf, within
  easy reach from one lying upon the bunk, was a cigar-box full of smoking
  tobacco, a half-dozen books of cigarette papers, and several blocks of the
  small, evil-smelling matches which men of the outdoors carry for their
  compact form and slow, steady blaze.</p>

  <p>At the head of the bed hung a flour-sack half full of some hard, lumpy
  stuff which Billy Louise had not noticed before. She felt the bag
  tentatively, could not guess its contents, and finally took it down and
  untied it. Within were irregular scraps and strips of stuff hard as
  bone&mdash;a puzzle still to one unfamiliar with the frontier. Billy Louise
  pulled out a little piece, nibbled a corner, and pronounced, "M-mm! Jerky!
  I'm going to swipe some of that," which she proceeded to do, to the extent of
  filling her pocket. For to those who have learned to like it, jerked venison
  is quite as desirable as milk chocolate or any other nibbly tid-bit.</p>

  <p>The opposite wall had sacks of flour stacked against it, and boxes of
  staple canned goods, such as corn and tomatoes and milk and peaches. A box of
  canned peaches stood at the head of the bed, and upon that a case of
  tomatoes. Ward used them for a table and set the lantern there when he wanted
  to read in bed. "He's got a pretty good supply of grub," was the verdict of
  Billy Louise, sizing up the assortment while she nibbled at the piece of
  jerky. "I wonder where he is, anyway?" And a moment later: "He oughtn't to
  hang his best clothes up like that; they'll be all wrinkled when he wants to
  put them on."</p>

  <p>She went over and disposed of the best clothes to her liking, and shook
  out the dust. She had to own to herself that for a bachelor Ward was very
  orderly, though he did let his trousers hang down over the flour-sacks in a
  way to whiten their hems. She hung them in a different place.</p>

  <p>But where was Ward? Billy Louise bethought her that Blue deserved
  something to eat after that hard ride, and led him down to the stable. There
  was no sign of Rattler, and Billy Louise wondered anew at Ward's absence. It
  did not seem consistent with his haste to leave the Wolverine and his
  frequent assertion that he must get to work. From the stable door she could
  look over practically the whole creek-bottom within his fence, and she could
  see the broad sweep of the hills on either side. On her way back to the
  cabin, she tried to track Rattler, but there were several stock-trails
  leading in different directions, and the soil was too dry to leave any
  distinguishing marks.</p>

  <p>She waited for an hour or two, sitting in the door-way, nibbling jerky and
  trying to read a magazine. Then she found a stub of pencil, tore out an
  advertising page which had a wide margin, wrote: "I don't think you're a bit
  nice. Why don't you stay home when a fellow comes to see you?" This she
  folded neatly and put in the cigar-box of tobacco over Ward's pillow. It
  never once occurred to her that Ward, when he found the note, would believe
  she had placed it there the day before, and would never guess by its text
  that she had made a second trip to his claim.</p>

  <p>She resaddled Blue and rode away more depressed than ever, because her
  depression was now mixed with a disappointment keener than she would have
  cared to acknowledge, even to herself.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE CORRAL IN THE CANYON</h2>

  <p class="first">WHERE the creek trail crossed the Big Hill and then swung to
  the left that it might follow the easy slopes of Cedar Creek, Blue turned off
  to the right of his own accord, as if he took it for granted that his lady
  would return the way she had come. His lady had not thought anything about
  it, but after a brief hesitation she decided that Blue should have his way;
  after all, it would simplify her explanations of the long ride if she came
  home by way of the canyon. She could say that she had ridden farther out into
  the hills than usual, which was true enough.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise did not own such a breeder of blues as a lazy liver, her
  nerves were in fine working order, and her digestion was perfect; and it is a
  well-known fact that a trouble must be born of reality rather than
  imagination, if it would ride far behind the cantle. Billy Louise was late,
  and already the shadows lay like long draperies upon the hills she faced:
  long, purple cloaks ruffed with golden yellow and patterned with indigo
  patches, which were the pines, and splotches of dark green, which were the
  thickets of alder and quaking aspens. She couldn't feel depressed for very
  long, and before she had climbed over the first rugged ridge that reached out
  like a crooked finger into the narrow valley, she was humming under her
  breath and riding with the reins dropped loose upon Blue's neck, so that he
  went where the way pleased him best. Before she was down that ridge and
  beginning to climb the next, she was singing softly a song her mother had
  taught her long ago, when she was seven or so:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"The years creep slowly by, Lorena,<br>
  The snow is on the grass again;<br>
  The sun's low down the sky, Lorena&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>Blue gathered himself together and jumped a washout three feet across and
  goodness knows how deep and jarred that melancholy melody quite out of Billy
  Louise's mind. When she had settled herself again to the slow climb, she
  broke out with what she called Ward's Come-all-ye, and with a twinkle of eye
  and both dimples showing deep, went on with a very slight interruption in her
  singing.</p>

  <p>"'Oh, a ten-dollar hoss and a forty-dollar saddle'&mdash;that's you Blue.
  You don't amount to nothing nohow, doing jackrabbit stunts like that when I'm
  not looking! 'Coma ti yi youpy, youpy-a.'" She watched a cloud shadow sweep
  like a great bird over a sunny slope and murmured while she watched:
  "Cloud-boats sailing sunny seas&mdash;is that original, or have I cribbed it
  from some honest-to-goodness poet? Blue, if fate hadn't made a cowpuncher of
  me, I'd be chewing up lead-pencils trying to find a rhyme for alfalfa, maybe.
  And where would you be, you old skate? If the Louise of me had been developed
  at the expense of the Billy of me, and I'd taken to making battenburg doilies
  with butterflies in the corners, and embroidering corset covers till I put my
  eyes out, and writing poetry on Sundays when mommie wouldn't let me sew. I
  wonder if Ward&mdash; Maybe he'd have liked me better if I'd lived up to the
  Louise and cut out the Billy part. I'd be home, right now, asking mommie
  whether I should use soda or baking-powder to make my muffins with&mdash; Oh,
  gracious!" She leaned over and caught a handful of Blue's slatey mane and
  tousled it, till he laid his ears flat on his head and nipped his nose around
  to show her that his teeth were bared to the gums. Billy Louise laughed and
  gave another yank.</p>

  <p>"You wish I were an embroidering young lady, do you? Aw, where would you
  be, if you didn't have me to devil the life out of you? Well, why don't you
  take a chunk out of me, then? Don't be an old bluffer, Blue. If you want to
  eat me, why, go to it; only you don't. You're just a-bluffing. You like to be
  tousled and you know it; else why do you tag me all over the place when I
  don't want you? Huh? That's to pay you back for jumping that washout when I
  wasn't looking." A twitch of the mane here brought Blue's head around again
  with all his teeth showing. "And this is for jarring that lovely, weepy song
  out of me. You know you hate it; you always do lay back your ears when I sing
  that, but&mdash;oh, all right&mdash;when I sing, then. But you've got to
  stand for it. I've been an indigo bag all day long, and I'm going to sing if
  I want to. Fate made me a lady cowpunch instead of a poet-ess, and you can't
  stop me from singing when I feel it in my system."</p>

  <p>She began again with the "Ten-dollar hoss and forty-dollar saddle," and
  sang as much of the old trail song as she had ever heard and could remember,
  substituting milder expletives now and then and laughing at herself for doing
  it, because a self-confessed "lady cowpunch" is after all hedged about by
  certain limitations in the matter of both speech and conduct. She did not
  sing it all, but she sang enough to last over a mile of rough going, and she
  did not have to repeat many verses to do it.</p>

  <p>Blue, because she still left the reins loose, chose his own trail, which
  was easier than that which they had taken in the forenoon, but more
  roundabout. Billy Louise, observing how he avoided rocky patches and went
  considerably out of his way to keep his feet on soft soil, stopped in the
  middle of a "Coma ti yi" to ask him solicitously if he were getting
  tender-footed; and promised him a few days off, in the pasture. Thereafter
  she encouraged the roundabout progress, even though she knew it would keep
  them in the hills until dusk; for she was foolishly careful of Blue, however
  much she might tease him and call him names.</p>

  <p>Quite suddenly, just at sundown, her cheerful journeying was interrupted
  in a most unexpected manner. She was dreaming along a flat-bottomed canyon,
  looking for an easy way across, when Blue threw up his head, listened with
  his ears thrust forward, and sniffed with widened nostrils. From his manner,
  almost anything might lie ahead of them. And because certain of the
  possibilities would call for quick action if any of them became a certainty,
  Billy Louise twisted her gun-belt around so that her six-shooter swung within
  easy reach of her hand. With her fingers she made sure that the gun was loose
  in its holster and kicked Blue mildly as a hint to go on and see what it was
  all about.</p>

  <p>Blue went forward, stepping easily on the soft sidehill. In rough country,
  whatever you want to see is nearly always around a sharp bend; you read it so
  in the stories and books of travels, and when you ride out in the hills, you
  find it so in reality. Billy Louise rode for three or four minutes before she
  received any inkling of what lay ahead, though Blue's behavior during that
  interval had served to reassure her somewhat. He was interested still in what
  lay just out of sight beyond a shoulder of the hill, but he did not appear to
  be in the least alarmed. Therefore, Billy Louise knew it couldn't be a bear,
  at any rate.</p>

  <p>They came to the point of the hill's shoulder, and Billy Louise tightened
  the reins instinctively while she stared at what lay revealed beneath. The
  head of the gulch was blocked with a corral&mdash;small, high, hidden from
  view on all sides save where she stood, by the jagged walls of rock and heavy
  aspen thickets beyond.</p>

  <p>The corral was but the setting for what Billy Louise stared at so
  unbelievingly. A horseman had ridden out of the corral just as she came into
  sight, had turned a sharp corner, and had disappeared by riding up the same
  slope she occupied, but farther along, and in a shallow depression which hid
  him completely after that one brief glimpse.</p>

  <p>Of course, the gulch was dusky with deep shadows, and she had had only a
  glimpse. But the horse was a dark bay, and the rider was slim and tall and
  wore a gray hat. The heart of Billy Louise paused a moment from its steady
  beating and then sank heavily under a great weight. She was range-born and
  range-bred. She had sat wide-eyed on her daddy's knees and heard him tell of
  losses in cattle and horses and of corrals found hidden away in strange
  places and of unknown riders who disappeared mysteriously into the hills. She
  had heard of these things; they were a part of the stage setting for wild
  dramas of the West.</p>

  <p>With a white line showing around her close-pressed lips and a horror in
  her wide-eyed glance, she rode quietly along the side of the bluff toward
  where she had seen the horseman disappear. He was riding a dark bay, and he
  wore a gray hat and dark coat, and he was slim and tall. Billy Louise made a
  sound that was close to a groan and set her teeth hard together
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>She reached the hillside just above the corral. There were cattle down
  there, moving uneasily about in the shadows. Of the horseman there was of
  course no sign; just the corral, and a few restless cattle shut inside, and
  on the hilltops a soft, rose-violet glow, and in the sky beyond a blend of
  purple and deep crimson to show where the sun had been. Close beside her as
  she stood looking down a little, gray bird twittered wistfully.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise took a deep breath and rode on, angling slightly up the
  bluff, so that she could cross at the head of the gulch. It was very quiet,
  very peaceful, and wildly beautiful, this jumble of hills and deep-gashed
  canyons. But Billy Louise felt as though something precious had died. She
  should have gone down and investigated and turned those cattle loose; that
  is, if she dared. Well, she dared; it was not fear that held her to the upper
  slopes. She did not want to know what brand they bore or whether an iron had
  seared fresh marks.</p>

  <p>"Oh, God!" she said once aloud; and there was a prayer and a protest, a
  curse and a question all in those two words.</p>

  <p>So trouble&mdash;trouble that sickened her very soul and choked her into
  dumbness and squeezed her heart so that the ache of it was agony&mdash;came
  and rode with her through the brooding dusk of the canyons and over the
  brighter hilltops.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise did not remember anything much about that ride, except that
  she was glad the way was long. Blue carried her steadily on and on and needed
  no guiding, and though Wolverine canyon was black dark in most places, she
  liked it so.</p>

  <p>John Pringle was standing by the gate waiting for her, which was unusual,
  if Billy Louise had been normal enough to notice it. He came forward and took
  Blue by the bridle when she dismounted, which was still more unusual, for
  Billy Louise always cared for her own horse both from habit and
  preference.</p>

  <p>"Yor mommie, she's sick," he announced stolidly. "She's worry you maybe
  hurt yoreself. Yo better go, maybe."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise did not answer, but ran up the path to the cabin. "Oh, has
  everything got to happen all at once?" she cried aloud, protesting against
  the implacableness of misfortune.</p>

  <p>"Yor mommie's sick," Phoebe announced in a whisper. "She's crazy 'cause
  you been so long. She's awful bad, I guess."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise said nothing, but went in where her mother lay moaning, her
  face white and turned to the ceiling. Billy Louise herself had pulled up her
  reserves of strength and cheerfulness, and the fingers she laid on her
  mother's forehead were cool and steady.</p>

  <p>"Poor old mommie! Is it that nasty lumbago again?" she asked caressingly
  and did not permit the tiniest shade of anxiety to spoil the reassurance of
  her presence. "I went farther than usual, and Blue's pretty tender, so I
  eased him along, and I'm fearfully late. I suppose you've been having all
  kinds of disasters happening to me." She was passing her fingers soothingly
  over her mother's forehead while she explained, and she saw that her mother
  did not moan so much as when she came into the room.</p>

  <p>"Of course I worried. I wish you wouldn't take them long rides. Oh, I
  guess it's lumbago&mdash;mostly&mdash;but seems like it ain't, either. The
  pain seems to be mostly in my side." She stirred restlessly and moaned
  again.</p>

  <p>"What's Phoebe been doing for it? You don't seem to have any fever,
  mommie&mdash;and that's a good thing. I'll go fix you one of those dandy
  spice poultices. Had any supper, mommie?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I couldn't eat. Phoebe made a hop poultice, but it's awful
  soppy."</p>

  <p>"Well, never mind. Your dear daughter is on the job now. She'll have you
  all comfy in just about two minutes. Head ache, mum? All right. I'll just
  shake up your pilly and bring you such a dandy spice poultice I expect you'll
  want to eat it!" Billy Louise's voice was soft and had a broody sweetness
  when she wished it so, that soothed more than medicine. Her mother's eyes
  closed wearily while the girl talked; the muscles of her face relaxed a
  little from their look of pain.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise bent and laid her lips lightly on her mother's cheek. "Poor
  old mommie! I'd have come home a-running if I'd known she was sick and had to
  have nasty, soppy stuff."</p>

  <p>In the kitchen a very different Billy Louise measured spices, and asked a
  question now and then in a whisper, and breathed with a repressed unevenness
  which betrayed the strain she was under.</p>

  <p>"Tell John to saddle up and go for the doctor, Phoebe, and don't let
  mommie know, whatever you do. This isn't her lumbago at all. I don't know
  what it is. I wonder if a hot turpentine cloth wouldn't be better than this?
  I've a good mind to try it; her eyes are glassy with fever, and her skin is
  cold as a fish. You tell John to hurry up. He can ride Boxer. Tell him I want
  him to get a doctor here by to-morrow noon if he has to kill his horse doing
  it."</p>

  <p>"Is she that bad?" Phoebe's black eyes glistened with consternation.
  "She's groaned all day and shook her head like this all time."</p>

  <p>"Oh, stop looking like that! No wonder she's sick, if you've stood over
  her with that kind of a face on you. You look as if someone were dead in the
  house!"</p>

  <p>"I'm skeered of sick folks. Honest, it gives me shivers."</p>

  <p>"Well, keep out then. Make some fresh tea, Phoebe&mdash;or no, make some
  good, strong coffee. I'll need it, if I'm up all night. Make it strong,
  Phoebe. Hurry, and&mdash;" She stopped short and ran into the bedroom, called
  there by her mother's cry of pain.</p>

  <p>That night took its toll of Billy Louise and left a seared place in her
  memory. It was a night of snapping fire in the cook-stove that hot water
  might be always ready; of tireless struggle with the pain that came and
  tortured, retired sullenly from Billy Louise's stubborn fighting with
  poultices and turpentine cloths and every homely remedy she had ever heard
  of, and came again just when she thought she had won the fight.</p>

  <p>There was no time to give thought to the trouble that had ridden home with
  her, though its presence was like a black shadow behind her while she worked
  and went to and fro between bedroom and kitchen, and fought that tearing
  pain.</p>

  <p>She met the dawn hollow-eyed and so tired she could not worry very much
  about anything. Her mother slept uneasily to prove that the battle had not
  gone altogether against the girl who had fought the night through. She had
  her reward in full measure when the doctor came, in the heat of noon, and
  after terrible minutes of suspense for Billy Louise while he counted pulse
  and took temperature and studied symptoms, told her that she had done well,
  and that she and her homely poultices had held back tragedy from that
  house.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise lay down upon the couch out on the back porch and slept
  heavily for three hours, while Phoebe and the doctor watched over her
  mother.</p>

  <p>She woke with a start. She had been dreaming, and the dream had taken from
  her cheeks what little color her night vigil had left. She had dreamed that
  Ward was in danger, that men were hunting him for what he had done at that
  corral. The corral seemed the center of a fight between Ward and the men. She
  dreamed that he came to her, and that she must hide him away and save him.
  But though she took him to Minervy's cave, which was secret enough for her
  purpose, yet she could not feel that he was safe, even there. There was
  something&mdash;some menace.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise went softly into the house, tiptoed to the door of her
  mother's room, and saw that she lay quiet, with her eyes closed. Beside the
  window the doctor sat with his spectacles far down toward the end of his
  nose, reading a pale-green pamphlet that he must have brought in his pocket.
  Phoebe was down by the creek, washing clothes in the shade of a
  willow-clump.</p>

  <p>She went into her own room, still walking on her toes. In her trunk was a
  blue plush box of the kind that is given to one at Christmas. It was faded,
  and the clasp was showing brassy at the edges. Sitting upon her bed with the
  box in her lap, Billy Louise pawed hastily in the jumble of keepsakes it
  held: an eagle's claw which she meant sometime to have mounted for a brooch;
  three or four arrowheads of the shiny, black stuff which the Indians were
  said to have brought from Yellowstone Park, a knot of green ribbon which she
  had worn to a St. Patrick's Day dance in Boise; rattlesnake rattles of all
  sizes; several folded clippings&mdash;verses that had caught her fancy and
  had been put away and forgotten; an amber bead she had found once. She turned
  the box upside down in her lap and shook it. It must be there&mdash;the thing
  she sought; the thing that had troubled her most in her dream; the thing that
  was a menace while it existed. It was at the very bottom of the box, caught
  in a corner. She took it out with fingers that trembled, crumpled it into a
  little ball so that she could not read what it said, straightened it
  immediately, and read it reluctantly from the beginning to the end where the
  last word was clipped short with hasty scissors. A paragraph cut from a
  newspaper, it was; yellow and frayed from contact with other objects, telling
  of things&mdash; Billy Louise bit her lips until they hurt, but she could not
  keep back the tears that came hot and stinging while she read. She slid the
  little heap of odds and ends to the middle of the bed, crushed the clipping
  into her palm, and went out stealthily into the immaculate kitchen. As if she
  were being spied upon, she went cautiously to the stove, lifted a lid, and
  dropped the clipping in where the wood blazed the brightest. She watched it
  flare and become nothing&mdash;not even a pinch of ashes; the clipping was
  not very large. When it was gone, she put the lid back and went tiptoeing to
  the door. Then she ran.</p>

  <p>Phoebe was down by the creek, so Billy Louise went to the stable, through
  that and on beyond, still running. Farther down was a grassy nook&mdash;on,
  beyond the road. She went there and hid behind the willows, where she could
  cry and no one be the wiser. But she could not cry the ache out of her heart,
  nor the rebellion against the hurt that life had given her. If she could only
  have burned memory when she burned that clipping! She could still believe and
  be happy, if only she could forget the things it said.</p>

  <p>Phoebe called her, after a long while had passed. Billy Louise bathed her
  face in the cold water of the Wolverine, used her handkerchief for a towel,
  and went back to take up the duties life had laid upon her. The doctor's team
  was hitched to the light buggy he drove, and the doctor was standing in the
  doorway with his square medicine-case in his hand, waiting to give her a few
  final directions before he left.</p>

  <p>He was like so many doctors; he seemed to be afraid to tell the whole
  truth about his patient. He stuck to evasive optimism and then neutralized
  the reassurances he uttered by emphasizing the necessity of being notified if
  Mrs. MacDonald showed any symptoms of another attack.</p>

  <p>"Don't wait," he told Billy Louise gravely. "Send for me at once if she
  complains of that pain again, or appears&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what is it?" Billy Louise would not be put off by any vagueness.</p>

  <p>The doctor told Billy Louise in terms that carried no meaning whatever to
  her mind. She gathered merely that it was rather serious if it
  persisted&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;and that she must not leave her mommie
  for many hours at a time, because she might have another attack at any time.
  The doctor told her, however, in plain English that mommie was well over this
  attack&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;and that she need only be kept quiet for a
  few days and given the medicine&mdash;whatever that was&mdash;that he had
  left.</p>

  <p>"It does seem as if everything is all muffled up in mystery!" she
  complained, when he drove away. "I can fight anything I can see, but when
  I've got to go blindfolded&mdash;" She brushed her fingers across her eyes
  and glanced hurriedly into the little looking-glass that hung beside the
  door. "Yes, mommie, just a minute," she called cheerfully.</p>

  <p>She ran into her own room, grabbed a can of talcum, and did not wait to
  see whether she applied it evenly to her telltale eyelids, but dabbed at them
  on the way to her mother's room.</p>

  <p>"Doctor says you're all right, mommie; only you mustn't go digging
  post-holes or shoveling hay for awhile."</p>

  <p>"No, I guess not!" Her mother responded unconsciously to the stimulation
  of Billy Louise's tone. "I couldn't dig holes with a teaspoon, I'm that weak
  and useless. Did he say what it was, Billy Louise?" The sick are always so
  curious about their illnesses! "Oh, your lumbago got to scrapping with your
  liver. I forget the name he gave it, but it's nothing to worry about." Billy
  Louise had imagination, remember.</p>

  <p>"I guess he'd think it was something to worry about, if he had it," her
  mother retorted fretfully, but reassured nevertheless by the casual manner of
  Billy Louise. "I believe I could eat a little mite of toast and drink some
  tea," she added tentatively.</p>

  <p>"And an egg poached soft if you want it, mom. Phoebe just brought in the
  eggs." Billy Louise went out humming unconcernedly under her breath as if she
  had not a care beyond the proper toasting of the bread and brewing of the
  tea.</p>

  <p>One need not go to war or voyage to the far corners of the earth to find
  the stuff heroes are made of.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; EACH IN HIS OWN TRAIL</h2>

  <p class="first">SINCE nothing in this world is absolutely
  immutable&mdash;the human emotions least of all, perhaps&mdash;Billy Louise
  did not hold changeless her broken faith in Ward. She saw it broken into
  fragments before the evidence of her own eyes, and the fragments ground to
  dust beneath the weight of what she knew of his past&mdash;things he had told
  her himself. So she thought there was no more faith in him, and her heart
  went empty and aching through the next few days.</p>

  <p>But, since Billy Louise was human, and a woman&mdash;not altogether
  because she was twenty!&mdash;she stopped, after awhile, gathered carefully
  the dust of her dead faith, and, like God, she began to create. First she
  fashioned doubts of her doubt. How did she know she had not made a mistake,
  there at that corral? Other men wore gray hats and rode dark bay horses;
  other men were slim and tall&mdash;and she had only had a glimpse after all,
  and the light was deceptive down there in the shadows. When that first doubt
  was molded, and she had breathed into it the breath of life so that it stood
  sturdily before her, she took heart and created reasons, a whole company of
  them, to tell her why she ought to give Ward the benefit of the doubt. She
  remembered what Charlie Fox had said about circumstantial evidence. She would
  not make the mistake he had made.</p>

  <p>So she spent other days and long, wakeful nights. And since it seemed
  impossible to bring her faith to life again just as it had been, with the
  glamor of romance and the sweetness of pity and the strength of her own
  innocence to make it a beautiful faith indeed, she used all her innocence and
  all her pity and a little of romance and created something even sweeter than
  her untried faith had been. She had a new element to strengthen it. She knew
  that she loved Ward; she had learned that from the hurt it had given her to
  lose her faith in him.</p>

  <p>That was the record of the inner Billy Louise which no one ever saw. The
  Billy Louise which her little world knew went her way unchanged, except in
  small details that escaped the notice of those nearest her. A look in her
  eyes, for one thing; a hurt, questioning look that was sometimes rebellious
  as well; a droop of her mouth, also, when she was off her guard; a sad, tired
  little droop that told of the weight of responsibility and worry she was
  carrying.</p>

  <p>Ward observed both, the minute he saw her on the trail. He had come across
  country on the chance that she might be riding out that way, and he had come
  upon her unawares while she and Blue were staring out over the desert from
  the height they had attained in the hills.</p>

  <p>"'Lo, Bill!" he said, when he was quite close, and held himself ready to
  meet whatever mood she might present.</p>

  <p>She turned her head quickly and looked at him, and the hurt look was still
  in her eyes, the droop still showed at her lips. And Ward knew they had been
  there before she saw him.</p>

  <p>"Wha's molla, Bill?" he asked, in the tone that was calculated to invite
  an unburdening of her troubles.</p>

  <p>"Ob, nothing in particular. Mommie's been awfully sick, and I'm always
  worried when I'm away from the ranch, for fear she'll have another spell
  while I'm gone. The doctor said she might have, any time. Were you headed for
  our place? If you are, come on; I was just starting back. I don't dare be
  away any longer." If that were a real unburdening, Ward was an unreasonable
  young man. Billy Louise looked at him again, and this time her eyes were
  clear and friendly.</p>

  <p>Ward was not satisfied, for all the surface seemed smooth enough. He was
  too sensitive not to feel a difference, and he was too innocent of any
  wrongdoing or thinking to guess what was the matter. Guilt is a good
  barometer of personal atmosphere, and Ward had none of it. The worst of him
  she had known for more than a year; he had told her himself, and she had
  healed the hurt&mdash;almost&mdash;of the past by her firm belief in him and
  by her friendship. Could you expect Ward to guess that she had seen her faith
  in him die a violent death no longer than two weeks ago? Such a possibility
  never occurred to him.</p>

  <p>For all that, he felt there was a difference somewhere. It chilled his
  eagerness a little, and it blanketed his enthusiasm so that he did not tell
  her the things he had meant to tell. He had ridden over with another nugget
  in his pocket&mdash;a nugget the size of an almond. He had come to give it to
  Billy Louise and to tell her how and where he had found it.</p>

  <p>It is too bad that he changed his mind again and kept that lump of gold in
  his pocket. It would have explained so much, if he had given it to Billy
  Louise to put in her blue plush treasure box. It would even have brought to
  life that first faith in him. She might have told him&mdash;one never can
  foresee the lengths to which a woman's confessional mood will carry
  her&mdash;about that corral hidden in the canyon, and of her sickening
  certainty that she had seen him ride stealthily away from it. If she had, he
  would have convinced her that she was mistaken, and that he had that
  afternoon been washing gold a good ten miles from there, until it was too
  dark for him to work.</p>

  <p>He took the nugget back home, and he took it sooner than he had intended
  to return. He also carried back a fit of the blues which seemed to have
  attacked him without cause or pretext, since he had not quarreled with Billy
  Louise, and had been warmly welcomed by "mommie." Poor mommie was looking
  white and frail, and her temples were too distinctly veined with purple. Ward
  told himself that it was no wonder his Wilhemina acted strained and
  unnatural. He meant to work harder than ever and get his stake so that he
  could go and make her give him the right to take care of her.</p>

  <p>He began to figure the cost of commuting his homestead right away, so that
  he would not have to "hold it down" for another three years. Maybe she would
  not want to bring her mother so far off the main road. In that case, he would
  go down and put that Wolverine place in shape. He had no squeamishness about
  living on her ranch instead of his own, if she wanted it that way. He meant
  to be better "hooked up" financially than she was and have more cattle, when
  he put the gold ring on her finger. Then he would do whatever she wanted him
  to do, and he would not have to crucify his pride doing it.</p>

  <p>You see, they could not have quarreled, since Ward carried castles as well
  as the blues. In fact, their parting had given Ward an uneven pulse for a
  mile, for Billy Louise had gone with him as usual as far as the corral, when
  he started home. And when Ward had picked up his reins and turned to put his
  toe in the stirrup, Billy Louise had come close&mdash;to his very shoulder.
  Ward had turned his face toward her, and Billy Louise&mdash;Billy Louise had
  impulsively taken his head between her two hands, had looked deep into his
  eyes, and then had kissed him wistfully on the lips. Then she had turned and
  fled up the path, waving him away up the trail. And though Ward never guessed
  that to her that kiss was a penitent vow of loyalty to their friendship and a
  slap in the face of the doubt-devils that still pursued her weaker moments,
  it set him planning harder than ever for that stake he must win before he
  dared urge her further toward matrimony.</p>

  <p>It's a wonder that the kiss did not wipe out completely the somber mood
  that held him. That it did not, but served merely to tangle his thoughts in a
  most hopeless manner, perhaps proves how greatly the inner life of Billy
  Louise had changed her in those two weeks.</p>

  <p>She changed still more in the next two months, however. There was the
  strain of her mother's precarious health which kept Billy Louise always on
  the alert and always trying to hide her fears. She must be quick to detect
  the first symptoms of a return attack of the illness, and she must not let
  her mother suspect that there was danger of a return. That much the doctor
  had made plain to her.</p>

  <p>Besides that, there was an undercurrent of gossip and rumors of cattle
  stealing, whenever a man stopped at the ranch. It worried Billy Louise, in
  spite of her rebuilt belief in Ward. Doubt would seize her sometimes in spite
  of herself, and she did not see Ward often enough to let his personality
  fight those doubts. She saw him just once in the next two months, and then
  only for an hour or so.</p>

  <p>A man rode up one night and stayed with them until morning, after the
  open-handed custom of the range-land. Billy Louise did not talk with him very
  much. He had shifty eyes and a coarse, loose-lipped mouth and a thick neck,
  and, girl-like, she took a violent dislike to him. But John Pringle told her
  afterwards that he was Buck Olney, the new stock inspector, and that he was
  prowling around to see if he could find out anything.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise worried a good deal, after that. Once she rode out early with
  the intention of going to Ward's claim to warn him. But three miles of saner
  thought changed her purpose: she dared not leave her mother all day, for one
  thing; and for another, she could scarcely warn Ward without letting him see
  that she felt he needed warning; and even Billy Louise shrank from what might
  follow.</p>

  <p>The stock inspector stopped again, on his way back to the railroad. Billy
  Louise was so anxious that she smothered her dislike and treated him nicely,
  which thawed the man to an alarming amiability. She questioned him
  artfully&mdash;trust Billy Louise for that!&mdash;and she decided that the
  stock inspector was either a very poor detective or a very good actor. He did
  not, for instance, mention any corral hidden in a blind canyon away back in
  the hills, and Billy Louise did not mention it, either. He had not found any
  worked brands, he said. And he did not appear to know anything further about
  Ward than the mere fact of his existence.</p>

  <p>"There's a fellow holding down a claim, away over on Mill Creek," he had
  remarked. "I'll look him up when I come back, though Seabeck says he's all
  right."</p>

  <p>"Ward is all right," asserted Billy Louise, rather unwisely.</p>

  <p>"Haven't a doubt of it. I thought maybe he might have seen something that
  might give us a clew." Perhaps the stock inspector was wiser than she gave
  him credit for being. He did not at any rate pursue the subject any farther,
  until he found an opportunity to talk to Mrs. MacDonald herself. Then he
  artfully mentioned the fellow on Mill Creek, and because she did not know any
  reason for caution, he got all the information he wanted, and more, for
  mommie was in one of her garrulous humors.</p>

  <p>He went away in a thoughtful mood, and I may as well tell you why. Do you
  remember that evening when Ward sat before the fire thinking so intently of a
  man that he pulled a gun on Billy Louise when she startled him? Well, this
  stock inspector was the man. And this man went away from the Wolverine
  thinking of Ward quite as intently as Ward sometimes thought of him. If Billy
  Louise had thrown a chip and hit the stock inspector on the back of the neck,
  it is very likely that he would have pulled a gun, also. I've an idea that
  Billy Louise might have done something more than throw a chip at him if she
  had known who he was; but she did not know, and she slept the sounder for her
  ignorance.</p>

  <p>After that the days drifted quietly for a month and grew nippier at each
  end and lazier in the middle; which meant that the short summer was over, and
  that fall was getting ready to paint the wooded slopes with her gayest
  colors, and that one must prepare for the siege of winter.</p>

  <p>It was some time in the latter part of September that Billy Louise got up
  in the middle of a frosty night because she heard her mother moaning. That
  was the beginning. She sent John off before daylight for the doctor, and
  before the next night she stood with her lips pressed together and watched
  the doctor count mommie's pulse and take mommie's temperature, and drew in
  her breath hardly when she saw how long he studied the thermometer
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>There was a month or so of going to and fro on her toes and of watching
  the clock with a mind to medicine-giving. There were nights and nights and
  nights when the cabin window winked like a star fallen into the coulee, from
  dusk to red dawn. Ward rode over once, stayed all night, and went home in a
  silent rage because he could not do a thing.</p>

  <p>There was a week of fluctuating hope, and a time when the doctor said
  mommie must go to a hospital&mdash;Boise, since she had friends there. And
  there was a terrible, nerve-racking journey to the railroad. And when Ward
  rode next to the Wolverine ranch, there was no Billy Louise to taunt or tempt
  him. John Pringle and Phoebe told him in brief, stolid sentences of the later
  developments and gave him a meal and offered him a bed, which he
  declined.</p>

  <p>When the suspense became maddening, after that, he would ride down to the
  Wolverine for news. And the news was monotonously scant. Phoebe could read
  and write, after a fashion, and Billy Louise sent her a letter now and then,
  saying that mommie was about the same, and that she wanted John to do certain
  things about the ranch. She could not leave mommie, she said. Ward gathered
  that she would not.</p>

  <p>Once when he was at the ranch, he wrote a letter to Billy Louise, and told
  her that he would come to Boise if there was anything he could do, and begged
  her to let him know if she needed any money. Beyond that he worked and
  worked, and tried to crowd the lonesomeness out of his days and the hunger
  from his dreams, with complete bone-weariness. He did not expect an answer to
  his letter&mdash;at least he told himself that he did not&mdash;but one day
  Phoebe gave him a thin little letter more precious in his eyes than the
  biggest nugget he had found.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise did not write much; she explained that she could only
  scribble a line or two while mommie slept. Mommie was about the same. She did
  not think there was anything Ward could do, and she thanked him for offering
  to help. There was nothing, she said pathetically, that anybody could do;
  even the doctors did not seem able to do much, except tell her lies and
  charge her for them. No, she did not need any money, "thank you just the
  same, Ward." That was about all. It did not sound in the least like Billy
  Louise.</p>

  <p>Ward answered the note then and there, and called her
  Wilhemina-mine&mdash;which was an awkward name to write and cost him five
  minutes of cogitation over the spelling. But he wanted it down on paper where
  she could see it and remember how it sounded when he said it, even if it did
  look queer. Farther along he started to call her Bill Loo, but rubbed it out
  and substituted Lady Girl (with capitals). Altogether he did better than he
  knew, for he made Billy Louise cry when she read it, and he made her say
  "Dear Ward!" under her breath, and remember how his hair waved over his left
  temple, and how he looked when that smile hid just behind his lips and his
  eyes. And he made her forget that she had lost faith in him. She needed to
  cry, and she needed to remember and also to forget some things; for life was
  a hard, dull drab in Boise, with nothing to lighten it, save a vicarious hope
  that did not comfort.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise was not stupid. She saw through the vagueness of the doctors;
  and besides, she was so hungry for her hills that she felt like beating the
  doctors with her fists, because they did nothing to make her mommie well
  enough to go home. She grew to hate the nurse and her neutral
  cheerfulness.</p>

  <p>That is how the fall passed for Billy Louise, and the early part of the
  winter.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; "YOU WON'T GET ME AGAIN"</h2>

  <p class="first">ONE day late in the fall, Ward was riding the hills off to
  the north and west of his claim, looking at the condition of the range there
  and keeping an eye out for Y6 cattle. He had bought another dozen head of
  mixed stock, over toward Hardup, and they were not yet past the point of
  straying off their new range. So, having keen eyes and the incentive to use
  them, he paid attention to stock tracks in the soft places, and he saw
  everything within the sweep of his vision; and, since the day was clear and
  fine, his range of vision, when he reached a high point, extended to the
  Three Buttes away out in the desert.</p>

  <p>By sheer accident he rode up to the canyon where the little corral lay
  hidden at the end, and looked down. And since he rode up at an angle
  different from the one Billy Louise had taken, the corral was directly
  beneath him&mdash;so directly, in fact, that half of it was hidden from
  sight. He saw that there were cattle within it, however, and two men at work
  there. And by chance he lifted his eyes and saw the nose of a horse beyond a
  jutting ledge sixty yards or so away, and the crown of a hat showing just
  above the ledge; a lookout, he judged instantly, and pulled Rattler behind
  the rock he had been at some pains to ride around.</p>

  <p>Ward was a cowpuncher. He knew the tricks of the trade so well that he did
  not wonder what was going on down there. He knew. He was tempted to do as
  Billy Louise had done&mdash;ride on and pass up knowledge which might be
  disagreeable; for Ward was not one to spy upon his fellows, and the man whom
  he would betray into the hands of a sheriff must be guilty of a most heinous
  crime. That was his code: To let every fellow have a chance to work out his
  own salvation or damnation as he might choose. I don't suppose there was
  anything he hated worse than an informer.</p>

  <p>He got behind the rock, since he had no great desire to be shot, and he
  discovered that his view of the corral was much plainer than from where he
  had first seen it. He looked behind him for an easy retreat to the skyline,
  and then before he turned to ride away, he glanced down again curiously.</p>

  <p>A man walked out into the center of the corral and stood there in the
  revealing sunlight. Ward's eyes bored like gimlets through the space that
  divided them. Instinctively his hand went to the gun on his hip. It was a
  long pistol shot, and he was afraid he might miss; for Ward was not a wizard
  with a gun, much as I should like to misrepresent him as a dead shot. He was
  human, just like yourself. He could shoot pretty well, a great deal better
  than lots of men who do more boasting than he ever did, but he frequently
  missed. He measured the distance with his mind while the man stood there
  talking to someone unseen. To look at Ward's face, you would have sworn that
  the man was doomed; but something held Ward's finger from crooking on the
  trigger; the man had his back turned squarely toward the gun. Ward waited.
  The man did not move. He waited another minute, and then he opened his lips
  to shout. And when his lips parted for the call that would bring the fellow
  facing him, Ward's tricky brain snapped before his eyes the face of Billy
  Louise.</p>

  <p>He lowered the gun. He could not shoot when he knew that the bullet would
  split a gulf between himself and the girl&mdash;a gulf that would separate
  him forever from that future where stood his air castles. Billy Louise had
  talked to him very seriously one day about this very possibility. She had
  made him see that shooting this man would be the worst thing he could
  possibly do.</p>

  <p>He let down the hammer with his thumb, slid the gun back into his holster,
  and dismounted, with a glance toward the place where the lookout was
  stationed. He was sure he had not been seen, and so he crouched behind a
  splinter of rock and watched. He had no plan, but his instinct impelled him
  to closely watch Buck Olney.</p>

  <p>Another man came into view, down there in the corral. He also stood
  plainly revealed, and Ward gave a little snort of contemptuous surprise when
  he recognized him. After that he studied the situation with scowling brows.
  This other man either upset his conclusions or complicated his manner of
  dealing with Buck Olney. Ward would not have hesitated one second about
  putting the sheriff on the trail of Buck, but if the second man were
  implicated, he could not betray one without betraying the other. And if the
  business down there in the corral were lawful, then he must think of some
  other means. At any rate, the thing to do now was to make sure.</p>

  <p>The two in the corral came out and closed the gate behind them, and the
  first man kicked apart the embers of a small fire and afterward busied
  himself with the ground&mdash;either looking for tracks or covering them Up.
  They came a little way along the side of the bluff, mounted, and rode up
  toward where the lookout waited. And one of them rode a dark bay, and was
  slim and tall, and wore a gray hat.</p>

  <p>Ward glanced at Rattler standing half asleep with reins dropped to the
  ground. He reached out, took the reins, and led the horse farther down under
  the shelter of the ledge. Rattler pricked up his ears at the sound of those
  other riders, but he did not show enough interest to nicker a greeting; he
  was always a self-centered beast and was content to go his way alone, like
  his master.</p>

  <p>Ward stood up, where he could see the rim of the bluff over the ledge of
  lava rock. He might get a closer view and see who was the look out, and he
  might be seen; for that contingency he kept his fingers close to his gun. He
  heard their scrambling progress. Now and then one of the horses sent a little
  rock bounding down into the canyon, whereat the cattle on the corral moved
  restlessly around the small inclosure.</p>

  <p>They came closer, after they had gained the top. Ward, leaning against the
  dull-gray rock before him, heard the murmur of their voices. Once he caught
  the unmistakable tones of the man he would like to kill. "I'll keep cases and
  git him." Plotting against some poor devil, as usual, Ward thought, and
  wondered if the man knew he lived in this part of the country; if he did, it
  might easily be&mdash; "I'll keep cases some myself, you damned reptile," he
  muttered under his breath. "You won't get me again, if that's what you've got
  in mind."</p>

  <p>They went on, and presently Ward was looking at their backs as they rode
  over the ridge. He stood for some time staring after them with what Billy
  Louise called his gimlet look. He was breathing shortly from the pressure he
  had put upon his self-control, and he was thinking&mdash;thinking.</p>

  <p>The silence came creeping in on the heels of the faint, interrupted sound
  of their voices. Ward took a long breath, discovered that he was gripping his
  gun as though his life depended on hanging to it, and rubbed his numbed
  fingers absently. After a minute or so, he mounted and rode down to the
  corral.</p>

  <p>Five dry cows and two steers snorted at his approach and crowded against
  the farther rails. Ward gave Rattler a touch of the spurs, rode close to the
  fence, and stood in his stirrups while he studied the bunch.</p>

  <p>"Hell!" he said, when the inspection was over, and dropped back into the
  saddle while he gazed unseeingly at the canyon wall. It was a very real hell
  that his mind saw; a hell made by men, wherein other men must dwell in
  torment because of their sins or the sins of their fellows.</p>

  <p>Seabeck's brand was a big V, a bad brand to own, since it favors revision
  at the hands of the unscrupulous. These cattle were Seabeck cattle, and their
  brand had been altered. For the right slant of the V had been extended a
  little and curled into a 6, so that in time the brand would stand casual
  inspection as a Y6 monogram&mdash;Ward's own brand. The work was
  crude&mdash;purposefully crude. The V had not been reburned enough to make it
  look fresh, and the newly seared 6 had been added with a malevolent pressure
  that would make it stand out a fresh brand for a long time&mdash;in case of a
  delay in the proceedings, as Ward knew perfectly well.</p>

  <p>So he sat there and looked over the fence and saw himself a convicted
  "rustler." There was the evidence, all ready to damn him utterly before a
  jury. They would be turned loose on the range near his claim, and they would
  be found before the scabs had haired over. It was a good time for rustling;
  round-ups were over for the winter, and the weather would confine
  range-riding to absolute necessity.</p>

  <p>Of course, the work was coarse&mdash;so coarse as to reflect against his
  intelligence; but when brands are worked over and the culprit has been
  caught, the law is not too careful to give the prisoner credit for
  brains.</p>

  <p>Ward stared at the altered brands and wondered what he had best do. He
  bethought him that perhaps it would be as well to put a little scenery
  between himself and that particular locality, and he started back up the
  hill. Once he pulled up as if he would go back, but he thought better of it.
  It was out of the question to turn those cattle loose. He could not kill them
  and dispose of the bodies&mdash;not when there were seven of them. He might
  go down and blotch the brands so that they would not read anything at all. He
  had thought of that before and decided against it. That would put those three
  on their guard and would probably not benefit him in the long run. They could
  work the brands on other cattle.</p>

  <p>He hunched forward in the saddle and let Rattler choose his own trail up
  the hill. Though he did not know it, trouble had caught Billy Louise in that
  same place, and had sent her forward with drooping shoulders and a mind so
  absorbed that she gave no attention to her horse; but that is merely a
  trifling coincidence. The thing he had to decide was far more complicated
  than Billy Louise's problem.</p>

  <p>Should he go straight to Seabeck and tell him what he had found out? He
  did not know Seabeck, except as he had met him once or twice on the trail and
  exchanged trivial greetings and a few words about the weather. Besides,
  Seabeck would very soon find out&mdash; There it stood at his shoulder,
  grinning at him malevolently&mdash;his past. It tied his hands. Buck Olney he
  could deal with single-handed; for Olney had the fear of him that is born of
  a guilty conscience. He could send Buck "over the road" whenever he chose to
  tell some things he knew; he could do it without any compunctions, too. Buck
  Olney, the stock inspector, deserved no mercy at Ward's hands; and would get
  none, if ever they met where Ward would have a chance at him.</p>

  <p>Olney he could deal with, alone. But with the evidence of those rebranded
  cattle, and the testimony of two men, together with the damning testimony of
  his past! Ward lifted his head and stared heavily at the pine slope before
  him. He could not go to Seabeck and tell him anything. In the black hour of
  that ride, he could not think of anything that he could do that would save
  him.</p>

  <p>And then quite suddenly, in his desperation, he decided upon something. He
  laughed hardly, turned Rattler back from the homeward trail, and returned to
  the corral in the canyon. "They started this game, and they've put it up to
  me," he told himself grimly, "and they needn't squeal if they burn their own
  fingers."</p>

  <p>He hurried, for he had some work ahead of him, and the sun was sliding
  past the noon mark already. He reached the corral and went about what he had
  to do as if he were working for wages and wanted to give good measure.</p>

  <p>First, he rebuilt the little fire just outside the corral where the cattle
  could not trample it, but where one might thrust a branding iron into its
  midst from between the rails. When it was going properly, he searched certain
  likely hiding-places and found an iron still warm from previous service. He
  thrust it in to heat, led Rattler into the corral, and closed the gate
  securely behind him. Then he mounted, took down his rope and widened the
  loop, while his angry eyes singled out the animal he wanted first.</p>

  <p>Ward was not an adept with a "running iron"; he was honest, whatever men
  might say of him. But he knew how to tie down an animal, and he sacrificed
  part of his lariat to get the short rope he needed to tie their feet
  together. He worked fast&mdash;no telling what minute someone might come and
  catch him&mdash;and he did his work well, far better and neater than had his
  predecessors.</p>

  <p>When he left that corral, he smiled. Before he had ridden very far up the
  bluff, he stopped, looked down at the long-suffering cattle, and smiled again
  sardonically. One could read their brands easily from where he sat on his
  horse. They were not blotched; they were very distinct. But they were not Y6s
  within that corral. There were other brands which might be made of a Y6
  monogram, by the judicious addition of a mark here and a mark there.</p>

  <p>"There, damn yuh: chew on that awhile!" he apostrophized the absent three.
  He turned away and rode back once more toward home.</p>

  <p>Rattler turned naturally into the trail which ran up the creek to the
  ranch, but Ward immediately turned him out of it. "We aren't going to
  overlook any bets, old-timer," he said grimly and crossed the creek at a
  point where it was too rocky to leave any hoof-prints behind them. He rode up
  the lower point of the ridge beyond and followed the crest of it on the side
  away from the valley. When he reached a point nearly opposite his cabin, he
  dismounted, unbuckled his spurs, and slipped their chains over the
  saddle-horn. Then he went forward afoot to reconnoitre. He was careful to
  avoid rock or gravelly patches and to walk always on the soft grass which
  muffled his steps.</p>

  <p>In this wise he made his way to the top of the ridge, where he could look
  down upon the cabin and stable and corrals and see also the creek trail for a
  good quarter of a mile. The little valley lay quiet. His team fed undisturbed
  by the creek not far from the corral, which reassured Ward more than
  anything. Still, he waited until he had made reasonably sure that the bluff
  held no watcher concealed before he went back to where Rattler waited
  patiently.</p>

  <p>"I guess they didn't plan to stir things up till they got those critters
  planted where they wanted them," he mused, while he rode down the bluff to
  his cabin. "But when they visit that bunch of stock again, I reckon things
  will begin to tighten!"</p>

  <p>He was wary of exposing himself too much to view from the bluff while he
  did his chores that night, and he kept Rattler in the stable. Also, he slept
  very little, and before daybreak he was up and away. He had a rolled army
  blanket tied behind the saddle, a sack of grub and a frying-pan and a bucket
  for coffee. But he did not go any farther than the wolf-den, and he spent a
  couple of hours removing as well as he could any suspicious traces of having
  dug anything more than wolf pups from the bank on the ledge.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; "I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU OUT AND HANG YOU"</h2>

  <p class="first">THE trouble with a man like Buck Olney is that you can never
  be sure of his method, except that it will be underhand and calculated to
  eliminate as much as possible any risk to himself. Ward, casting back into
  his memory&mdash;he had known Buck Olney very well, once upon a time, and in
  his unsuspecting youth had counted him a friend&mdash;tried to guess how Buck
  would proceed when he went down to that corral and found how those brands had
  been retouched.</p>

  <p>"He'll be running around in circles for awhile, all right," he deduced
  with an air of certainty. "Blotched brands he'd know was my work; and he
  could have put it on me, too, with a good yarn about trailing me so close I
  got cold feet. As it is&mdash;" Ward smoked two cigarettes and scowled at the
  scenery. As it was, he did not know just what Buck Olney would do,
  except&mdash; "If he makes a guess I did that, he'll know I'm wise to the
  whole plant. And he'll get me, sure, providing I stand with my back to him
  long enough!" Ward had his back to a high ledge, at that moment, so that he
  did not experience any impulse to look behind him.</p>

  <p>"Buck don't want to drag me up before a jury," he reasoned further. "He'd
  a heap rather pack me in all wrapped up in a tarp, and say how he'd caught me
  with the goods, and I resisted arrest."</p>

  <p>The assurance he felt as to what Buck Olney would do did not particularly
  frighten Ward, even if he did neglect to go to bed in his cabin during the
  next few days. That was common sense, born of his knowledge of the man he was
  dealing with. He went to the cabin warily, just often enough to give it an
  air of occupancy. He frequently sat upon some hilltop and watched a lazy
  thread of smoke weave upward from his rusty stovepipe, but he slept out under
  the stars rolled in his heavy blanket, and he never crossed a ridge if he
  could make his way through a hollow. It is not always cowardice which makes a
  man extremely careful not to fall into the hands of his enemy. There is a
  small matter of pride involved. Ward would have died almost any death rather
  than give Buck Olney the satisfaction of "getting" him. For a few days he was
  cautious as an Indian on the war trail, and then his patience frazzled out
  under the strain.</p>

  <p>At sunrise one morning, after a night of shivering in his blanket, he
  hunched his shoulders in disgust of his caution. If Buck Olney wanted
  anything of him, he was certainly taking his time about coming after it. Ward
  rubbed his fingers over his stubbly jaw, and the uncomfortable prickling was
  the last small detail of discomfort that decided him. He was going to have a
  shave and a decent cup of coffee and eat off his own table, or know the
  reason why, he promised himself while he slapped the saddle on Rattler.</p>

  <p>He was camped in a sheltered little hollow in the hills, where the grass
  was good and there was a spring. It was a mile and more to his claim,
  straight across the upland, and it was his habit to leave Rattler there and
  walk over to the ridge, where he could watch his claim; frequently, as I have
  said, he stole down before daylight and lighted a fire in the stove, just to
  make it look as if he lived there. There was a risk in that, of course,
  granting that the stock inspector was the kind to lie in wait for him.</p>

  <p>Ward rode to the ridge, with his blanket rolled and tied behind the
  cantle. His frying-pan hung behind his leg, and his rifle lay across the
  saddle in front of him. He was going home boldly enough and recklessly
  enough, but he was by no means disposed to walk deliberately into a trap. He
  kept his eye peeled, as he would have expressed it. Also, he left Rattler
  just under the crest of the ridge, took off his spurs, and with his rifle in
  his hands went forward afoot, as he had done every time he had approached his
  cabin since the day he found the corral and the cattle in the canyon.</p>

  <p>In this wise he looked down the steep slope with the sun throwing the
  shadow of his head and shoulders before him. The cabin window blinked
  cheerfully in the sunlight. His span of mares were coming up from the
  meadow&mdash;in the faint hope of getting a breakfast of oats, perhaps. The
  place looked peaceful enough and cozily desirable to a man who has slept out
  for four nights late in the fall; but a glance was all Ward gave to it.</p>

  <p>His eyes searched the bluff below him and upon either side. Of a sudden
  they sharpened. He brought his rifle forward with an involuntary motion of
  the arms. He stood so for a breath or two, looking down the hill. Then he
  went forward stealthily, on his toes; swiftly, too, so that presently he was
  close enough to see the carbuncle scar on the neck of the man crouched behind
  a rock and watching the cabin as a cat watches a mouse-hole. A rifle lay
  across the rock before the man, the muzzle pointing downward. At that
  distance, and from a dead rest, it would be strange if he should miss any
  object he shot at. He had what gamblers call a cinch, or he would have had,
  if the man he watched for had not been standing directly behind him, with
  rifle-sights in a line with the scar on the back of his thick neck.</p>

  <p>"Throw up your hands!" Ward called sharply, when his first flare of rage
  had cooled to steady purpose.</p>

  <p>Buck Olney jumped as though a yellow-jacket had stung him. He turned a
  startled face over his shoulder and jerked the rifle up from the rock. Ward
  raised his sights a little and plugged a round, black-rimmed hole through
  Buck's hat crown.</p>

  <p>"Throw up your hands, I told you!" he said, while the hills opposite were
  still flinging back the sound of the shot, and came closer.</p>

  <p>Buck grunted an oath, dropped the rifle so suddenly that it clattered on
  the rock, and lifted his hands high, in the quiet sunlight.</p>

  <p>"Get up from there and go on down to the shack&mdash;and keep your hands
  up. And remember all the reasons I've got for wanting to see you make a
  crooked move, so I'll have an excuse to shoot." Ward came still closer as he
  spoke. He was wishing he had brought his rope along. He did not feel quite
  easy in his mind while Buck Olney's hands were free. He kept thinking of what
  Billy Louise had said to him about shooting this man, and it was the first
  time since he had known her that he disliked the thought of her.</p>

  <p>Buck got up awkwardly and went stumbling down the steep slope, with his
  hands trembling in the air upon either side of his head. From their nervous
  quivering it was evident that his memory was good, and that it was working
  upon the subject which Ward had suggested to him. He did not give Ward the
  weakest imitation of an excuse to shoot. And so the two of them came
  presently down upon the level and passed around the cabin to the door, with
  no more than ten feet of space between them&mdash;so inexorably had Ward
  crowded close upon the other's stumbling progress.</p>

  <p>"Hold on a minute!"</p>

  <p>Buck stopped as still as though he had gone against a rock wall.</p>

  <p>Ward came closer, and Buck flinched away from the feel of the rifle muzzle
  between his shoulder blades. Ward reached out a cautious hand and pulled the
  six-shooter from its scabbard at Buck's right hip.</p>

  <p>"Got a knife? You always used to go heeled with one. Speak up&mdash;and
  don't lie about it."</p>

  <p>"Inside my coat," grunted Buck, and Ward's lip curled while he reached
  around the man's bulky body and found the knife in its leather sheath.
  Evidently Buck was still remembering with disquieting exactness what reasons
  Ward might have for wanting to kill him.</p>

  <p>"Take down your left hand and open the door."</p>

  <p>Buck did so and put his hand up again without being told.</p>

  <p>"Now go in and stand with your face to the wall." With the rifle muzzle,
  Ward indicated which wall. He noticed how Buck's fingers groped and trembled
  against the wall, just under the eaves, and his lip curled again in the
  expression which Billy Louise so hated to see.</p>

  <p>Ward had chosen the spot where he could reach easily a small coil of rope.
  He kept the rifle pressing Buck's shoulders until he had shifted the knife
  into one hand, leaned, and laid its blade against Buck's cheek.</p>

  <p>"Feel that? I'll jab it clear through you if you give me a chance. Drop
  your hands down behind you." He spent a busy minute with the rope before he
  pushed Buck Olney roughly toward a chair.</p>

  <p>Buck sat down, and Ward did a little more rope-work.</p>

  <p>"Say, Ward, you're making a big mistake if you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" snapped Ward. "Can't you see I'm standing all I can stand, just
  with the sight of you? Don't pile it on too thick by letting me hear you
  talk. I heard you once too often as it is."</p>

  <p>Buck Olney caught his breath and sat very still. His eyes followed Ward as
  the eyes of a caged animal follow its keeper.</p>

  <p>Ward tried to ignore his presence completely while he lighted a fire and
  fried bacon and made coffee, but the hard set of his jaw and the cold
  intentness of his eyes proved how conscious he was of Buck's presence. He
  tried to eat just to show how calm he was, but the bread and bacon choked
  him. He could feel every nerve in his body quiver with the hatred he felt for
  the man, and the bitterness which the sight of him called up out of the past.
  He drank four cups of coffee, black and sweetened at random, which steadied
  him a little. That he did not offer Buck food or drink showed how intense was
  his hatred; as a rule, your true range man is hospitable even to his
  enemies.</p>

  <p>He rose and inspected the ropes to make sure that they were proof against
  twisting, straining muscles, and took an extra turn or two with the loose
  end, just to make doubly sure of the man's helplessness.</p>

  <p>"Where did you leave your horse?" he asked him curtly, when he was
  through.</p>

  <p>Buck told him, his eyes searching Ward's face for mercy&mdash;or at least
  for some clew to his fate&mdash;and dulling with disappointment because he
  could read nothing there but loathing.</p>

  <p>Without speaking again, Ward went out and closed the door firmly behind
  him. He felt relieved to be away from Buck's presence. As he climbed the
  bluff and mentally relived the last hour, he wondered how he had kept from
  shooting Buck as soon as he saw him. Still, that would have defeated his main
  purpose, which was to make Buck suffer. He was afraid he could not make Buck
  suffer as Buck had made him suffer, because there were obstacles in the path
  of a perfect retribution.</p>

  <p>Ward was not cruel by nature; at least he was not more cruel than the rest
  of us; but as he went after Rattler and Buck's horse, it pleased him to know
  that Buck Olney was tied hand and foot in his cabin, and that he was sick
  with dread of what the future held for him.</p>

  <p>Ward was gone an hour. He did not hurry; there was no need. Buck could not
  get away, and a little suspense would do him good.</p>

  <p>Buck's face was pasty when Ward opened the door. His eyes were a bit
  glassy. And from the congested appearance of his hands, Ward judged that he
  had tested to the full his helplessness in his bonds. Ward looked at him a
  minute and got out the makings of a smoke. His mood had changed in his
  absence. He no longer wanted absolute silence between them; instead, he
  showed symptoms of wanting to talk.</p>

  <p>"If I turn you loose, Buck, what will you do?" he asked at last, in a
  curious tone.</p>

  <p>"If you&mdash;Ward, I'll prove I'm a friend to yuh in spite of the idea
  you've got that I ain't. I never done nothing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, of course not." Ward's lip curled. "That was my mistake, maybe. You
  always used to say you were my friend, when&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And that's the God's truth, Ward!" Buck's face was becoming flushed with
  his eagerness. "I done everything I could for you, Ward, but the way the
  cards laid I couldn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get me hanged. I know; you sure tried hard enough!" Ward puffed hard at
  his cigarette, and the lips that held it trembled a little. Otherwise he
  seemed perfectly cool and calm.</p>

  <p>"Say, Ward, them lawyers lied to you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, cut it out, Buck. I've seen you wriggle through a snake-hole before.
  I believe you're my friend, just the way you've always been."</p>

  <p>"That's right, Ward, and I can prove it."</p>

  <p>Ward snorted. "You proved it, old-timer, when you laid up there behind a
  rock with your sights on this shack, ready to get me when I came out. I sabe
  now how it happened Jim McGuire was found face down in the spring behind his
  shack, with a bullet hole in his back, that time. You were his friend,
  too!"</p>

  <p>"Ward, I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up. I just wanted to see if you'd changed any in the last seven
  years. You haven't, unless it's for the worse. You've got to the end of the
  trail, old-timer. When you went laying for me, you fixed yourself a-plenty.
  Do you want to know what I'm going to do with you?"</p>

  <p>"Ward, you wouldn't dare shoot me! With the record you've got, you
  wouldn't stand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who gave it to me, huh? Oh, I heap sabe; you've left word with your
  pardners that you were coming up here to arrest me single-handed. They will
  give the alarm, if you don't show up; and I'll go on the dodge and get caught
  and&mdash;" Ward threw away his cigarette and took a step toward his captive;
  a step so ominous that Buck squirmed in his bonds.</p>

  <p>"Well, you can rest easy on one point. I'm not going to shoot you." Ward
  stood still and watched the light of hope flare in the eyes of his enemy.
  "I'm going to wash the dishes and take a shave&mdash;and then I'm going to
  take you out somewhere and hang you."</p>

  <p>"My God, Ward! You&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I told you, seven years ago," went on Ward steadily, "that I'd see you
  hung before I was through with you. Remember? By rights you ought to hang by
  the heels, over a slow fire! You're about as low a specimen of humanity as I
  ever saw or heard of. You know what you did for me, Buck. And you know what I
  told you would happen; well, it's going to come off according to the
  programme.</p>

  <p>"I did think of running you in and giving you a taste of hell yourself.
  But, as usual, you've gone and tangled up a couple of fellows that never did
  me any particular harm and I don't want to hand them anything if I can help
  it. So I'll just string you up&mdash;after awhile, when I get around to
  it&mdash;and leave a note saying who you are, and that you're the head push
  in this rustling business, and that you helped spend the money that Hardup
  bank lost awhile back; and that you're one of the gazabos&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can't prove it! You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't have to prove it. The authorities will do all that when they get
  the tip I'll give them. And you, being hung up on a limb somewhere, can't
  very well give your pardner the double-cross; so they'll have a fighting
  chance to make their getaway.</p>

  <p>"Now I'm through talking to you. What I say goes. You can talk if you want
  to, Buck; but I'm going to carve a steak out of you every time you open your
  mouth." He pulled Buck's own knife out of its sheath and laid it convenient
  to his hand, and he looked as if he would do any cruel thing he
  threatened.</p>

  <p>He relighted the fire, which had gone out long ago, and set the dish-pan
  on the stove with water to heat. He remade his bunk, spreading on the army
  blanket which he took from the saddle on Rattler. He swept the floor as
  neatly as any woman could have done it and laid the two wolf-skins down in
  their places where they did duty as rugs. He washed and wiped his few dishes,
  keeping Buck's knife always within reach and sending an inquiring glance
  toward Buck whenever that unhappy man made the slightest movement, though
  truth to tell, Buck did not make many. He brought two pails of water and set
  them on the bench inside, and in the meantime he had cooked a mess of prunes
  and set them in a bowl on the window-sill beside his bunk, where the air was
  coolest. He stropped his razor painstakingly and shaved himself in leisurely
  fashion and sent an occasional glance toward his prisoner from the
  looking-glass, which made Buck swallow hard at his Adam's apple.</p>

  <p>And Buck, during all this time, never once opened his lips, except to lick
  his tongue across them, and never once took his eyes off Ward.</p>

  <p>"I've sure put the fear of the Lord into you, haven't I, Buck?" Ward
  observed maliciously, wiping a blob of hairy lather upon a page torn from an
  old Sears-Roebuck catalogue. "I was kinda hoping you had more nerve. I wanted
  to get a whack at you, just to prove I'm not joshing."</p>

  <p>Buck swallowed again, but he made no reply.</p>

  <p>Ward washed his face in a basin of steaming water, got a can of talcum out
  of the dish cupboard, and took the soap-shine off his cheeks and chin. He
  combed his hair before the little mirror&mdash;trying unavailingly to take
  the wave out of it with water, and leaving it more crinkly over his temples
  than it had been in the first place&mdash;and retied the four-in-hand under
  the soft collar of his shirt.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd talk, Buck," he said, turning toward the other. He looked
  very boyish and almost handsome, except for the expression of his eyes, which
  gave Buck the shivers, and the set of his lips, which was cruel. "I've read
  how the Chinks hand out what they call the death-of-a-thousand-cuts; I was
  thinking I'd like to try it out on you. But&mdash;oh, well, this is Friday.
  It may as well go as a hanging." He made a poor job of his calm irony, but
  Buck was not in the mental condition to be critical.</p>

  <p>The main facts were sufficiently ominous to offset Ward's attempt at
  facetiousness. Indeed, the very weakness of the attempt was in itself
  ominous. Ward might try to be coldly malevolent, but the light that burned in
  his eyes, and the rage that tightened his lips, gave the lie to his forced
  composure.</p>

  <p>He went out and led up the horses to the door. He came back and started to
  untie Buck Olney's feet, then bethought him of the statement he had promised
  to write. He got a magazine and tore out the frontispiece&mdash;which, oddly
  enough, was a somber picture of Death hovering with outstretched wings over a
  battlefield&mdash;and wrote several lines in pencil on the back of it, where
  the paper was smooth and white.</p>

  <p>"How's that?" he asked, holding up the paper so that Buck could read what
  he had written. "I ain't in the mood to sit down and write a whole book, so I
  had to boil down your pedigree. But that will do the business all right,
  don't you think?"</p>

  <p>Buck read with staring eyes, looked into Ward's face, and opened his lips
  for protest or pleading. Then he followed Ward's glance to the knife on the
  table and shut his mouth with a snap. Ward laughed grimly, picked up the
  knife, and ran his thumb lightly over the edge to test its keenness. "Put a
  fresh edge on it for me, huh?" he commented. "Well, we may as well get
  started, I reckon. I'm getting almighty sick of seeing you around."</p>

  <p>He loosened the rope that bound Buck to the chair and stood scowling down
  at him, drawing in a corner of his lip and biting it thoughtfully. Then he
  took his revolver and held it in his left hand, while with his right he undid
  the rope which bound Buck's hands.</p>

  <p>"Stick your hands out in front of you," he commanded. "You'll have to ride
  a ways; there isn't any gallows tree in walking distance."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Ward!" Buck's voice was hoarse. The plea came out of its
  own accord. He held his hands before him, however, and he made no attempt to
  get out of the chair. He knew Ward could shoot all right with his left hand,
  you see. He had watched him practice on tin cans, long ago when the two were
  friends.</p>

  <p>"You know what I told you," Ward reminded him grimly and took up the knife
  with a deadly air that made the other suck in his breath. "Hold still! I'm
  liable to cut your throat if I make a mislick."</p>

  <p>Really, it was the way he did it that made it terrible. The thing itself
  was nothing. He merely drew the back of the blade down alongside Buck's ear,
  and permitted the point to scratch through the skin barely enough to let out
  a thin trickle of blood. A pin would have hurt worse. But Buck groaned and
  believed he had lost an ear. He breathed in gasps, but did not say a
  word.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead; talk all you want to, Buck," Ward invited, and wiped the
  knife-blade on Buck's shoulder before he returned the weapon to its sheath in
  his inside coat pocket.</p>

  <p>Buck flinched from the touch and set his teeth. Ward tied his hands before
  him and told him to get up and go out to his horse. Buck obeyed with abject
  submissiveness, and Ward's lip curled again as he walked behind him to the
  door. He had not the slightest twinge of pity for the man. He was gloatingly
  glad that he could make him suffer, and he inwardly cursed his own humanity
  for being so merciful. He ought to have cut Buck's ear off slick and clean
  instead of making a bluff at it, he told himself disgustedly. Buck deserved
  it and more.</p>

  <p>He helped Buck into the saddle, took the short rope in his hands, and
  hobbled Buck's feet under the horse, grasped the bridle-reins, and mounted
  Rattler. Without a word he set off up the rough trail toward Hardup, leading
  Buck's horse behind him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; "SO-LONG, BUCK!"</h2>

  <p class="first">"BEFORE you go, Buck, I want to tell you that you needn't
  jolly yourself into thinking your death will be avenged. It won't. You
  noticed what I wrote; and there isn't a scrap of my writing anywhere in the
  country to catch me up&mdash;" Ward's thoughts went to Billy Louise, who had
  some very good samples, and he stopped suddenly. He was trying not to think
  of Billy Louise, to-day. "Also, when somebody happens to ride this way and
  sees you, I won't be anywhere around."</p>

  <p>"This is the tree," he added, stopping under a cottonwood that flung a big
  branch out over the narrow cow-trail they were traveling. "The chances are
  friend Floyd will be ambling around this way in a day or two," he said
  hearteningly. "He can tend to the last sad rites and take charge of your
  horse. He's liable to be sore when he reads your pedigree, but I don't reckon
  that will make a great deal of difference. You'll get buried, all right,
  Buck."</p>

  <p>Ward dismounted with a most businesslike manner and untied Buck Olney's
  rope from the saddle. "I can't spare mine," he explained laconically. He had
  some trouble in fashioning a hangman's noose. He had not had much practice,
  he remarked to Buck after the first attempt.</p>

  <p>"How do you do it, Buck? You know more about these things than I do," he
  taunted. "You've helped hang lots of poor devils that will be glad to meet
  yuh in hell to-day."</p>

  <p>Buck Olney moistened his dry lips. Ward glanced at his face and looked
  quickly away. Staring, abject terror is not nice to look upon, even though
  the man is your worst enemy and is suffering justly for his sins. Ward's
  fingers fumbled the rope as though his determination were weakening. Then he
  remembered some things, hunched his shoulders, impatient of the merciful
  impulse, and began the knot again. An old prospector had shown him once how
  it was done.</p>

  <p>"Of course, a plain slip-knot would do the business all right," he said.
  "But I'll try and give you the genuine thing, same as you gave the other
  fellows."</p>

  <p>"Ward, for God's sake, let me go!"</p>

  <p>Ward started. He did not know that a man's voice could change so much in
  so short a time. He never would have recognized the tones as coming from Buck
  Olney's loose, complacent lips.</p>

  <p>"Ward, I'll never&mdash;I'll leave the country&mdash;I'll go to South
  America, or Australia, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll go to hell, Buck," Ward cut in inexorably. "You've got your
  ticket."</p>

  <p>"I'll own up to everything. I'll tell you where some of the money's cached
  we got in that Hardup deal, Ward. There's enough to put you on Easy Street.
  I'll tell you who helped&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'd better not," advised Ward harshly, "or I'll make hanging a relief
  to you. I know pretty well, right now, all you could tell. And if I wanted to
  send your pardners up, I wouldn't need your help. It's partly to give them a
  chance that I'm sending you out this way, myself. I don't call this murder,
  Buck. I'm saving the State a lot of time and trouble, that's all; and your
  pardners the black eye they'd get for throwing in with you. I heap sabe who
  was the head push. You got them in to take whatever dropped, so you could get
  off slick and clean, just as you've done before, you&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Buck Olney got it then, hot from the fires of Ward's wrath. A man does not
  brood over treachery and wrong and a blackened future for years, without
  storing up a good many things that he means to say to the friend who has
  played him false. Ward had been a happy-go-lucky young fellow who had faith
  in men and in himself and in his future. He had lived through black, hopeless
  days and weeks and months, because of this man who tried now to buy mercy
  with the faith of his partners.</p>

  <p>Ward stood up and let the rope trail forgotten from his hands while he
  told Buck Olney all the things he had brooded over in bitterness. He had
  meant to keep it all down, but it was another instance of bottled emotions,
  and Buck, with his offer of a fresh bit of treachery, had pulled the cork.
  Ward trembled a little while he talked, and his face grew paler and paler as
  he dug deep into the blackest part of the past, until when he finished he was
  a tanned white. He was shaking at the last; shaking so that he staggered to
  the tree and leaned against it weakly, while he fumbled for tobacco and
  papers.</p>

  <p>In the saddle Buck sat all hunched together as if Ward had lashed him with
  rawhide instead of with stinging words. The muscles of his face twitched
  spasmodically. His eyes were growing bloodshot.</p>

  <p>Ward spilled two papers of tobacco before he got a cigarette rolled and
  lighted. He wondered a little at the physical reaction from his outburst, but
  he wondered more at Buck Olney sitting alive and unhurt on the horse before
  him&mdash;a Seabeck horse which Ward had seen Floyd Carson riding once or
  twice. He wondered what Floyd would do if he saw Buck now and the use to
  which the horse was being put.</p>

  <p>Ward finished the cigarette, rolled another, and smoked that also before
  he could put his hand out before him and hold it reasonably steady. When he
  felt fairly sure of himself again, he lifted his hat to wipe off the sweat of
  his anger, gave a big sigh, and returned to the tying of the hangman's
  noose.</p>

  <p>When he finally had it fixed the way he wanted it, he went close and flung
  the noose over Buck Olney's head. He could not trust himself to speak just
  then. He cast an inquiring glance upward, took Buck's horse by the bridle,
  and led him forward a few steps so that Buck was directly under the
  overhanging limb. Then, with the coil of Buck's rope in his hand, he turned
  back and squirmed up the tree-trunk until he had reached the limb. He crawled
  out until he was over Buck's bullet-punctured hat-crown, sliced off what rope
  he did not need, and flung it to the ground. He saw Buck wince as the rope
  went past him. The pinto horse shied out of position.</p>

  <p>"Take the reins and bring him back here!" Ward called shortly, and gave a
  twitch of the rope as a hint.</p>

  <p>Mechanically Buck obeyed. He did not know that the rope was not yet tied
  to the limb.</p>

  <p>Ward tied the rope securely, leaving enough slack to keep Buck from
  choking prematurely. He fussed a minute longer, with his lip curled into a
  grin of sardonic humor. Then he crawled back to the trunk of the tree and
  slid down carefully so that he would not frighten the pinto.</p>

  <p>He went up and took the hobble off Buck Olney's feet, felt in the seam of
  his coat-lapel, and pulled out four pins, with which he fastened Buck's
  "pedigree" between Buck's shrinking shoulder-blades. Then he stood off and
  surveyed his work critically before he went over to Rattler, who stood dozing
  in the sunshine.</p>

  <p>"Sorry I can't stay to see you off," he told Buck maliciously. "I've
  decided to let you go alone and take your own time about starting. As long as
  that cayuse stands where he is, you're safe as a church. And you've got the
  reins; you can kick off any time you feel like it. Sabe?" He studied Buck's
  horror-marked face pitilessly.</p>

  <p>"You've got about one chance in a million that you can make that pinto
  stand there till someone comes along," he pointed out impartially. "I'm
  willing to give you that chance, such as it is. And if you're lucky enough to
  win out on it&mdash;well, I'd advise you to do some going! South America is
  about as close as you'll be safe. Folks around here are going to know all
  about you, old-timer, whether they get to read what's on your back or
  not.</p>

  <p>"And, on the other hand, it's a million-to-one shot you'll land where your
  ticket reads. I'd hate to gamble on that horse standing in one spot for two
  or three days, wouldn't you?" He wheeled Rattler unobtrusively, his eye on
  the pinto. "I hope he don't try to follow," he said. "I want you to have a
  little time to think about the things I said to you. Well, so-long."</p>

  <p>Ward rode back the way he had come, glancing frequently over his shoulder
  at Buck, slumped in the saddle with a paper pinned to his back like a
  fire-warning on a tree, and his own grass rope noosed about his neck and
  connecting him with the cottonwood limb six feet above his hat crown.</p>

  <p>Ward had not ridden a hundred yards before he heard Buck Olney scream
  hysterically for help. He grinned sourly with his eyebrows pinched together
  and, that hard, strained look in his eyes still. "Let him holler awhile!" he
  gritted. "Do him good, damn him!"</p>

  <p>Until distance and the intervening hills set a wall of silence between,
  Ward heard Buck screaming in fear of death, screaming until he was so hoarse
  he could only whisper; screaming because he had not seen Ward take his knife
  and slice the rope upon the limb so that it would not have held the weight of
  a rabbit.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; FORTUNE KICKS AGAIN</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was past noon when Ward rode down the steep slope to the
  creek bank just above his cabin. He was sunk deep in that mental depression
  which so often follows close upon the heels of a great outburst of passion.
  Mechanically he twitched the reins and sent Rattler down the last shelf of
  bank&mdash;and he did not look up to see just where he was. Rattler was a
  well-trained horse, since he was Ward's. He obeyed the rein signal and
  stepped off a two-foot bank into a nest of loose-piled rocks that slid
  treacherously under his feet. Sure-footed though he was, he stumbled and
  fell; and it was sheer instinct that took Ward's feet from the stirrups in
  time.</p>

  <p>Ward sprawled among the rocks, dazed. The shock of the fall took him out
  of his fit of abstraction, and he pulled away from Rattler as the horse
  scrambled up and stood shaking before him. He tried to scramble up
  also....</p>

  <p>Ward sat and stared stupidly at his left leg where, midway between his
  knee and his foot, it turned out at an unnatural angle. He thought
  resentfully that he had had enough trouble for once, without having a broken
  leg on top of it all.</p>

  <p>"Now this is one hell of a fix!" he stated dispassionately, when pain had
  in a measure cooled his first anger. He looked around him like a man who is
  taking stock of his resources. He was not far from the cabin. He could get
  there by crawling. But what then? Ward looked at Rattler, standing docilely
  within reach of his hand. He considered getting on&mdash;if he could, and
  riding&mdash;well, the nearest place was fifteen miles. And that was a good,
  long way from a doctor. He glanced again at the cabin and tried to study the
  situation impersonally. If it were some other fellow, now, what would Ward
  advise him to do under the circumstances? He reached down and felt his leg
  gingerly. So far as he could tell, it was a straight, simple
  break&mdash;snapped short off against a rock, he judged. He shook his head
  over the thought of riding fifteen miles with those broken bones grinding
  their edges together. And still, what else could he do? He reached out, took
  the reins, and led Rattler a step nearer, so that he could grasp the stirrup.
  With his voice he held the horse quiet while he pulled himself upright upon
  his good leg. Then, with pain-hurried, jerky movements, he pulled off the
  saddle, glanced around him, and flung it behind a buck-brush. He slipped off
  the bridle, flung that after the saddle, and gave Rattler a slap on the rump.
  The horse moved away, and Ward stared after him with set lips. "Anyway, you
  can look after yourself," he said and balanced upon his right leg while he
  swung around and faced the cabin. It was not far&mdash;to a man with two
  sound legs. A hundred yards, perhaps.</p>

  <p>Ward crawled there on his hands and one knee, dragging the broken leg
  after him. It was not a nice experience, but it served one good purpose: It
  wiped from his mind all thought of that black past wherein Buck had figured
  so shamefully. He had enough to think of with his present plight, without
  worrying over the past.</p>

  <p>In half an hour or so Ward rested his arms upon his own doorstep and
  dropped his perspiring face upon them. He lay there a long while, in a dead
  faint.</p>

  <p>After awhile he moved, lifted his head, and looked about him dully at
  first and then with a certain stoical acceptance of his plight. He looked
  into the immediate future and tried to forecast its demands upon his strength
  and to prepare for them. He crawled farther up on the step, reached the
  latch, and opened the door. He crawled in, pulled himself up by the foot of
  his bunk, and sat down weakly with his head in his hands. Like a hurt animal,
  he had obeyed his instinct and had crawled home. What next? If Ward had been
  a weaker man, he would have answered that question speedily with his gun. He
  did think of it contemptuously as an easy way out. If he had never met Billy
  Louise, he might possibly have chosen that way. But Ward had changed much in
  the past two years, and at the worst he had never been a coward. His hurt was
  sending waves of nausea over him, so that he could not concentrate his mind
  upon anything. Then he thought of the bottle of whisky he kept in his bunk
  for emergencies. Ward was not a man who drank for pleasure, but he had the
  Western man's faith in a good jolt of whisky when he felt a cold coming on or
  a pain in his stomach&mdash;or anything like that. He always kept a bottle on
  hand. A quart lasted him a long time.</p>

  <p>He felt along the footboard of the bunk till his fingers touched the
  bottle, drew it out from its hiding-place&mdash;he hid it because stray
  callers would have made short work of it&mdash;and, placing the uncorked
  bottle to his trembling lips, swallowed twice.</p>

  <p>He was steadier now, and the sickness left him like fog before a stiff
  breeze. His eyes went slowly around the cabin, measuring his resources, and
  his needs and limitations. He pulled his one chair toward him&mdash;the chair
  which Buck Olney had occupied so unwillingly&mdash;and placed his left knee
  upon it. It hurt terribly, but the whisky had steadied him so that he could
  bear the pain. He managed to reach the cupboard where he kept his dishes, and
  took down a bottle of liniment and a box of carbolized vaseline which he
  happened to have. He was near the two big, zinc water pails which he had
  filled that morning just to show Buck Olney how cool he was over his capture,
  and he bethought him that water was going to be precious in the next few
  weeks.</p>

  <p>He lifted down one pail and swung it forward as far as he could, and set
  it on the floor ahead of him. Then he swung the other pail beside it.
  Painfully he hitched his chair alongside, lifted the pails and set them
  forward again. He did that twice and got them beside his bunk. He went back
  and inspected the tea-kettle, found it half full, and carried that also
  beside the bunk. Then he took another drink of whisky and rested awhile.</p>

  <p>Bandages! Well, there was a new flour-sack hanging on a nail. He stood up,
  leaned and got it, and while he was standing, he reached for the cigar-box
  where he kept his bachelor sewing outfit; two spools of very coarse thread,
  some large-eyed needles to carry it, an assortment of buttons, and a pair of
  scissors. He cut the flour-sack into strips and sewed the strips together;
  his stitches were neater than you might think.</p>

  <p>When the bandage was long enough, he rolled it as he had seen doctors do,
  and fished some pins out of the cigar-box and laid them where he could get
  his fingers on them quickly. He stood up again, reached across to a box of
  canned milk, and pried off the lid. "I'm liable to need you, too," he
  muttered to the rows of cans, and pulled the box close. He took Buck Olney's
  knife and whittled some very creditable splints from the thin boards, and
  rummaged in his "warbag" under the bunk for handkerchiefs with which to wrap
  the splints.</p>

  <p>When he had done all that he could do to prepare for the long siege of
  pain and helplessness ahead of him, he moved along the bunk until he was
  sitting near the head of it with his broken leg extended before him, and took
  a last look to make sure that everything was ready. He felt his gun at his
  hip, removed belt and all, and threw it back upon the bed. Then he turned his
  head and stared, frowning, at the black butt where it protruded from the
  holster suggestively ready to his hand. He reached out and took the gun,
  turned it over, and hesitated. No telling what insane impulse fever might
  bring upon him&mdash;and still&mdash;no telling what Buck Olney might do when
  he discovered that he was not in any immediate danger of hanging.</p>

  <p>If Buck came back to have it out with him, he would certainly need that
  gun. He knew Buck, a broken leg wouldn't save him. On the other hand, if the
  fever of his hurt hit him hard enough&mdash; "Oh, fiddlesticks!" he told
  himself at last. "If I get crazy enough for that, the gun won't cut much ice
  one way or the other. There are other ways of bumping off&mdash;" So he
  tucked the gun under the mattress at the head of his bed where he could put
  his hand upon it if the need came.</p>

  <p>Then he removed his boots by the simple method of slitting the legs with
  Buck's knife, bared his broken leg in the same manner, swallowed again from
  the bottle, braced himself mentally and physically, gritted his teeth, and
  went doggedly to work.</p>

  <p>A man never knows just how much he can endure or what he can do until he
  is making his last stand in the fight for self-preservation. Ward had no mind
  to lie there and die of blood-poisoning, for instance, and broken bones do
  not set themselves. So, sweating and swearing with the agony of it, he set
  his leg and bound the splints in place, and thanked the Lord it was a
  straight, clean break and that the flesh was not torn.</p>

  <p>Then he dropped back upon the bed and didn't care whether he lived or
  not.</p>

  <p>Followed days of fever, through which Ward lived crazily and lost count of
  the hours as they passed. Days when he needed good nursing, and did not get
  so much as a drink of water, except through pain and effort. Hours when he
  cursed Buck Olney and thought he had him bound to the chair in the cabin.
  Hours when he watched for him, gun in hand, through the window beside the
  bunk.</p>

  <p>It was while he was staring glassy-eyed through the window that his
  attention wandered to the big, white bowl of stewed prunes. They looked good,
  with their shiny, succulent plumpness standing up like little wrinkled
  islands in the small sea of brown juice. Ward reached out with his left
  hand&mdash;he was gripping the gun in his right, ready for Buck when he
  showed up&mdash;and picked a prune out of the dish. It was his first morsel
  of food since the morning when he had tried to eat his breakfast while Buck
  Olney stared at him with the furtive malevolence of a trapped animal. That
  was three days ago. The prune tasted even better than it looked. Ward picked
  out another and another.</p>

  <p>He forgot his feverish hallucination that Buck Olney was waiting outside
  there until he caught Ward off his guard. He lay back on his pillow, his
  fingers relaxed upon the gun. He closed his eyes and lay quiet. Perhaps he
  slept a little.</p>

  <p>When he opened his eyes he was in the dark. The window was a transparent
  black square sprinkled with stars. Ward watched them awhile. He thought of
  Billy Louise; he would like to know how her mother was getting along and how
  much longer they expected to stay in Boise. He thought of the times she had
  kissed him&mdash;twice, and of her own accord. She would not have done it,
  either time, if he had asked her; he knew her well enough for that. She must
  be left free to obey the impulses of that big, brave heart of hers. A girl
  with a smaller soul and one less fine would have blushed and simpered and
  acted the fool generally at the mere thought of kissing a man of her own
  accord. Billy Louise had been tender as Christ Himself, and as sweet and
  pure. Was there another girl like her in the world? Ward looked at the stars
  and smiled. There was never such another, he told himself. And she "liked him
  to pieces"; she had said so. Ward laughed a little in spite of his throbbing
  leg. "Some other girl would have said, 'Ward, I lo-ove you,'" he grinned.
  "Wilhemina is different."</p>

  <p>He lay there looking up at the stars and thinking, thinking. Once his lips
  moved. He was saying "Wilhemina-mine" softly to himself. His eyes, shining in
  the starlight, were very tender. After a long while he fell asleep, still
  thinking of her. A late moon came up and touched his face and showed it thin
  and sunken-eyed, yet with the little smile hidden behind his lips, for he was
  dreaming of Billy Louise.</p>

  <p>Some time after daylight Ward woke and wanted a cigarette, which was a
  sign that he was feeling a little more like himself. He was feverish still,
  and the beating pain in his leg was maddening. But his brain was clear of
  fever-fog. He smoked a little of the cigarette he made from the supply on the
  shelf behind the bunk, and after that he looked about him for something to
  eat.</p>

  <p>He had made a final trip to Hardup two weeks before, and had brought back
  supplies for the winter. And because his pay streak of gravel-bank had
  yielded a fair harvest, he had not stinted himself on the things he liked to
  eat. He lay looking over the piled boxes against the farther wall, and
  wondered if he could reach the box of crackers and drag it up beside the
  bunk. He was weak, and to move his leg was agony. Well, there was the dish of
  prunes on the window-sill.</p>

  <p>Ward ate a dozen or so&mdash;but he wanted the crackers. He leaned as far
  as he could from the bed, and the box was still two feet from his
  outstretched fingers. He lay and considered how he might bring the box within
  reach.</p>

  <p>At the head of the bunk stood the case of peaches and beneath that the
  case of canned tomatoes, the two forming a stand for his lantern. He eyed
  them thoughtfully, chewing a corner of his underlip. He did not want peaches
  or tomatoes just then; he wanted those soda-crackers.</p>

  <p>He took Buck Olney's knife&mdash;he was finding it a most useful souvenir
  of the encounter!&mdash;and pried off a board from the peach box. Two nails
  stuck out through each end of the board. He leaned again from the bed,
  reached out with the board, and caught the nails in a crack on the upper edge
  of the cracker-box. He dragged the box toward him until it caught against a
  ridge in the rough board floor, when the nails bent outward and slipped away
  from the crack. Ward lay back, exhausted with the effort he had made and
  tormented with the pain in his leg.</p>

  <p>After awhile he took the piece of hoard and managed to slide it under the
  box, lifting a corner of it over the ridge. That was hard work, harder than
  you would believe unless you tried it yourself after lying three days
  fasting, with a broken leg and a fever. He had to rest again before he took
  the other end of the board, that had the good nails, and pulled the box up
  beside the bunk.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes he made another effort and pried part of the cover off
  the cracker-box with the knife. Then he pulled out half a dozen crackers and
  ate them, drank half a dipper of water, and felt better.</p>

  <p>In an hour or so he believed he could stand it to fix up his leg a little.
  There was one splint that was poorly wrapped, or something. It felt as though
  it were digging slivers into his leg, and he couldn't stand it any
  longer.</p>

  <p>He pulled himself up until he was sitting with his back against the wall
  at the head of his bunk and smoked a cigarette before he went any farther.
  Then he unwrapped the bandage carefully, removed the splint that hurt the
  worst, and gently massaged the crease in the bruised, swollen flesh where the
  narrow board had pressed so cruelly.</p>

  <p>The crease itched horribly, and it was too sore to scratch. Ward cussed it
  and then got the carbolized vaseline and rubbed that on, wincing at the pain
  of his lightest touch. He did not hurry; he had all the time there was, and
  it was a relief to get the bandage off his leg for awhile. You may be sure he
  was very careful not to move those broken bones a hair's breadth! He rubbed
  on the vaseline, fearing the liniment would blister and increase his
  discomfort, and replaced splint and bandage. He was terribly tired afterwards
  and lay in a half stupor for a long while. He realized keenly that he had a
  tough pull ahead of him, unless someone chanced to ride that way and so
  discovered his plight; which was so unlikely that he did not build any hopes
  upon it.</p>

  <p>He had held himself aloof from the men of the country. He knew the Seabeck
  riders by sight; he had talked a little with Floyd Carson two or three times,
  and had met Seabeck himself. He knew Charlie Fox in a purely casual way, as
  has been related; and Peter Howling Dog the same.</p>

  <p>None of these men were likely to ride out of their way to see him. And now
  that his mind worked rationally, he had no fear of Buck Olney's vengeful
  return. Buck Olney, he guessed shrewdly, was extremely busy just now, putting
  as many miles as possible between himself and that part of Idaho. Unless
  Billy Louise should come or send for him, he would in all probability lie
  alone there until he was able to walk. Ward did not try to comfort himself
  with any delusions of hope.</p>

  <p>As the days passed, he settled himself grimly to the business of getting
  through the ordeal as comfortably as possible. He had food within his reach,
  and a scant supply of water. He worked out the question of diet and of using
  his resources to the best advantage. He had nothing else to do, and his alert
  mind seized upon the situation and brought it down to a fine system.</p>

  <p>For instance, he did not open a can of fruit until the prunes were gone.
  Then he emptied a can of tomatoes into the bowl as a safeguard against
  ptomaine poisoning from the tin, and set the empty can on the floor. During
  the warm part of each day he slid open the window by his bunk and lay with
  the fresh air fanning his face and lifting the hair from his aching
  temples.</p>

  <p>He tried to eat regularly and to make the fruit juice save his water
  supply. Sometimes he chewed jerked venison from the bag over his head, but
  not very often; the salt in the meat made him drink too much. On the whole,
  his diet was healthful and in a measure satisfying. He did not suffer from
  the want of any real necessity, at any rate. He smoked a good many
  cigarettes, but he was wise enough to leave the bottle of whisky alone after
  that first terrible time when it helped him through a severe ordeal.</p>

  <p>He had his few books within reach. He read a good deal, to keep from
  thinking too much, and he tried to meet the days with philosophic calm. He
  might easily be a great deal worse off than he was, he frequently reminded
  himself. For instance, if he had been able to build another room on to his
  cabin, his bunk and his food supply would have been so widely separated as to
  cause him much hardship. There were, he admitted to himself, certain
  advantages in living in one small room. He could lie in bed and reach nearly
  everything he really needed.</p>

  <p>But he was lonesome. So lonesome that there were times when life looked
  absolutely worthless; when the blue devils made him their plaything, and he
  saw Billy Louise looking scornfully upon him and loving some other man
  better; when he saw his name blackened by the suspicion that he was a
  rustler&mdash;preying upon his neighbors' cattle; when he saw Buck Olney
  laughing in derision of his mercy and fixing fresh evidence against him to
  confound him utterly.</p>

  <p>He had all those moods, and they left their own lines upon his face. But
  he had one thing to hearten him, and that was the steady progress of his
  broken leg toward recovery. A long, tedious process it was, of necessity; but
  as nearly as he could judge, the bone was knitting together and would be
  straight and strong again, if he did not try to hurry it too much. He tried
  to keep count of the weeks as they passed. When the days slid behind him
  until he feared he could not remember, he cut a little notch on the
  window-sill each morning with Buck's knife, with every seventh day a longer
  and deeper notch than the others to mark the weeks. The first three days had
  been so hazy that he thought them only two and marked them so; but that put
  him only one day out of his reckoning.</p>

  <p>He lay there and saw snow slither past his window, driven by a whooping
  wind. It worried him to know that his calves were unsheltered and unfed while
  his long stack of hay stood untouched&mdash;unless the cattle broke down his
  fence and reached it. He hoped they would; but he was a thorough workman, and
  in his heart he knew that fence would stand.</p>

  <p>He saw cold rains and sleet. Then there were days when he shivered under
  his blankets and would have given much for a cup of hot coffee; days when the
  water froze in the pails beside the bed&mdash;what little water was
  left&mdash;and he chipped off pieces of ice and sucked them to quench his
  thirst. Days when the tomatoes and peaches were frozen in the cans, so that
  he chewed jerked venison and ate crackers rather than chill his stomach with
  the icy stuff.</p>

  <p>Day by day the little notches and the longer ones reached farther and
  farther along the window-sill, until Ward began to foresee the time when he
  must start a new row. Day by day his cheek-bones grew more clearly defined,
  his eyes bigger and more wistful. Day by day his knuckles stood up sharper
  when he closed his hands, and day by day Nature worked upon his hurt,
  knitting the bones together.</p>

  <p>But, though he was lean to the point of being skinny, his eyes were clear,
  and what little flesh he had was healthy flesh. Though he was lonesome and
  hungry for action and for sight of Billy Louise, his mind had not grown
  morbid. He learned more of the Bobbie Burns verses, and he could repeat
  <i>The Rhyme of the Three Sealers</i> in his sleep, and most of <i>The Lady
  of the Lake</i>. He used to lie and sing at the top of his voice, sometimes:
  <i>The Chisholm Trail</i>&mdash;unexpurgated&mdash;and <i>Sam Bass</i> and
  that doleful ditty about the <i>Lone Prairie</i>, and quaint old Scottish
  songs he had heard his mother sing, long and long ago. His leg would heal of
  itself if he let it alone long enough, he reminded himself often. His mind he
  must watch carefully, if he would keep it healthy. He knew that, and each day
  had its own little battle-ground. Sometimes he won, and sometimes the fight
  went against him&mdash;as is the way with the world.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THE BRAVE BUCKAROO</h2><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="SMCAP">Boise, Idaho, December 23</span>.</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Brave Buckaroo,</span>&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">I wonder if you ever in your whole life got a Christmas
  present? I've been cultivating the Louise of me, and here are the first
  fruits of my endeavor; I guess that's the way they say it. I've spent so much
  time sitting by mommie when she's asleep, and I get tired of reading all the
  time, so a nurse in this ward&mdash;mommie has a room to herself of course,
  but not a special nurse, because I can do a lot of the little
  things&mdash;well, the nurse taught me how to hemstitch. So I got some silk
  and made some nice, soft neckerchiefs&mdash;one for you and one for me.</p>

  <p class="letter">This one I made last. I didn't want your eagle eyes seeing
  all the bobbly stitches on the first one. I hope you like it, Ward. Every
  stitch stands for a thought of the hills and our good times. I've brought
  Minervy back to life, and I try to play my old pretends sometimes. But they
  always break up into pieces. I'm not a kid now, you see. And life is a lot
  different when you get out into it, isn't it? "Mommie doesn't seem to get
  much better. I'm worried about her. She seems to have let go, somehow. She
  never talks about the ranch much, or even worries about whether Phoebe is
  keeping the windows washed. She talks about when she was a little girl, and
  about when she and daddy were first married. It gets on my nerves to see how
  she has slipped out of every-day life. The nurse says that's common, though,
  in sickness. She says I could go home and look after things for a week or so
  just as well as not. She says mommie would be all right. But I hate to leave
  her.</p>

  <p class="letter">I'm awfully homesick for a good old ride on Blue. I miss
  him terribly. Have you seen anything of the Cove folks lately? Seems like I'm
  clear out of the world. I hate town, anyway, and a hospital is the limit for
  dismalness. Even the Louise of me is getting ready to do something awful if I
  have to stay much longer. Mommie sleeps most of the time. I believe they dope
  her with something. She doesn't have that awful pain so bad. So I don't have
  anything to do but sit around and read and sew and wait for her to wake up
  and want something.</p>

  <p class="letter">Pal, the Billy of me is at the exploding point! I believe
  I'll wind up by getting out in the corridor some day and shooting holes in
  all the steam radiators! Did you ever live with one, Ward? Nasty, sizzly
  things; they drive me wild. I'd give the best cow in the bunch for just one
  hour in front of our old stone fireplace and see the sparks go up the
  chimney, and hear the coyotes. Honest to goodness, I'd rather hear a coyote
  howl than any music on earth&mdash;unless maybe it was you singing a
  ten-dollar hoss an' a forty-dollar saddle. I'd like to hear that old trail
  song once more. I sure would, Ward. I'd like to hear it, coming down old
  Wolverine canyon. Oh, I just can't stand it much longer. I'm liable to wrap
  mommie in a blanket and crawl out the window, some night, and hit the trail
  for home. I believe I could cure her quicker right on the ranch. I wish I'd
  never brought her here; I believe it's just a scheme of the doctors to get
  money out of us. I know my poultices did just as much good as their old dope
  does.</p>

  <p class="letter">And this is Christmas, almost. I wonder what you'll be
  doing. Say, Ward, if you want to be a perfect jewel of a man, send me some of
  that jerky you've got hanging at the head of your bunk. I swiped some, that
  last time I was there. It would taste mighty good to me now, after all these
  hospital slops.</p>

  <p class="letter">And write me a nice, long letter, won't you? That's a good
  buckaroo. I've got to stop&mdash;mommie is beginning to wake up, and it's
  time for the doctor to come in and read the chart and look wise and say:
  'Well, how are we to-day? Pretty bright, eh?' I'd like to kick him clear
  across the corridor&mdash;that is, the Billy of me would. And believe me, the
  Billy of me is sure going to break out, some of these days! "I hope you like
  the neckerchief. I want you to wear it; if I come home and find it hasn't
  been washed a couple of times, there'll be something doing! Don't rub soap on
  it, kid. Make a warm lathery suds and wash it. And don't wave it by the
  corners till it dries. Hang it up somewhere. You'll have my stitches looking
  worse frazzled than my temper.</p>

  <p class="letter">Well, a merry Christmas, Pal-o'-mine&mdash;and here's
  hoping you and mommie and I will be eating turkey together at the Wolverine
  when next Christmas comes. Nummy-num! Wouldn't that taste good, though?</p>

  <p class="letter">Now remember and write a whole tablet full to:</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="SMCAP">William Louisa,<br>
  Wilhemina,<br>
  Bill-Loo,<br>
  Bill-The-Conk,<br>
  Billy Louise,<br>
  Flower Of The Ranch-Oh</span>.</p><br>

  <p>Phoebe put that letter on the mantel over the fireplace, the day after
  Christmas. Frequently she felt its puffy softness and its crackly crispness
  and wondered dully what Billy Louise had sent to Ward.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise refrained from expecting any reply until after New Year's.
  Then she began to look for a letter, and when the days passed and brought her
  no word, her moods changed oftener than the weather.</p>

  <p>Ward's literary efforts, along about that time, consisted of cutting
  notches in the window-sill beside his bunk.</p>

  <p>On the day when the stage-driver gave Billy Louise's letter to Phoebe,
  Ward cut a deeper, wider notch, thinking that day was Christmas. Under the
  notch he scratched a word with the point of his knife. It had four letters,
  and it told eloquently of the state of mind he was in.</p>

  <p>It was the day after that when Seabeck and one of his men rode up the
  creek and out into the field where Ward's cattle grazed apathetically on the
  little grass tufts that stuck up out of the snow. Ward was reading, and so
  did not see them until he raised himself up to make a cigarette and saw them
  going straight across the coulee by the line fence to the farther hills. He
  opened the window and shouted after them, but the wind was blowing keen from
  that direction, and they did not hear him.</p>

  <p>Seabeck had been studying brands and counting, and he was telling Floyd
  Carson that everything was straight as a string.</p>

  <p>"He must be out working this winter. I should think he'd stay home and
  feed these calves. The cows are looking pretty thin. I guess he isn't much of
  a stock hand; these nesters aren't, as a general thing, and if it's as
  Junkins says, and he puts all he makes into this place, he's likely hard up.
  Mighty nice little ranch he's got. Well, let's work over the divide and back
  that way. I didn't think we'd find anything here."</p>

  <p>They turned and angled up the steep hillside, and Ward watched them
  glumly. He thought he knew why they were prowling around the place, but it
  seemed to him that they might have stretched their curiosity a little farther
  and investigated the cabin. He did not know that the snow of a week ago was
  banked over the doorstep with a sharp, crusty combing at the top, to prove
  that the door had not been opened for some time. Nor did he know that the two
  had ridden past the cabin on the other side of the creek and had seen how
  deserted the place looked; had ridden to the stable, noted there the
  unmistakable and permanent air of emptiness, and had gone on.</p>

  <p>Floyd Carson alone might have prowled through both buildings, but Seabeck
  was a slow-going man of sober justice. He would not invade the premises of
  another farther than he thought it necessary. He had heard whispers that the
  fellow on Mill Creek might bear investigation, and he had investigated. There
  was not a shadow of evidence that the Y6 cattle had been gotten dishonestly.
  Therefore, Seabeck rode away and did not look into the snow-banked cabin, as
  another man might have done; and Ward missed his one chance of getting help
  from the outside.</p>

  <p>Of course, he was doing pretty well as it was; but he would have welcomed
  the chance to talk to someone. Taciturn as Ward was with men, he had enough
  of his own company for once. And he would have asked them to make him a cup
  of coffee and warm up the cabin once more. Little comforts of that sort he
  missed terribly. If the room had not been so clammy cold, he could have sat
  up part of the time, now. As it was, he stayed in bed to keep warm; and even
  so he had been compelled to drag the two wolf-skins off the floor and upon
  the bed to keep from shivering through the coldest nights and days.</p>

  <p>One day he did crawl out of bed and try to get over to the stove to start
  a fire. But he was so weak that he gave it up and crawled back again, telling
  himself that it was not worth the effort.</p>

  <p>The letter with the silk neckerchief inside gathered dust upon the mantel,
  down at the Wolverine. When the postmark was more than two weeks old, another
  letter came, and Phoebe laid it on the fat one with fingers that trembled a
  little. Phoebe had a letter of her own, that day. Both were thin, and the
  addresses were more scrawly than usual. Phoebe's Indian instinct warned her
  that something was amiss.</p>

  <p>This was Ward's letter: "Oh, God, Ward, mommie's dead. She died last
  night. I thought she was asleep till the nurse came in at five o'clock. I'm
  all alone and I don't know what to do. I wish you could come, but if you
  don't get this right away, I'll see you at the ranch. I'm coming home as soon
  as I can. Oh, Ward, I hate life and God and everything. BILLY LOUISE."</p>

  <p>"Please Ward, stay at the ranch till I come. I want to see you. I feel as
  if you're the only friend I've got left, now mommie's gone. She looked so
  peaceful when they took her away&mdash;and so strange. I didn't belong to her
  any more. I felt as if I didn't know her at all&mdash;and there is such an
  awful gap in my life&mdash;maybe you'll understand. You always do."</p>

  <p>The day that letter was written, Ward drew a plan of the house he meant to
  build some day, with a wide porch on the front, where a hammock would swing
  comfortably. He figured upon lumber and shingles and rock foundation, and
  mortar for a big, deep fireplace. He managed to put in the whole forenoon
  planning and making estimates, and he was so cheerful afterwards that he
  whistled and sang, and later he tied a piece of jerky on the end of a string
  and teased a fat fieldmouse, whose hunger made him venturesome. Ward would
  throw the jerky as far as the string would permit and wait till the mouse
  came out to nibble at it; then he would pull the meat closer and closer to
  the bed and laugh at the very evident perturbation of the mouse. For the time
  being he was a boy indulging his love of teasing something.</p>

  <p>And while Ward played with that mouse, Billy Louise was longing for his
  comforting presence while she faced alone one of the bitterest things in
  life&mdash;which is death. He had no presentiment of her need of him, which
  was just as well, since he was absolutely powerless to help her.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; "WE BEEN SORRY FOR YOU"</h2>

  <p class="first">BILLY LOUISE, having arrived unexpectedly on the stage,
  pulled off her fur-lined mittens and put her chilled hands before the
  snapping blaze in the fireplace. Her eyes were tired and sunken, and her
  mouth drooped pitifully at the corners, but aside from that she did not seem
  much changed from the girl who had left the ranch two months and more
  before.</p>

  <p>"I'll take a cup of tea, Phoebe, but I'm not a bit hungry," she said. "I
  ate just before I left town. How have you been, Phoebe?"</p>

  <p>"We been fine. We been so sorry for you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind that now, Phoebe. I'd rather not talk about it.
  Has&mdash;anybody been here lately?"</p>

  <p>"Charlie Fox, he come las' week&mdash;mebby week before las'. Marthy, she
  got rheumatis in her knee. Charlie, he say she been pretty bad one night. I
  guess she's better now. I tol' I wash for her if he brings me clo'es, but he
  says he wash them clo'es hisself. I guess Charlie pretty good to that old
  lady. He's awful p'lite, that feller is."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is. I'll go up and see her when I get rested a little. I feel
  tired to death, somehow; maybe it's the drive. The road is terribly rough,
  and it was awful tiresome on the train. Has&mdash;Ward been around
  lately?"</p>

  <p>"Ward, he ain't been here for long time. I guess mebbe it's been six weeks
  I ain't seen him. Las' time he was here he wrote that letter. He ain't come
  no more. You let me drag this couch up to the fire, and you lay down and rest
  yo'self. I'll put on more wood. Seems like this is awful cold winter. We had
  six little pigs come, and four of 'em froze. John, he brung 'em in by the
  fire, but it's no good; they die, anyway."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise dropped apathetically upon the couch after Phoebe had helped
  her pull off her coat. She did not feel as though anything mattered much, but
  she must go on with life, no matter how purposeless it seemed. To live awhile
  and work and struggle and know the pain of disappointment and weariness, and
  then to die: she did not see what use there was in struggling. But one had to
  go on just the same. She had borrowed money for mommie's sickness, and she
  would have to repay it; and it was all so purposeless! "How are the cattle
  wintering?" She forced herself to make some show of interest in things.</p>

  <p>"The cattle, they're doing all right. One heifer, she got blackleg and
  die, but the rest they're all right. John, he couldn't find all; two or
  three, they're gone. He says mebby them rustlers got 'em. He looked good as
  he could."</p>

  <p>"Are&mdash;has there been any more trouble about losing stock?" Billy
  Louise shut her hand into a fist, but she spoke in the same tired tone as
  before.</p>

  <p>"I dunno. Seabeck, he told John they don't catch nobody yet. That
  inspector, he come by long time ago. I guess he stopped with Seabeck. He
  ain't come back yet. I dunno where he's gone. Seabeck, he didn't say nothing
  to John about him, I guess. Maybe he went out the other way."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;did you do what I told you, Phoebe, about&mdash;mommie's
  things?"</p>

  <p>For once Phoebe did not answer garrulously. "Yes, I done it," she said
  softly. "The boxes is in the shed when you want 'em."</p>

  <p>"All right, Phoebe. Is the tea ready?"</p>

  <p>While she sipped creamy tea from a solid-silver teaspoon which had been a
  part of mommie's wedding-set, Billy Louise looked around the familiar room
  for which she had hungered so in those deadly, monotonous weeks at the
  hospital. The fire snapped in its stone recess, and the cheerful warmth of it
  comforted her body and in a measure soothed her spirit. She was chilled to
  the bones with facing that bitter east wind for hours, and she had not seen a
  fireplace in all the time she had been away.</p>

  <p>But the place was empty, with no mommie fussing about, worrying over
  little things, gently garrulous. If mommie had come back well, she would have
  asked Phoebe about everything in the house and out of it. There would have
  been a housewifely accounting going on at this minute. Phoebe would be
  apologetic over those grimy windows, instead of merely sympathetic over the
  sorrow in the house. Billy Louise wondered wherein she lacked. For the life
  of her she could not feel that it mattered whether the windows were clean or
  dirty; life was drab and cheerless outside them, anyway.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise in the last few months had tried to picture herself alone,
  with mommie gone. Her imagination was too alive and saw too clearly the
  possibilities for her never to have dwelt upon this very crisis in her life.
  But whenever she had tried to think what it would be like, she had always
  pictured Ward beside her, shielding her from dreary details and lightening
  her burden with his whimsical gentleness. She had felt sure that Ward would
  ride down every week for news of her, and she had expected to find him there
  waiting for her, after that last letter. Whatever could be the matter? Had he
  left the country? Billy Louise's faith had compromised definitely with her
  doubts of him. Guilty or innocent, she would be his friend always; that was
  the condition her faith had laid down challengingly before her doubts. But
  unless he were innocent and proved it to her, she would never marry him, no
  matter how much she loved him. That was the concession her faith had made to
  her doubts.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise had a wise little brain, for all she idealized life and her
  surroundings out of all proportion to reality. She told herself that if she
  married Ward with her doubts alive, her misery would be far greater than if
  she gave him up, except as a friend. Of course, her ideals stepped in there
  with an impracticable compromise. She brought back the Ward Warren of her
  "pretend" life. She dreamed of him as a mutely adoring friend who stood and
  worshiped her from afar, and because of his sins could not cross the line of
  friendship.</p>

  <p>If he were a rustler, she would shield him and save him, if that were
  possible. He would love her always&mdash;Billy Louise could not conceive of
  Ward transferring his affections to another less exacting woman&mdash;and he
  would be grateful for her friendship. She could build long, lovely scenes
  where friendliness was put to the front bravely, while love hid behind the
  mask and only peeped out through the eyes now and then. She did not, of
  course, plan all this in sober reason; she just dreamed it with her eyes
  open.</p>

  <p>It had been in such a spirit that she had written to Ward; though he would
  undoubtedly have read love into the lines and so have been encouraged in the
  planning of that house with the wide porch in front! She had dreamed all the
  way home of seeing Ward at the end of the journey. Perhaps he would come out
  and help her down from the stage, when it stopped at the gate, and call her
  Bill-Loo&mdash;never once had Ward spoken her name as others spoke it, but
  always with a twist of his own which made it different, stamped with his own
  individuality&mdash;and he would walk beside her to the house and comfort her
  with his eyes, and never mention mommie till she herself opened the way to
  her grief. Then he would call her Wilhemina-mine in that kissing way he
  had&mdash; Someone came upon the doorstep and stood there for a moment,
  stamping snow off his feet. Billy Louise caught her breath and waited, her
  eyes veiled with her lashes and shining expectantly. A little color came into
  her cheeks. Ward had been delayed somehow, but he was coming now because she
  needed him and he wanted her&mdash; It was only John Pringle, heavy-bodied,
  heavy-minded, who came in and squeaked the door shut behind him. Billy Louise
  gave him a glance and dropped her head back on the red cushion. "Hello,
  John!" she greeted tonelessly.</p>

  <p>John grinned, embarrassed between his pleasure at seeing Billy Louise and
  his pity for her trouble. His white teeth showed a little under his scraggy,
  breath-frosted mustache.</p>

  <p>"Hello! You got back, hey? She's purty cold again. Seems like it's goin'
  storm some more." He pulled off his mittens and tugged at the ice dangling at
  the corners of his lips. "You come on stage, hey? I bet you freeze." He went
  over and stood with his back to the fire, his leathery brown hands clasped
  behind him, his face still undecided as to the most suitable emotion to
  reveal. "Well, how you like town, hey? No good, I guess. You got plenty
  trouble now. Phoebe and me, we stick by you long as you want us to."</p>

  <p>"I know you will, John." Billy Louise bit her lips against a sudden
  impulse to tears. It was not Ward, but the crude sympathy of this old
  halfbreed was more to her than all the expensive flowers that had been
  stacked upon mommie's coffin. She had felt terribly alone in Boise. But her
  chilled soul was beginning to feel the warmth of friendship in these two
  half-savage servants. Even without Ward, her home-coming was not absolutely
  cheerless, after all.</p>

  <p>"Well, we make out to keep things going," John announced pridefully. "We
  got leetle bad luck, not much. One heifer, she die&mdash;blackleg. Four pigs,
  they froze&mdash;leetle fellers. I save the rest, all right. Ole Mooley, she
  goin' have a calf purty queeck now. I got her in leetle shed by hog-pen.
  Looks like it storm, all right."</p>

  <p>"Felt like it, too." Billy Louise made an effort to get back into the old
  channels of thought. "We'll milk old Mooley, John; I feel as if I could live
  on cream and milk for the next five years. You ought to see the watery stuff
  they call milk in Boise! Star must be pretty near dry now, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>"Purty near." John's voice was beginning to ooze the comfort that warmth
  was giving his big body. "She give two quart, mebby. Spot, she give leetle
  more. I got that white hog fat. I kill him any time now you say."</p>

  <p>"If it doesn't storm, you might kill him to-morrow or next day, John. I'll
  take a roast up to Marthy when I go. I'll go in a day or two." She glanced
  toward the kitchen end of the long room. Phoebe was busy in the pantry with
  the door shut. "Have you seen or heard anything of Ward lately?" she asked
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>"No. I ain't seen Ward for long time. I thought mebbe he be down long time
  ago. He ain't come." John shifted a little farther from the blaze and stood
  teetering comfortably upon the balls of his feet, like a bear. "Mebbe he's
  gone out other way to work."</p>

  <p>"Did he say anything?"</p>

  <p>"No, he don't say nothin' las' time he come. That's&mdash;" John rolled
  his black eyes seekingly at the farther wall while he counted mentally the
  weeks. "I guess that mus' be fo' or five weeks now. Charlie Fox, he come las'
  week."</p>

  <p>"John, you better kill a chicken for Billy Louise. I bet she ain't had no
  chicken since she's gone." Phoebe came from the pantry with her hands all
  flour. "You go now. That young speckled rooster be good, mebby. He's fat.
  He's fightin' all the chickens, anyway."</p>

  <p>"All right. I kill him." John answered with remarkable docility. Usually
  he growled at poor Phoebe and objected to everything she suggested.</p>

  <p>His ready compliance touched Billy Louise more than anything since her
  return. She felt anew the warm comfort of their sympathy. If only Ward had
  been there also! She got up from the couch and went to the window where she
  could look across at the bleak hilltop. She stood there for some minutes
  looking out wistfully, hoping that she would see him ride into view at the
  top of the steep trail. After awhile she went back and curled up on the wide
  old couch and stared abstractedly into the fire.</p>

  <p>John had gone out after the young speckled rooster that fought the other
  chickens and must now do his part toward salving the hurt and cheering the
  home-coming of Billy Louise. John returned, mumbled with Phoebe at the far
  end of the room, and went out again. Phoebe worked silently and briskly,
  rattling pans now and then and lifting the stove lids to put in more wood.
  Billy Louise heard the sounds but dimly. The fire was filled with pictures;
  her thoughts were wandering here and there, bridging the gap between the past
  and the misty future. After awhile the savory odor of the young speckled
  rooster, that had fought all the other chickens but was now stewing in a
  mottled blue-and-white granite pan, smote her nostrils and won her thoughts
  from dreaming. She sat up and pushed back her hair like one just waking from
  sleep.</p>

  <p>"I'll set the table, Phoebe, when you're ready," she said, and her voice
  sounded less strained and tired. "That chicken sure does smell good!" She
  rose and busied herself about the room, setting things in order upon the
  reading-table and the shelves. Phoebe was good as gold, but her housekeeping
  was a trifle sketchy.</p>

  <p>"Ward, he borried some books las' time," Phoebe remarked, lifting the lid
  of the stew kettle and letting out a cloud of delicious-smelling steam. "I
  dunno what they was. He said he'd bring 'em back nex' time he come."</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right," said Billy Louise, and smiled a little. Even so slight a
  thing as borrowed books made another link between them. For a girl who means
  to be a mere friend to a man, Billy Louise harbored some rather dangerous
  emotions.</p>

  <p>She picked up the two letters she had written Ward, brushed off the dust,
  and eyed them hesitatingly. It certainly was queer that Ward had not ridden
  down for some word from her. She hesitated, then threw the thin letter into
  the fire. Its message was no longer of urgent, poignant need. Billy Louise
  drew a long breath when the grief-laden lines crumbled quickly and went
  flying up the wide throat of the chimney. The other letter she pinched
  between her thumbs and fingers. She smiled a little to herself. Ward would
  like to get that. She had a swift vision of him standing over there by the
  window and reading it with those swift, shuttling glances, holding the
  handkerchief squeezed up in his hand the while. She remembered how she had
  begun it&mdash;"Brave Buckaroo"&mdash;and her cheeks turned pink. He should
  have it when he came. Something had kept him away. He would come just as soon
  as he could. She laid the letter back upon the mantel and set a china cow on
  it to keep it safe there. Then she turned brightly and began to set the table
  for Phoebe and John and herself, and came near setting a fourth place for
  Ward, she was so sure he would come as soon as he could. Mommie used to say
  that if you set a place for a person, that person would come and eat with
  you, in spirit if not in reality.</p>

  <p>Phoebe glanced at her pityingly when she saw her hesitating, with the
  fourth plate in her hands. Phoebe thought that Billy Louise had unconsciously
  brought it for mommie. Phoebe did not know that love is stronger even than
  grief; for at that moment Billy Louise was not thinking of mommie at all.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; SEVEN LEAN KINE</h2>

  <p class="first">"AND you looked good, all up above here?" Billy Louise held
  Blue firmly to a curved-neck, circling stand, while she had a last word with
  John before she went off on one of her long rides.</p>

  <p>"All up in the hills, and round over by Cedar Creek, and all over." John's
  mittened gesture was even more sweeping than his statement. "I guess mebby
  them rustlers git 'em."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm going up to the Cove. I may not be back before dark, so don't
  worry if I'm late. Maybe I'll look along the river. I know one place where I
  believe cattle can get down to the bottom, if they're crazy enough to try it.
  You didn't look there, did you?"</p>

  <p>"No, I never looked down there. I know they can't git down nohow."</p>

  <p>"Well, all right; maybe they can't." Billy Louise slackened the reins, and
  Blue went off with short, stiff-legged jumps. It had been a long time since
  he had felt the weight of his lady, and his mood now was exuberant,
  especially so, since the morning was clear, with a nip of frost to tingle the
  skin and the glow of the sun to promise falsely the nearness of spring. The
  hill trail steadied him a little, though he went up the steepest pitch with
  rabbit-jumps and teetered on his toes the rest of the way.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise laughed a little, leaned, and grabbed a handful of slatey
  mane. "Oh, you Blue-dog!" she said, for that was his full name. "Life is
  livable, after all, as long as a fellow has got you and can ride. You
  good-for-nothing old ten-dollar hoss! I&mdash;wonder would it be wicked to
  sing? What do you think, Blue? You'd sing, I know, at the top of your voice,
  if you could. Say, Blue! Don't you wish, you were a donkey, so you could
  stick out your neck and go <i>Yee-ee</i>-haw! <i>Yee-ee</i>&mdash;haw? Try it
  once. I believe you could. It's that or a run, one or the other. You'll bust,
  if you don't do something. I know you!"</p>

  <p>At last on the high level, seeing Blue could not bray his joy to the
  world, Billy Louise let him go. She needed some outlet, herself, after those
  horrible, dull weeks weighted with tragedy. She had been raised on horseback,
  almost; and for two terrible months she had not been in the saddle. And there
  is nothing like the air of the Idaho hills to stir one's blood and send it
  singing.</p>

  <p>Through the sagebrush and rocks, weaving in and out, slacking speed a
  little while he went down into deep gullies, thundering up the other side,
  and racing away over the level again, went Blue. And with him, laughing,
  tingling with new life, growing pinker-cheeked every minute, went Billy
  Louise. Her mother's death did not oppress her then. She thought of her as
  she raced, but she thought of her with a little, tender smile. Her mother was
  resting peacefully, and there was no more pain or worry for the little, pale,
  frail woman who had lived her life and gone her way.</p>

  <p>"Dear old mommie!" said Billy Louise under her breath. "Your kid is almost
  as happy as you are, right now. Don't be shocked, there's a dear, or think
  I'm going to break my neck. Blue and I have just simply got to work off
  steam. You, Blue!" She leaned another inch forward.</p>

  <p>Blue threw up his head, lifted his heels, and ran like a scared jackrabbit
  over the uneven ground. They were not keeping to the trail at all; trails
  were too tame for them in that mood. They ran along the rim-rock at the last,
  where Billy Louise could glance down, now and then, at the river sliding like
  a bright-blue ribbon with icy edges through the gray, snow-spotted hills.</p>

  <p>"Hold on, Blue!" Billy Louise pulled up on the reins. "Quit it, you old
  devil! A mile ought to be enough for once, I should think. There's cattle
  down there in that bottom, sure as you live. And we, my dear sir, are going
  down there and take a look at them." She managed to pull Blue down to
  stiff-legged jumps and then to a walk. Finally she stopped him, so that she
  could the better take in her surroundings and the possibilities of getting
  down.</p>

  <p>In the country it is as in the cities. One forms habits of journeying. One
  becomes perfectly familiar with every hill and every little hollow in certain
  directions, while some other, closer part remains practically unexplored.
  Billy Louise had always loved the Wolverine canyon, and its brother, Jones
  canyon, which branched off from the first. As a child she had explored every
  foot of both, and had ridden the hills beyond. As a young woman she had kept
  to the old playground. Her cattle ranged at the head of the canyons.</p>

  <p>The river bottoms came as near being unknown territory as she could have
  found within forty miles of her home. For one thing, the river bottom was
  narrow, except where was the Cove, and pinched in places till there seemed no
  way of passing from one to another. Little pockets there were, tucked away
  under the rocky bluff with its collar of "rim-rock" above. One might climb
  down afoot, but Billy Louise was true to her range breeding; she never went
  anywhere afoot if she could possibly get there on a horse. And down there by
  the river she never had happened to find it necessary to go, either afoot or
  a-horseback. Still, if cattle could get down there&mdash; "I guess we'll have
  to ride back a way," she said, after a brief inspection, during which Blue
  stood so close to the rim that Billy Louise must have had a clear head to
  feel no tremor of nerves or dizziness.</p>

  <p>She turned and rode slowly back along the edge, looking for the place
  where she believed cattle could get down if they were crazy enough to
  try.</p>

  <p>"Don't look very encouraging, does it, Blue?" Billy Louise stared
  doubtfully at the place, leaning and peering over the rim. "What d'ye think?
  Reckon we can make it?"</p>

  <p>Blue had caught sight of the moving specks far down next the river and up
  the stream half a mile or more. He was a cow-horse to the bone. He knew those
  far-off specks for cattle, and he knew that his lady would like a closer look
  at them. That's what cattle were made for: to haze out of brush and rocks and
  gullies and drive somewhere. So far as Blue knew, cattle were a game. You
  hunted them out of ungodly places, and the game was to make them go somewhere
  else against their wishes. He prided himself on being able to play that game,
  no matter what were the odds against him.</p>

  <p>Now he tilted his head a little and looked down at the bluff beneath him.
  The game was beginning. He must get down that bluff and overtake those specks
  and drive them somewhere. He glanced up and down the bluff to see if a better
  trail offered. Billy Louise laughed understandingly.</p>

  <p>"It's this or nothing, Blue. Looks pretty fierce, all right, doesn't it?
  Of course, if you're going to make a perfect lady get off and
  walk&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Blue snuffed at the ledge with his neck craned. The rim-rock had crumbled
  and sunk low into the bluff, like a too rich pie-crust when the oven is not
  quite hot enough. From a ten- or fifteen-foot wall it shrunk here to a
  three-foot ledge. And below the rocks and bowlders were not actually piled on
  top of one another; there were clear spaces where a wary, wise, old cow-horse
  might possibly pick his way.</p>

  <p>Blue chose his trail and crumpled at the knees with his hoofs on the very
  edge of the ledge; went down with a cat-jump and landed with all four feet
  planted close together. He had no mind to go on sliding in spite of himself,
  and the bluff was certainly steep enough to excuse a bungle.</p>

  <p>"So far so good." Billy Louise glanced ruefully back at the ledge. "We're
  down; but how the deuce do you reckon we'll get up again?"</p>

  <p>Blue was not worrying about that part. He went on, picking his way
  carefully among the bowlders, with his nose close to earth, setting his
  hindlegs stiffly and tobogganing down loose, shale slopes. Billy Louise sat
  easily in the saddle and enjoyed it all. She was making up in big doses for
  the drab dullness of those hospital weeks. She ought to walk down the bluff,
  for this was dangerous play; but she craved danger as an antidote to that
  shut-in life of petty rules and regulations.</p>

  <p>It was with a distinct air of triumph that Blue reached the bottom, even
  though he slid the last forty feet on his haunches and landed belly-deep in a
  soft snow-bank. It was with triumph to match his perky ears that Billy Louise
  leaned and slapped him on the neck. "We made it!" she cried, "and I didn't
  have to walk a step, did I, Blue? You're there with the goods, all
  right!"</p>

  <p>Blue scrambled out of the bank to firm footing on the ripened grass of the
  bottom, and with a toss of his head set off in a swinging lope, swerving now
  and then to avoid a badger hole or a half-sunken rock. They had done
  something new, those two; they had reached a place where neither had ever
  been before, and Blue acted as if he knew it and gloried in the escapade
  quite as much as did his lady.</p>

  <p>The cattle spied them and went trotting away up the river, and Blue
  quickened his stride a little and followed after. Billy Louise left the reins
  loose upon his neck. Blue could handle cattle alone quite as skillfully as
  with a rider, if he chose.</p>

  <p>The cattle dodged into a fringe of bushes close to the river and
  disappeared, which was queer, since the bluff curved in close to the bank at
  that point. Blue pricked up his ears and went clattering after, slowed a
  little at the willow-fringe, stuck his nose straight out before him, and went
  in confidently. The cattle were just ahead. He could smell them, and his
  listening ears caught their heavy breathing. It was very rocky there in the
  willows, and he must pick his way with much care. But when he crashed through
  on the far side, and Billy Louise straightened from leaning low along his
  neck to avoid the stinging branches, the cattle gave a snort and went
  lumbering away, still following the river.</p>

  <p>This was another small, grassy bottom. Blue went galloping after them,
  indignant that they should even attempt to elude him. They were making for
  the head of that pocket, and Billy Louise twitched the reins suggestively.
  Blue obeyed the hint, which proved that the human brain is greater in
  strategy than is brute instinct, and raced in an angle from the fleeing
  cattle. Billy Louise leaned and called to him sharply for more speed; called
  for it and got it. They jumped a washout that the cattle went into and out of
  with great lunges, farther down toward its mouth. They gained a little there,
  and by a burst of hard running they gained more on the level beyond.</p>

  <p>The cattle began to swerve away from them, closer to the river. Blue
  pulled ahead a little, swerving also, and as Billy Louise tightened the
  reins, he slowed and circled them craftily until they huddled on the steep
  bank, uncertain which way to go. Billy Louise pulled Blue down to a walk as
  she drew near and eyed the cattle sharply. They did not look like any of
  hers, after all. There were five dry cows and two steers.</p>

  <p>One of the steers stood broadside to Billy Louise. The brand stared out
  from his dingy red side, the most conspicuous thing about him. Billy Louise
  caught her breath. There was no faintest line that failed to drive its
  message into her range-trained brain. She stared and stared. Blue looked
  around at her inquiringly, reproachfully. Billy Louise sent him slowly
  forward and stirred up the huddled little bunch. She read the brand on each
  one; read the story they shouted at her, of bungling theft. She could not
  believe it. Yet she did believe it, and she went hot with anger and
  disappointment and contempt. She sat and thought for a minute or two,
  scowling at the cattle, while she decided what to do.</p>

  <p>Finally she swung Blue on the down-stream side and shouted the range
  cattle-cry. The animals turned awkwardly and went upstream, as they had been
  going before Billy Louise stopped them. Blue followed watchfully after,
  content with the game he was playing. Where the bluffs drew close again to
  the river, the cattle climbed to a narrow, shelving trail through the rocks
  and went on in single file, picking their way carefully along the bluff.
  Below them it fell sheer to the river; above them it rose steeply, a
  blackened jumble, save where the snow of the last storm lay drifted.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise had never known there was a trail up this gorge. She eyed it
  critically and saw where bowlders had been moved here and there to make its
  passage possible. Her lips were set close together and they still bore the
  imprint of her contempt.</p>

  <p>She thought of Ward. Mentally she abased herself before him because of her
  doubts. How had she dared think him a thief? Her brave buckaroo! And she had
  dared think he would steal cattle! Her very remorse was a whip to lash her
  anger against the guilty. She hurried the cattle along the dangerous trail,
  impatient of their cautious pace.</p>

  <p>When finally they clattered down to the level again, it was to plunge into
  willow thickets whose branches reached out to sweep her from the saddle. Blue
  went carefully, stopping now and then at a word from his lady, to wait while
  she put a larger, more stubborn branch out of her way. She could not see just
  where she was going, but she knew that she was close upon the cattle, and
  that they seemed familiar with the trail. Now and then she caught sight of a
  rough-haired rump and switching tail in the thicket before her. Then the
  whip-like branches would swing close, and she could see nothing but their
  gray tangle reaching high above her head. She could hear the crackling
  progress of the cattle close ahead, and the gurgling clamor of the river
  farther away to her right. But she could not see the bluff for the
  close-standing willows, and she did not know whether it was near or far to
  its encircling wall.</p>

  <p>Then, just as she was beginning to think the willows would never end, she
  came quite suddenly out into the open, and Blue lifted himself and jumped a
  dry ditch. The cattle were before her, shambling along the fenced border of a
  meadow.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; THE BILLY OF HER</h2>

  <p class="first">SINCE she had closed up on the cattle and had read on their
  sides the shameful story of theft, Billy Louise had known that she would
  eventually come out at the lower end of the Cove; and that in spite of the
  fact that the Cove was not supposed to have any egress save through the
  gorge. What surprised her was the short distance; she had not realized that
  the bluff and the upland formed a wide curve, and that she had cut the
  distance almost in half by riding next the river.</p>

  <p>She seemed in no doubt as to what she would do when she arrived. Billy
  Louise was not much given to indecision at any time. She drove the cattle
  into the corral farthest from the house, rode on to the stable, and stopped
  Blue with his nose against the fence there and with his reins dragging. Then,
  tight-lipped still, she walked determinedly along the path to the gate that
  led through the berry-jungle to the cabin.</p>

  <p>She opened the gate and stepped through, closing it after her. She had not
  gone twenty feet when there was a rush from the nearest thicket, and Surbus,
  his hair ruffed out along his neck, growled and made a leap at her with bared
  fangs.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise had forgotten about Surbus. She jumped back, startled, and
  the dog missed landing. When he sprang again he met a thirty-eight calibre
  bullet from Billy Louise's gun and dropped back. It had been a snap shot,
  without any particular aiming; Billy Louise retreated a few steps farther,
  watching the dog suspiciously. He gathered himself slowly and prepared to
  spring at her again. This time Billy Louise, being on the watch for such a
  move, aimed carefully before she fired. Surbus dropped again, limply&mdash;a
  good dog forever more.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise heard a shrill whistle and the sound of feet running. She
  waited, gun in hand, ready for whatever might come.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Charlie! Somebody's come; the bell, she don't reeng." Peter Howling
  Dog, a pistol in his hand, came running down the path from the cabin. He saw
  Billy Louise and stopped abruptly, his mouth half open.</p>

  <p>From a shed near the stable came Charlie, also running. Billy Louise
  waited beside the gate. He did not see her until he was close, for a tangled
  gooseberry bush stood between them.</p>

  <p>"What was it, Peter? Somebody in the Cove? Or was it you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, it wasn't Peter; it was me." Billy Louise informed him calmly and
  ungrammatically. "I shot Surbus, that's all."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Why, Miss Louise, you nearly gave me heart failure! How are you? I
  thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You thought somebody had gotten into the Cove without your knowing it.
  Well, someone did. I rode up from below, along the river."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;did you? Pretty rough going, wasn't it? I didn't think
  it could be done. Come in; Aunt Martha will be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't think she'll be overjoyed to see me." Billy Louise stood still
  beside the gooseberry bush, and she had forgotten to put away her gun. "I
  drove up those cattle you had down below. You're awfully careless, Charlie! I
  should think Peter or Marthy would have told you better. When a man steals
  cattle by working over the brands, it's very bad form to keep them right on
  his ranch in plain sight. It&mdash;isn't done by the best people, you know."
  Her voice stung with the contempt she managed to put into it. And though she
  smiled, it was such a smile as one seldom saw upon the face of Billy
  Louise.</p>

  <p>"What's all this? Worked brands! Why, Miss Louise, I&mdash;I wouldn't know
  how to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know. You did an awful punk job. A person could tell in the dark it was
  the work of a greenhorn. Why didn't you let Peter do it, or Marthy? You could
  have done a better job than that, couldn't you, Marthy?"</p>

  <p>Poor old Marthy, with her rheumatic knees and a gray hardness in her
  leathery face, had come down the path and stood squarely before Billy Louise,
  her hands knuckling her flabby hips, her hair blowing in gray, straggling
  wisps about her bullet head.</p>

  <p>"Better than what? Come in, Billy Louise. I'm right glad to see ye back
  and lookin' so well, even if yuh do 'pear to be in one of your tantrums.
  How's yer maw?"</p>

  <p>Billy Louise gasped and went white. "Mommie's dead," she said. "She died
  the ninth." She drew another gasping breath, pulled herself together, and
  went on before the others could begin the set speeches of sympathy which the
  announcement seemed to demand.</p>

  <p>"Never mind about that, now. I'm talking about those Seabeck cattle you
  folks stole. I was telling Charlie how horribly careless he is, Marthy. Did
  you know he let them drift down the river? And a blind man could tell a mile
  off the brands have been worked!" Billy Louise's tone was positively venomous
  in its contempt. "Why didn't you make Charlie practise on a cowhide for
  awhile first?" she asked Marthy cuttingly.</p>

  <p>Marthy ignored the sarcasm. Perhaps it did not penetrate her stolid mind
  at all. "Charlie never worked any brands, Billy Louise," she stated with her
  glum directness.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I beg his pardon, I'm sure! Did you?"</p>

  <p>"No, I never done such a thing, neither. I don't know what you're talkin'
  about."</p>

  <p>"Well, who did, then?" Billy Louise faced the old woman pitilessly.</p>

  <p>"I d'no." Marthy lifted her hand and made a futile effort to tuck in a few
  of the longest wisps of hair.</p>

  <p>"Well, of all the&mdash;" The stern gray eyes of Billy Louise flew wide
  open at the effrontery of the words. If they expected her to believe that!
  "That's it, Miss Louise. That's the point we'd like to settle, ourselves. I
  know it sounds outrageous, but it's a fact. Peter and I found those cattle up
  in the hills, with our brand worked over the V. On my word of honor, not one
  of us knows who did it."</p>

  <p>"But you've got them down here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;" Charlie threw out a hand helplessly. His eyes met hers with
  appealing frankness. "We couldn't rub out the brands; what else could we do?
  I figured that somebody else would see them if we left them out in the hills,
  and it might be rather hard to convince a man; you see, we can't even
  convince you! But, so help me, not one of us branded those cattle, Miss
  Louise. I believe that whoever has been rustling stock around here
  deliberately tried to fix evidence against us. I'm a stranger in the country,
  and I don't know the game very well; I'm an easy mark!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're that, all right enough!" Billy Louise spoke with blunt
  disfavor, but her contemptuous certainty of his guilt was plainly wavering.
  "To go and bring stolen cattle right down here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It seemed to me they'd be safer here than anywhere else," Charlie
  observed naively. "Nobody ever comes down here, unknown to us. I had it
  sized up that the fellow who worked those brands would never dream we'd bring
  the stock right into the Cove. Why, Miss Louise, even I would know better
  than to put our brand on top of Seabeck's and expect it to pass inspection.
  If I wanted to steal cattle, I wouldn't go at it that way!"</p>

  <p>Billy Louise glanced uncertainly at him and then at Marthy, facing her
  grimly. She did not know what to think, and she showed it.</p>

  <p>"How do you mean&mdash;the real rustlers?" She began hesitatingly; and
  hesitation was not by any means a mental habit with Billy Louise.</p>

  <p>"I mean just what I said." Charlie's manner was becoming more natural,
  more confident. "I've been riding through the hills a good deal, and I've
  seen a few things. And I've an idea the fellow got a little uneasy." He saw
  her wince a little at the word "fellow," and he went on, with an impulsive
  burst of confidence. "Miss Louise, have you ever, in your riding around up
  above Jones Canyon, in all those deep little gulches, have you ever seen
  anything of a&mdash;corral, up there?"</p>

  <p>Billy Louise held herself rigidly from starting at this. She bit her lips
  so that it hurt. "Whereabouts is it?" she asked, without looking at him. And
  then: "I thought you would go to any length before you would accuse
  anybody."</p>

  <p>"I would. But when, they deliberately try to hand me the blame&mdash;and
  I'm not accusing anybody&mdash;anybody in particular, am I? The corral is at
  the head of a steep little canyon or gulch, back in the hills where all these
  bigger canyons head. Some time when you're riding up that way, you keep an
  eye out for it. That," he added grimly, "is where Peter and I ran across
  these cattle; right near that corral."</p>

  <p>The heart of Billy Louise went heavy in her chest. Was it possible? Doubts
  are harder to kill than cats or snakes. You think they're done for, and here
  they come again, crowding close so that one can see nothing else.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea at all, who&mdash;it is?" She forced the words out of
  her dry throat. She lifted her head defiantly and looked at him full, trying
  to read the truth from his eyes and his mouth.</p>

  <p>Charlie Fox met her look, and in his eyes she read pity&mdash;yes, pity
  for her. "If I have," he said, with an air of gently deliberate evasion,
  "I'll wait till I am dead sure before I name the man. I'm not at all sure I'd
  do it even then, Miss Louise; not unless I was forced to do it in
  self-defense. That's one reason why I brought the cattle down here. I didn't
  want to be placed in a position where I should be compelled to fight
  back."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise ran her gloved fingers down the barrel of her gun, and stuck
  the weapon back in its holster. "I killed Surbus, Marthy," she said dully. "I
  had to. He came at me."</p>

  <p>Marthy turned heavily toward the spot which Billy Louise indicated with
  her downward glance. She had not seen the dog lying there half hidden by a
  berry bush. Marthy gave a grunt of dismay and went over to where Surbus lay
  huddled. Her hard old face worked with emotion.</p>

  <p>"You shot him, did yuh?" Marthy's voice was harsh with reproach. "What did
  he do to yuh, that you had to go t' work and shoot him? He warn't your dog,
  he was mine! I must say you're gittin' high-an'-mighty, Billy Louise, comin'
  here shootin' my dog and accusin' Charlie and me to our faces uh bein'
  thieves. And your maw not cold in 'er grave yit! I must say you're gitting
  too high-an'-mighty fer old Marthy. And me payin' fer your schoolin' and
  never gitting so much as a thankye fer it, and scrimpin' and savin' to make a
  lady out of yuh. And here you come in a tantrum, callin' me a thief right in
  my face! You knowed all along who worked them brands. If yuh don't, I kin
  mighty quick tell ye&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now, Aunt Martha, never mind scolding Billy Louise; you know you think as
  much of her as you do of me, and that's throwing a big bouquet at myself!"
  Charlie went up and laid his arm caressingly over the old woman's shoulder.
  "You don't want to let this upset you, Aunt Martha. Surbus was a
  mean-tempered brute with strangers. You know that. I don't blame Miss Louise
  in the least. She was frightened when he came at her, and she hadn't presence
  of mind enough to see he was only bluffing and wouldn't hurt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bluffing, was he?" Billy Louise roused herself to meet this covert attack
  upon her courage. "So are you bluffing. And so is Marthy, when she says she
  paid for my&mdash;" She stopped, confronting an accusing memory of mommie's
  mysterious silence about the school money, and her own passing curiosity
  which had never been satisfied. "Even if she did, I don't know why she need
  throw it up to me now. I never asked her for money. Nobody ever did. And that
  has nothing to do with Surbus, anyway. He's a nasty, mean brute that ought to
  have been killed long ago. I'm not a bit sorry. I'm glad I did kill him."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know yuh be. You're hard as&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't talk about hardness, if I were you, Marthy! What are you,
  right now&mdash;and always? Was I to blame for thinking those cattle had been
  stolen? They're in the Cove, with your brand on. And unless you pay Seabeck
  for them, you're stealing them if you keep them. It doesn't matter who put
  the brand on; you're keeping the cattle. What do you call that, I'd like to
  know? They're down here in the big corral now. If you mean to do what's
  square, you'll take them up to Seabeck's and explain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Explain who it was ran our brand on?" Charlie's voice was silk over iron.
  "I'm afraid if I were forced into explanations, I'd have to tell all I know,
  Miss Louise. Do you advise that&mdash;really?"</p>

  <p>"I don't advise anything." Baffled and angry and hurt to the very soul of
  her, Billy Louise opened the gate and went out. "It strikes me you Cove folks
  are not wanting advice these days, or needing it. If you know anything to
  tell, for heaven's sake don't hold back on my account! It's nothing to me,
  one way or the other. I'm no rustler, and no friend of rustlers, if that's
  what you're hinting at." She left them with a proud lift to her chin and a
  very straight back, went to Blue, and mounted him mechanically. Billy Louise
  was "seeing red" just then. She rode back past the gate, the three were still
  standing there close together, talking. Billy Louise swung round in the
  saddle so that she faced them.</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry, Marthy, about that school-money," she called out
  angrily. "I'll take your word for it and pay you back every cent, with legal
  rate of interest. And I'm darned glad I did shoot Surbus!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, say, Miss Louise!" Charlie called placatingly. "Please don't go away
  feeling&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You go to the devil!" Billy Louise flung back at him and touched Blue
  with her heel. "I hope that shocked some of the politeness out of him,
  anyway," she added grimly to herself. "Oh, I hate everything&mdash;Ward and
  God and all! I hate life&mdash;I hate it!"</p>

  <p>She pulled Blue down to a walk and rode slowly for a couple of rods,
  fighting against the reaction that crept inexorably over her anger, chilling
  it and making it seem weak and unworthy. With a sudden impulse born of her
  stern instincts of justice, she jerked Blue around and galloped back. Charlie
  had disappeared, and Peter Howling Dog was walking sullenly toward the
  corraled cattle. Marthy was going slowly up the path to the cabin, looking
  old and bent and broken-spirited because of her bowed shoulders and stiff,
  rheumatic gait, but harsh and unyielding as to her face. Billy Louise stopped
  by the fence and called to her. Marthy turned, stared at her sourly, and
  stood where she was.</p>

  <p>"Wall, what d'yuh want now?" she asked uncompromisingly.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise fought back an answering antagonism. She must be just; she
  could not blame Marthy for feeling hard toward her. She had insulted them
  horribly and killed Marthy's dog.</p>

  <p>"I want to tell you I'm sorry I was so mean, Marthy," she said bravely. "I
  haven't any excuse to make for it; only you must see yourself what a shock it
  would be to a person to find those cattle down here. But I know you're
  honest, and so is Charlie. And I know you'll do what's right. I'm sorry I
  told Charlie to go to the devil, and I'm sorry I shot your dog, Marthy."</p>

  <p>Apologies did not come easily to Billy Louise. She wheeled then and rode
  away at a furious gallop, before Marthy could do more than open her grim lips
  for reply.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; BILLY LOUISE GETS A SURPRISE</h2>

  <p class="first">FRIGHTENED, worried, sick at heart because her crowding
  doubts and suspicions had suddenly developed into black certainty just when
  she had thought them dead forever, Billy Louise rode up the narrow, rocky
  gorge. She had come to have a vague comprehension of the temptation Ward must
  have felt. She had come to accept pityingly the possibility that the canker
  of old influences had eaten more deeply than appeared on the surface. She had
  set herself stanchly beside him as his friend, who would help him win back
  his self-respect. She felt sure that he must suffer terribly with that keen,
  analytical mind of his, when he stopped to think at all. He had no warped
  ethics wherewith to ease his conscience. She knew his ideas of right and
  wrong were as uncompromising as her own, and if he stole cattle, he did it
  with his eyes wide open to the wrong he was doing. And yet&mdash; "That's bad
  enough, but to try and fasten evidence on someone else!" Billy Louise gritted
  her teeth over the treachery of it. She believed he had done that very thing.
  How could she help it? She had seen the corral and had seen Ward ride away
  from it in the dusk of evening; or she believed she had seen him, which was
  the same thing. She knew that Ward's prosperity was out of proportion with
  his visible resources. And she knew what lay behind him. Was his version of
  the past after all the correct one? Might not the paragraph she had burned
  been nothing more than the truth? Billy Louise fought for him; fought with
  her stern, youthful judgment which was so uncompromising. It takes years of
  close contact with life to give one a sure understanding of human weakness
  and human endeavor.</p>

  <p>At the ford, when Blue would have crossed and taken the trail home, Billy
  Louise reined him impulsively the other way. Until that instant she had not
  intended to seek Ward, but once her fingers had twitched the reins against
  Blue's neck, she did not hesitate; she did not even argue with herself. She
  just glanced up at the sun, saw that it was not yet noon&mdash;so much may
  happen in two or three hours!&mdash;and sent Blue up the hill at a lope.</p>

  <p>She did not know what she would do or what she would say when she saw
  Ward. She knew that she was full of bitterness and disappointment and
  chagrin. She had accused innocent persons of a crime. Ward had placed her in
  that position and compelled her to recant and apologize. She had offended
  Marthy beyond forgiveness&mdash;and Charlie Fox. Her face burned with shame
  when she remembered the things she had said to them. Ward was the cause of
  that humiliation; and Ward was going to know exactly what she thought of him;
  beyond that she did not go.</p>

  <p>The two mares fed dispiritedly at the lowest corner of the field, their
  hair rough with exposure to the winter winds and the storms, their ribs
  showing. With all the hay he had put up, Ward might at least keep his horses
  in better shape, Billy Louise censured, as she passed them by. A few head of
  cows and calves wandered aimlessly among the thinnest fringe of willows along
  the creek; they showed more ribs than did the mares. Billy Louise pulled her
  lips tight. They did not look as though they had been fed a forkful of hay
  all winter; your true range man or woman gets to know these things
  instinctively.</p>

  <p>Farther along, Billy Louise heard a welcoming nicker and turned her head.
  Here came Rattler, thin-flanked and rough-coated, trotting down a shallow
  gulley to meet Blue. The two horses chummed together whenever Ward was at the
  Wolverine. Billy Louise pulled up and waited till Rattler reached her. He and
  Blue rubbed noses, and Blue laid back his ears and shook his head with teeth
  bared, in playful pretense of anger. Rattler kicked up his heels in disdain
  at the threat and trotted alongside them.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise rode with puckered eyebrows. Ward might neglect his stock,
  but he would never neglect Rattler like this. And he must be at home, since
  here was his horse. Or else...</p>

  <p>She struck Blue suddenly with her rein-ends and went clattering up the
  trail where the snow lay in shaded, crusty patches rimmed with dirt. The
  trail was untracked save by the loose stock. Where was Ward? What had
  happened to him? She looked again at Rattler. There was no sign of recent
  saddle-marks along his side, no telltale imprint of the cinch under his
  belly. Where was Ward? Blind, unreasoning terror filled Billy Louise. She
  struck Blue again and plunged into the icy creek-crossing near the stable.
  She stopped there just long enough to see how empty and desolate it was, and
  how the horses and cattle had huddled against its sheltering wall out of the
  biting winds; and how the door was shut and fastened so that they could not
  get in. She opened it and looked in, and shut it again. Then she turned and
  ran, white-faced, to the cabin. Where was Ward? What had happened to Ward?
  Thief or honest man, treacherous or true&mdash;what had happened to him?
  Billy Louise saw the doorstep banked over with old, crusted snow. Her heart
  gave a jump and stopped still. She felt her knees shake under her. Her face
  seemed to pinch together, the flesh clinging close to the bones. Her whole
  being seemed to contract with the deadly fear that gripped her. It was like
  that chill morning when she had crept out of her cot and gone over to
  mommie's bed and had lifted mommie's hand that was hanging down....</p>

  <p>She came to herself; she was running up the creek, away from the cabin.
  Running and stumbling over rocks, and getting tripped with her riding-skirt.
  She stopped, as soon as she realized what she was doing; she stopped and
  stood with her hands pressed hard against each side of her face, forcing
  herself to calmness again&mdash;or at least to sanity. She had to go back.
  She told herself so, many times. "You've got to go back!" she repeated, as if
  to a second person. "You can't be such a fool; you've got to go back. And
  you've got to go inside. You've got to do it."</p>

  <p>So Billy Louise went back to the cabin, slowly, with shaking legs and a
  heart that fluttered and stopped, fluttered and jumped and stopped, and made
  her stagger as she walked. She reached the doorstep and stood there with her
  palms pressing hard against her cheeks again. "You've got to do it. You've
  got to!" she whispered to herself commandingly.</p>

  <p>She never doubted that Ward was inside. She thought she would find him
  dead&mdash;dead and horrible, perhaps. No other solution seemed to fit the
  circumstances. He was in there, dead. He had been dead for some time, because
  there were no saddle-marks on Rattler, and because the snow was crusted over
  the doorstep with never a mark to break its smooth roundness. She had to go
  in. She was the person who must find him and do what she could. She must do
  it, because he was Ward&mdash;her Ward.</p>

  <p>It took courage to open that door, but Billy Louise had courage enough to
  open it, and to step inside and close the door after her. She did not look at
  anything in the cabin while she did it, though. She kept her eyelids down so
  that she only saw the floor directly in front of the door. She had a sense of
  relief that it looked perfectly natural, though dusty.</p>

  <p>"Throw up your hands!" came hoarsely from the bunk. Billy Louise gasped
  and pulled her gun, and dropped crouching to the floor. Also she looked up.
  She had not recognized that voice, and while she had never except in
  imagination faced an emergency like this, she had played robbers and rescues
  too often not to have formed a mental habit to fit the situation. What she
  did she had done many, many times in her "pretend" world, sitting somewhere
  dreaming.</p>

  <p>From her crouching position she looked into Ward's fever-wild eyes. He was
  sitting up in the bunk, and he was pointing his big forty-five at her
  relentlessly. "Get up from there!" he ordered sternly. "Don't try any game
  like that on me, Buck Olney! Get up and go over and sit in that chair. I've
  got a few things to say to you."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise somehow grasped the truth, up to a certain point. Ward was
  sick; so sick he didn't know her. She thought she would better humor him. She
  got up and went and sat in the chair as he directed.</p>

  <p>Ward, keeping the gun pointing her way, sneered at her in a way that made
  the soul of Billy Louise crimple. She faced him big-eyed, too amazed at the
  change in him to feel any fear that he would harm her. He had whiskers two
  inches long. She wouldn't have known him except for his hair&mdash;and that
  was terribly tousled; and his eyes, though they were wild and angry. His
  voice was hoarse, and while he glared at her, he coughed with a hard, croupy
  resonance.</p>

  <p>"So you came back, did yuh?" he asked grimly at last. "Well, you didn't
  get a chance to plug me in the back. How long did you lay up there on the
  bluff this time, waiting to catch me when I wasn't looking? I've been wishing
  I'd left that rope so it would have hung you, you
  damned&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!" (Billy Louise listened round-eyed to certain
  man-sized epithets strange to her ears.) "I suppose you and Foxy and that
  halfbreed have been fixing up some more evidence, huh? You figure that I
  can't catch 'em this time and work the brands over, so they'll stand Y6es,
  and I'll get railroaded to the pen. Well, you've overplayed your hand,
  old-timer. I let you fellows down easy, last time. I don't reckon Foxy
  objected much to those few I turned back to him, and I don't reckon you did
  any kicking when you found I'd cut the rope so it wouldn't hold your rotten
  carcass. You can't let well enough alone, though. You thought you'd raise me,
  did you? You thought you'd come back and try another whack at me behind my
  back. You knew damned well I wasn't the kind of man that would jump the
  country. You knew you'd find me right here, attending to my business like
  I've always done.</p>

  <p>"But you've overplayed your hand. This time I'm going to get you&mdash;and
  Foxy and the breed along with you. It was a damned, rotten trick, running
  Y6es over Seabeck's brand. If I hadn't caught you in the act, you'd have
  planted them cattle where all hell couldn't have saved me when they were
  found. If I hadn't caught you at it and run MK monograms over the whole
  cheese, I'd have been up against it for fair. So now you're going to get
  what's coming to yuh. I won't take any chances on your not trying it again.
  I'm going to protect myself right.</p>

  <p>"You throw that gun on the bed." (Billy Louise did so, her eyes still upon
  Ward's flushed face.) "Now, get down that tablet from the shelf. Here's a
  pencil." He drew one from under his pillow and tossed it toward her. "Now you
  write the truth about all this rustling. It's a bigger thing than shows right
  in this neighborhood. I know that. And I know too that Foxy has been pulling
  down some on the side. He never paid for all the stock that's running around
  vented and rebranded MK. I've got that sized up. Pretty smooth trick, too; a
  heap better than working brands. He ought to have been satisfied with
  that&mdash;but a crook never is satisfied. I knew he wasn't the tenderfoot he
  tried to make out, and when I saw some of his stock and that gate fixed to
  ring a bell when it was opened, I knew he was a crook. But he made a big
  mistake when he threw in with you, you&mdash; "I want you to write down the
  truth about that Hardup deal; who was in with you. I know, all right, but I
  want it down on paper. And I want to know how long Foxy's been in with you,
  and who's working the game on the outside. Get busy; write it all down. I'll
  give you all the time you need; don't leave out anything. Dates and all, I
  want the whole graft. Don't try to get away. I've got this gun loaded to the
  guards, and you know I'm aching for an excuse&mdash;" He stopped and coughed
  again, hoarsely, rackingly. Then he lay quiet, except for his rasping breath
  and watched.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise, with the tablet on her trembling knees, pretended to write.
  From under her lashes she watched Ward curiously. She saw his attention
  waver, saw his eyes wander aimlessly about the room. She sat very still and
  waited, making scrawly marks that had no meaning at all. She saw Ward's
  fingers loosen on the revolver, saw his head turn wearily on the pillow. He
  was staring out through the window at the brilliant blue of the sky with the
  dazzling white clouds drifting like bits of cotton to the northward. He had
  forgotten her.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; THE HOOKIN'-COUGH MAN</h2>

  <p class="first">BILLY LOUISE waited another minute or two, weighing the
  possibilities. She saw Ward's fingers drop away from the gun, but they
  remained close enough for a dangerously quick gripping of it again, if the
  whim seized him. Still&mdash;surely to goodness, Ward would never get crazy
  enough to hurt her! Perhaps her feminine assurance of her hold on him, more
  than her courage, kept her nerves fairly steady. She bit the pencil absently,
  watching him.</p>

  <p>Ward turned his head restlessly on the pillow and coughed again. Billy
  Louise got up quietly, went close to the bed, and laid her hand on his
  forehead. His head was hot, and the veins were swollen and throbbing on his
  temples.</p>

  <p>"Brave Buckaroo got a headache?" she queried softly, stroking his temples
  soothingly. "Got the hookin'-cough, too. Get every measly thing he can think
  of. Even got a grouch against the Flower of the Ranch-oh!" Her voice was
  crooningly soft and sweet, as if she were murmuring over a sleepy baby.</p>

  <p>Ward closed his eyes, opened them, and looked up into her face. One hand
  came up uncertainly and caught her fingers closely. "Wilhemina-mine!" he
  said, in his hoarse voice. His eyes cleared to sanity under her touch.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise drew a small sigh of relief and reached unobtrusively with
  her free hand for the gun. She slid it down away from his fingers, and when
  he still paid no attention, she picked it up quite openly and laid it against
  the footboard. Ward did not say anything. He seemed altogether occupied with
  the amazing reality of her presence. He clung to her fingers and looked at
  her with that intent stare of his, as if he were trying to hold her there by
  the sheer power of his will.</p>

  <p>"Well, how am I going to doctor you and feed you and make you all comfy,
  with one hand?" asked Billy Louise with quavering flippancy.</p>

  <p>"Kiss me!"</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;might catch the hookin'-cough," bantered Billy Louise, leaning a
  bit closer.</p>

  <p>"Kiss me!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, I s'pose sick folks have to be humored." Billy Louise leaned
  closer still. "Mighty few kissy places left," she observed with the same
  shaky flippancy, a minute later. "Say, Ward, you look for all the world like
  old Sourdough Williams!" Sourdough Williams, it may be remarked, was a
  particularly hairy and unkempt individual who lived a more or less nomadic
  life in the hills, trapping.</p>

  <p>"You look like&mdash;" Ward groped foggily for a simile. Angel was
  altogether too commonplace.</p>

  <p>"Like the lady who's going to get busy right now, making you well. What
  have you been doing to yourself? Never mind; I don't want you talking
  yourself crazy again. Do you know you tried to shoot me up when I came in?
  And you made me start in to write a record of my sins. But that's all right,
  seeing you've got the hookin'-cough, I'll forgive you this once. Lie
  still&mdash;and let go my hand. I want to put a wet cloth on your head."</p>

  <p>"Did I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You did; and then some. Forget it. You've got a terrible cold; and from
  the looks of things, you've had it for about six months." Her eyes went
  comprehensively about that end of the cabin, with the depleted cracker-box,
  the half-emptied boxes of peaches and tomatoes, and the buckets that were all
  but empty of water. She was shocked at the pitiful evidence of long
  helplessness. She did not quite understand. Surely Ward's cold had not kept
  him in bed so long.</p>

  <p>"Well, this is no time for mirth or laughter," she said briskly, to hide
  how close she was to hysteria, "since it looks very much like 'the morning
  after.' First, we've got to tackle that fever of yours." She picked up a
  water-pail and started for the door. As she passed the foot of the bunk, she
  confiscated the two revolvers and took them outside with her. She had no
  desire to be mistaken again for Buck Olney.</p>

  <p>When she came back, Ward's eyes were wild again, and he started up in bed
  and glared at her. Billy Louise laughed at him and told him to lie down like
  a nice buckaroo, and Ward, recalled to himself by her voice, obeyed. She got
  the wash-basin and a towel and prepared to bathe his head. He wanted a drink.
  And when she held a cup to his lips and saw how greedily he drank, a little
  sob broke unexpectedly from her lips. She gritted her teeth after it and
  forced a laugh.</p>

  <p>"You're sure a hard drinker," she bantered and wet her handkerchief to lay
  on his brow.</p>

  <p>"That's the first decent drink I've had for a month," he told her,
  dropping back to the pillow, refreshed to the point of clear thinking. "Old
  Lady Fortune's still playing football with me, William. I've been laid up
  with a broken leg for about six weeks. And when I got gay and thought I could
  handle myself again, I put myself out of business for awhile, and caught this
  cold before I came to and crawled back into bed. I'm&mdash;sure glad you
  showed up, old girl. I was&mdash;getting up against it for fair." He
  coughed.</p>

  <p>"Looks like it." Billy Louise held herself rigidly back from any emotional
  expression. She could not afford to "go to pieces" now. She tried to think
  just what a trained nurse would do, in such a case. Her hospital experience
  would be of some use here, she told herself. She remembered reading somewhere
  that no experience is valueless, if one only applies the knowledge
  gained.</p>

  <p>"First," she said cheerfully, "the patient must be kept quiet and
  cheerful. So don't go jumping up and down on your broken leg, Ward Warren;
  the nurse forbids it. And smile, if it kills you."</p>

  <p>Ward grinned appreciatively. Sick as he was, he realized the gameness of
  Billy Louise; what he failed to realize was the gameness of himself. "I'm a
  pretty worthless specimen, right now," he said apologetically. "But I'm yours
  to command, Bill-the-Conk. You're the doctor."</p>

  <p>"Nope, I'm the cook, right now. I've got a hunch. How would you like a cup
  of tea, patient?"</p>

  <p>"I'd rather have coffee&mdash;Doctor William."</p>

  <p>"Tea, you mean. I'll have it ready in ten minutes." Then she weakened
  before his imploring eyes. "You really oughtn't to drink coffee, with that
  fever, Ward. But, maybe if I don't make it very strong and put in lots of
  cream&mdash; We'll take a chance, buckaroo!"</p>

  <p>Ward watched her as intently as if his life depended on her speed. He had
  lain in that bunk for nearly six weeks with the coffee-pot sitting in plain
  sight on the back of the stove, twelve feet or so from his reach, and with
  the can of coffee standing in plain sight on the rough board shelf against
  the wall by the window. And he had craved coffee almost as badly as a
  drunkard craves whisky.</p>

  <p>The sound of the fire snapping in the stove was like music to him. Later,
  the smell of the coffee coming briskly to the boiling-point made his mouth
  water with desire. And when Billy Louise jabbed two little slits in a cream
  can with the point of a butcher knife and poured a thin stream of canned milk
  into a big, white granite cup, Ward's eyes turned traitor to his love for the
  girl and dwelt hungrily upon the swift movements of her hands.</p>

  <p>"How much sugar, patient?" Billy Louise turned toward him with the
  tomato-can sugar-bowl in her hands.</p>

  <p>"None. I want to taste the coffee, this trip."</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right! It's the worst thing you could think of, but that's the
  way with a patient. Patients always want what they mustn't have."</p>

  <p>"Sure&mdash;get it, too." Ward spoke between long, satisfying gulps.
  "How's your other patient, Wilhemina? How's mommie?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Ward! She's dead&mdash;mommie's dead!" Billy Louise broke down
  unexpectedly and completely. She went down on her knees beside the bed and
  cried as she had not cried since she looked the last time at mommie's still
  face, held in that terrifying calm. She cried until Ward's excited mutterings
  warned her that she must pull herself together. She did, somehow, in spite of
  her sorrow and her worry and that day's succession of emotional shocks. She
  did it because Ward was sick&mdash;very sick, she was afraid&mdash;and there
  was so much that she must do for him.</p>

  <p>"You be s-still," she commanded brokenly, fighting for her former safe
  cheerfulness. "I'm all right. Pity yourself, if you've got to pity somebody.
  I&mdash;can stand&mdash;my trouble. I haven't got any broken leg
  and&mdash;hookin'-cough." She managed a laugh then and took Ward's hand from
  her hair and laid it down on the blankets. "Now we won't talk about things
  any more. You've got to have something done for that cold on your lungs." She
  rose and stood looking down at him with puckered eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Mommie would say you ought to have a good sweat," she decided. "Got any
  ginger?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno. I guess not," Ward muttered confusedly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll go out and find some sage, then, and give you sage tea. That's
  another cure-all. Say, Ward, I saw Rattler down the creek. He's looking fine
  and dandy. He came whinnying down out of that draw, to meet us; just tickled
  to death to see somebody."</p>

  <p>"Don't blame him," croaked Ward. "It's enough to tickle anybody." Her
  voice seemed to steady his straying fancies. "How're&mdash;the
  cattle&mdash;looking?"</p>

  <p>"Just fine," lied Billy Louise. "You're the skinniest thing I've seen on
  the ranch. Now do you think you can keep your senses, while I go and pick
  some nice, good meddy off a sage bush?"</p>

  <p>"I guess so." Ward spoke drowsily. "Give me some more coffee and I
  can."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're the pesteringest patient! I told you coffee isn't good for
  what ails you, but I suppose&mdash;" She poured him another cup of coffee,
  weakened it with hot water, and let him drink it straight. After all, perhaps
  the hot drink would induce the perspiration that would break the fever. She
  pulled up the wolf-skins and the extra blankets he had tossed aside in his
  feverish restlessness and covered him to his chin.</p>

  <p>"If you don't move till I come back," she promised, "I'll maybe give you
  another cup&mdash;after you've filled up on sage tea." With that qualified
  hope to cheer him, she left him.</p>

  <p>She did not spend all her time picking sage twigs. A bush grew at the
  corner of the cabin within easy reach. She went first down to the stable and
  led Blue inside and unsaddled him. Rattler was standing near, and she tried
  to lead him in also, but he fled from her approach. She found the pitchfork
  and managed to scratch a few forkfuls of hay down from a corner of the stack;
  enough to fill a manger for Blue and to leave a little heap beside the stable
  for Rattler.</p>

  <p>When she was leaving the stable to return to the house, however, she
  changed her plan a little. She went back, carried the small pile of hay into
  the stable, and filled another manger. Then she took down the wire gate of
  the hay corral and laid it flat alongside the fence. Rattler would go in to
  the stack, and she would shut him in. That would simplify the catching of him
  when he was needed. She would find something in which to carry water to him,
  if he was too frisky to lead to the creek. Billy Louise was no coward with
  horses, but she recognized certain fixed limitations in the management of a
  snuffy brute like Rattler. He was not like Blue, whom she could bully and
  tease and coax. Rattler was distinctly a man's saddle-horse. Billy Louise had
  never done more than pat his shoulder after he was caught and saddled and,
  therefore, prepared for handling. She foresaw some perturbation of spirit in
  regard to Rattler.</p>

  <p>Ward was lying quiet when she went in, except that he was waving her
  handkerchief to and fro by the corners to cool it. Billy Louise took it from
  him, wet it again with cold water, and scolded him for getting his arms from
  under the covers. That, she said, was no nice way for a hookin'-cough man to
  do.</p>

  <p>Ward meekly submitted to being covered to his eyes. Then he wriggled his
  chin free and demanded that she kiss him. Ward was fairly drunk with
  happiness because she was there, in the cabin. The dreary weeks behind him
  were a nightmare to be forgotten. His Wilhemina-mine was there, and she liked
  him to pieces. Though she had not affirmed it with words, her eyes when she
  looked at him told him so; and she had kissed him when he asked her to. He
  wanted her to repeat the ecstasy.</p>

  <p>"Ward Warren, you're a perfectly awful hookin'-cough man! There. Now
  that's going to be the very last one&mdash; Oh, Ward, it isn't!" She knelt
  and curved an arm around his face and kissed him again and yet again. "I do
  love you, Ward. I've been a weak-kneed, horrid thing, and I'm ashamed to the
  middle of my bones. You're my own brave buckaroo always&mdash;always! You've
  done what no other man would do, and you don't whine about it; and I've been
  weak and&mdash;horrid; and I'll have to love you about a million years before
  I can quit feeling ashamed." She kissed him again with a passion of remorse
  for her doubts of him.</p>

  <p>"Are you through being pals, Wilhemina?" Ward broke rules and freed an
  arm, so that he could hold her closer.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm just beginning. Just beginning right. I'm your pal for keeps.
  But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I love you for keeps, lady mine." Ward stifled another cough. "When are
  you going to&mdash;marry me?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, when you get over the hookin'-cough, I s'pose." Once more Billy
  Louise, for the good of her patient, forced herself into safe
  flippancy&mdash;that was not flippant at all, but merely a tender
  pretense.</p>

  <p>"Now it's up to you to show me whether you are in any hurry at all to get
  well," she said. "Keep your hands under the covers while I make some tea.
  That fever of yours has got to be stopped immediately&mdash;at once."</p>

  <p>She went over and busied herself about the stove, never once looking
  toward the bed, though she must have felt Ward's eyes worshiping her. She was
  terribly worried about Ward; so worried that she put everything else into the
  background of her mind and set herself sternly to the need of breaking the
  fever and lessening the evident congestion in his lungs.</p>

  <p>She hunted through the cupboards and found a bottle of turpentine; syrupy
  and yellowed with age, but pungent with strength. She found some lard in a
  small bucket and melted half a teacupful. Then she tore up a woolen
  undershirt she found hanging on a nail and bore relentlessly down upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"You gotta be greased all over your lungs," she announced with a
  matter-of-factness that cost her something; for Billy Louise's innate modesty
  was only just topped by her good sense.</p>

  <p>Ward submitted without protest while she bared his chest&mdash;as white as
  her own&mdash;and applied the warm mixture with a smoothly vigorous palm.
  "That'll fix the hookin'-cough," she said, as she spread the warm layers of
  woolen cloth smoothly from shoulder to shoulder. "How does it feel?"</p>

  <p>"Great," he assured her succinctly, and wisely omitted any
  love-making.</p>

  <p>"Will your game leg let you turn over? Because there's some dope left, and
  it ought to go between your shoulders."</p>

  <p>"The game leg ought to stand more than that," he told her, turning slowly.
  "If I hadn't got this cold tacked onto me, I'd have been trying to walk on it
  by now."</p>

  <p>"Better give it time&mdash;since you've been game enough to lie here all
  this while and take care of it. I don't believe I'd have had nerve enough for
  that, Ward." She poured turpentine and lard into her palm, reached inside his
  collar and rubbed it on his shoulders. "Good thing you had plenty of grub
  handy. But it must have been awful!"</p>

  <p>"It was pretty damned lonesome," he admitted laconically, and that was as
  far as his complainings went.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise then poured the water off the sage leaves she had been
  brewing in a tin basin, carefully fished out a stem or two, and made Ward
  drink every bitter drop. Then she covered him to the eyes and hardened her
  heart against his discomfort, while she kept the handkerchief cool on his
  head and between times swept the floor with a carefully dampened broom and
  wiped the dust off things and restored the room to its most cheerful
  atmosphere of livableness.</p>

  <p>"Wan' a drink," mumbled Ward, with a blanket over his mouth and a raveled
  thread tickling his nose so that he squirmed.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise went over and laid her fingers on his neck. "I can't tell
  whether it's grease or perspiration," she said, laughing a little. "What are
  you squinting up your nose for? Surely to goodness you don't mind that
  little, harmless raveling? If you wouldn't go on breathing, it wouldn't
  wiggle around so much!" Nevertheless, she plucked the tormenting thread and
  threw it on the floor.</p>

  <p>"Gimme&mdash;drink," Ward mumbled again.</p>

  <p>"There's more sage tea&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Waugh!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose that means you aren't crazy about sage tea! Well, I might give
  you a teenty-weenty speck more of coffee. You can't have water yet, you know.
  You've&mdash;you've got to sweat like a nigger in a cotton patch first."
  (Billy Louise could talk very nicely when she wanted to do so. The Billy of
  her could also be humanly inelegant when she felt like it, as you see.) Ward
  grunted something and afterwards signified that he would take the coffee and
  call it square.</p>

  <p>The next time she went near him, he was wrinkling his lean nose because
  beads of perspiration were standing there and slipping occasionally down to
  his cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Fine! You're two niggers in a cotton patch now," she announced
  cheeringly. "And Mr. Hookin'-cough will have to hunt another home, I reckon.
  You weren't half as hoarse when you swore that last time."</p>

  <p>It was physically impossible for Ward to blush, since he was already the
  color of a boiled beet; but he looked guilty when she uncovered the rest of
  his face and wiped off the gathered moisture. "I didn't think you'd hear," he
  grinned embarrassedly.</p>

  <p>"I was listening for it, buckaroo. I'd have been scared to pieces if you
  hadn't cussed a little. I'd have thought sure you were going to die. A man,"
  she added sententiously, "always has a chance as long as he's able to swear.
  It's like a horse wiggling his ears."</p>

  <p>The comparison reminded her that she intended to shut Rattler in the hay
  corral; she dried Ward's hands hastily, pulled the wolf-skins off the bed,
  and commanded him to keep covered until she came back. She ran down
  bareheaded to the stable, saw Rattler industriously boring his nose into the
  stack, and put up the gate.</p>

  <p>When she went into the cabin again, Ward gave a start and opened his eyes
  like one who has been dozing. Billy Louise smiled with gratification. He was
  better. She knew he was better. She did not speak, but went over to the stove
  and pretended to be busy there, though she was careful to make no noise. When
  she turned finally and glanced toward the bed, Ward was asleep.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise took a deep breath, tiptoed over to the bench beside the
  table, sat down, and pillowed her head on her folded arms. She wanted to cry,
  and she needed to think, and she was deadly, deadly tired.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; THE WOLF JOKE</h2>

  <p class="first">BILLY LOUISE stayed all night. She was afraid to leave Ward
  until his cold was safely better, and there was no one living near enough to
  summon; no one whom she wanted to summon, in fact, however close they might
  have been. She spent most of the night curled comfortably on the wolf-skins
  beside the stove, with a sack of flour for a pillow and Ward's fur coat for
  covering. Ward slept more unbrokenly than he had done for a long time, while
  Billy Louise lay cuddled under the smelly fur and thought and thought.</p>

  <p>In the morning, if Ward were well enough, she meant to ask him about those
  cattle he had mentioned when he thought her Buck Olney. They were the same
  ones which she had seen in the Cove, she knew. Ward had told enough to prove
  that. He had, in fact, told nearly all she needed to know&mdash;except the
  mystery of his prosperity. He had not mentioned that, and Billy Louise was
  more curious than ever about his "wolf hunting."</p>

  <p>At sunrise she rebuilt the fire and made fresh coffee and a stew from the
  pieces of jerky she had soaked overnight for the purpose. She wanted eggs,
  and bread for toast, and fresh cream; but she did not have them, and so she
  managed a very creditable breakfast for her patient without these
  desirables.</p>

  <p>"Say, that's great. A fellow doesn't appreciate coffee and warm food until
  he's eaten out of cans and boxes for a month or so. You're a great little
  lady, Wilhemina. I wish you'd happened along sooner&mdash;about six weeks
  sooner. I'd have got some pleasure out of my broken leg then, maybe."</p>

  <p>"Was it&mdash;did Buck Olney break it?" Billy Louise knew he had not, but
  she had been waiting for a chance to open the subject.</p>

  <p>"No. I broke it myself, pulling Rattler off a bank into some rocks. I
  believe I could walk on it, doctor, if you could rustle me something to use
  for crutches. That's what held me in bed so long. Reckon you could
  manufacture a pair for me?" His eyes made love. "You've done everything
  else." He caught her hand and kissed the palm of it. "Can't the Billy part
  turn carpenter?"</p>

  <p>"I'll see. Say, Ward, do you think you could shave off those whiskers if I
  got everything ready for you? I don't like you to look like old Sourdough. Or
  maybe I could do it. I&mdash;I used to shave daddy's neck, sometimes."</p>

  <p>Ward ran his fingers thoughtfully over his hairy cheeks. "I expect I do
  look like a prehistoric ancestor. I'll see what I can do about it. I set my
  own leg; I guess I can shave myself. You're a great doctor, Wilhemina. You
  knocked that cold up to a peak, all right. But&mdash;I don't believe you'd
  better tackle barbering, my dear girl."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise pouted her lips at him. She could afford to pout now: Ward
  was so like himself that she did not worry over him at all. She also felt
  that she could afford to badger him into telling her some of the things she
  wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"Where did you hang Buck?" she asked naively.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Ward's eyes bored into hers with his intent look, trying to read
  her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Where was it you hanged Buck Olney?"</p>

  <p>"Nowhere. I put the fear of the Lord into him, that's all. How did you
  hear about it?"</p>

  <p>"From you." Billy Louise was maddeningly calm. "You told me all about it
  yesterday. And about those cattle in the corral up here. I found them
  yesterday myself, Ward&mdash;only it seems a month ago!&mdash;down in the
  Cove."</p>

  <p>"Did you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I drove them up to the corral and read the riot act to Marthy
  and Charlie Fox&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Huh! What did they say?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, they denied it, of course! What are we going to do about it,
  Ward?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, I guess. What did you want to do?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I don't want to hurt them, and I don't want them to hurt
  anyone else. Do you know Seabeck? He's an awfully square old fellow. I
  believe&mdash;" An idea formed vaguely in the back of Billy Louise's mind. "I
  believe I could persuade him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I believe you could persuade the devil himself, if you took a notion to
  try," Ward affirmed sincerely, when she hesitated. "What do you want to
  persuade him into?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing, I guess! How do you feel, Ward? We've got to stick to the
  job of getting you fit to leave here and go on down to the ranch with me.
  When do you think you could manage to ride?"</p>

  <p>Ward looked longingly out of the window, just as he had been looking for
  six weeks. "I think I could manage it now," he said doggedly, because of his
  great longing. "I set my own leg&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I'm willing to admit you're a wonder, and have gotten the stoics
  beaten at their own game. Still, there's a limit to what the human body will
  stand. I'm going down to tend the horses, and if you think you can walk
  without hurting your leg, I'll hunt some forked sticks for crutches. We'll
  see how you make out with them, first, before we talk about riding twenty
  miles on horseback. Besides, you'd catch more cold if you went out
  to-day."</p>

  <p>While she talked, her plans took definite shape in the back of her mind.
  She took Buck Olney's knife that was lying on the window-sill and went in
  search of crutches among the willows along the creek. Forked sticks were
  plentiful enough, but it was not so easy to find two that would support even
  so skinny a man as Ward. She compromised by cutting four that seemed suitable
  and binding them together in couples.</p>

  <p>When she went in with her makeshifts, Ward was sitting upon the side of
  the bunk, clothed and in his right mind&mdash;but pitifully wobbly and
  ashamed of his weakness.</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't have tried to get up yet," she scolded. "Do you want to be
  worse, so I'll have to cure you all over again?" Then, woman-like, she
  proceeded to annul the effect by petting and sympathy.</p>

  <p>It was while she was sitting in the one chair, padding the sticks crudely
  enough but effectively, that Ward, gazing at her with the light of love in
  his eyes, thought of something he had meant to tell her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, by the way, I've got something for you, Wilhemina," he said. "Put
  down that thing and come over here. I want to shave before I take a try at
  walking, anyway. See here, lady-mine. How would you like these strung on a
  gold chain?"</p>

  <p>From under his pillow he drew out a tobacco sack and emptied the contents
  into her palm. "Those are your Christmas present, Bill-Loo. Like 'em?"</p>

  <p>"Do I!" Billy Louise held up the biggest one and stared at it round-eyed.
  "Gold nuggets! Where in the world&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's what I'm going to tell you&mdash;now you're through being just
  pals. Oh, I'd have told you, anyway, I reckon, only the play never came
  right, after that first little squabble we had over it." He put an arm around
  her, pulled her down beside him, and rubbed his bristly chin over her hair.
  "That's the wolf joke, William. I did make a lot of money wolfing&mdash;on
  the square. I dug out a den of pups and struck a little pocket of pretty rich
  gravel. I've been busy panning it out all the time I could spare, till the
  creek froze up."</p>

  <p>"You found a gold mine?" Billy Louise gasped. "Why, whoever would have
  thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I wouldn't call it a gold mine, exactly," he hastened to assure her,
  before her imagination dazzled her. "There isn't enough of it. It's just a
  pocket. I've cleaned up about eighteen hundred dollars, this summer, besides
  these nuggets. Maybe more. And there's some left yet. I found both ends of
  the streak; it lies along a ledge on the side of a gully. I couldn't find
  anything except in that one streak of gravel; and when that's gone she's
  done, as near as I can figure. But it isn't all gone yet, lady mine. There's
  enough left to pay the preacher, anyway. That big fellow I found along toward
  the last, just before I quit working." He kissed her gravely. "Poor old girl!
  She's dead game, all right, and she's kind of had the cards stacked against
  her from the start. But things are going to come easier from now on, if I'm
  any prophet. It's too bad&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Billy Louise read his thought.</p>

  <p>"Mommie looked so peaceful, Ward. At the last, I mean. If I could have
  waked her up, I don't believe I'd have had the heart to do it. She never was
  very happy; you know that. She couldn't seem to see the happiness in little
  things. So many are like that. And she looked happier&mdash;at the
  last&mdash;than I ever saw her look before. So&mdash;I'm happier,
  too&mdash;since yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Are you?" Ward dropped his face against her hair and held it there for a
  minute. It was not his cold altogether that had made his voice break hoarsely
  over those two words.</p>

  <p>"Do you know&mdash;" Billy Louise was lifting the nuggets one after the
  other and letting them drop to her lap&mdash;"happiness is like gold, Ward.
  We've got to pan it out of life ourselves. If we try to steal it from someone
  else, we pay the penalty, don't you think? And so many go looking and looking
  for great big chunks of it all&mdash;all&mdash;whatever they do to it." She
  laughed a little at her ignorance of the technical process. "You see what I
  mean, don't you? We get a streak of gravel; that's life. And we can pan out
  happiness if we try&mdash;little nuggets and sometimes just colors&mdash;but
  it keeps us hoping and working."</p>

  <p>"Doctor of philosophy!" Ward kissed her hair. "You're a great little girl,
  all right. And I'm the buckaroo that has struck a mighty rich streak of pay
  dirt in life, Wilhemina. I'm panning out happiness millions to the pan right
  now."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise, attacked with a spasm of shyness, went abruptly back to
  padding the makeshift crutches and changed the subject.</p>

  <p>"I'm going home, soon as I fix you comfy," she said.</p>

  <p>Whereupon Ward protested most strenuously and did not look in the least
  like a man who has just announced himself a millionaire in happiness.</p>

  <p>"What for?" he demanded, after he had exhausted himself to no purpose in
  telling her that she should not leave the cabin until he could go along.</p>

  <p>"I want eggs&mdash;for you, you ungrateful beast. And some bread for
  toast. And I want to tell Phoebe and John where I am."</p>

  <p>"You think those Injuns are going to hurt themselves worrying? I don't
  want any eggs and toast. I've managed all right on crackers and jerky for six
  weeks, so I guess I can stand it a few hours longer. Still, if you're crazy
  to go&mdash;" He dropped back on the pillow and turned his face away.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise worked silently until she had made the crutches as soft on
  top as she could. Then she hunted for Ward's razor and shaving-cup and after
  one or two failures&mdash;through using too much water&mdash;she managed to
  make a cup of very nice lather.</p>

  <p>"Now, buckaroo, don't be a sulky kid," she said, firmly as she could. "You
  know it's hard enough for me to go off and leave you here like this. But, as
  you say, you've managed to get along for six weeks without me, so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sure. I could do it again, I reckon." Ward turned a gloomy pair of eyes
  upon her. "What's the rush? Do you think it isn't proper&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's always proper to do what is right and helpful and kind," said Billy
  Louise with dignity, because she had made up her mind and was trying not to
  weaken. "I've lived in this country all my life, and I guess my reputation
  will stand this little strain," she went on lightly, "even if anyone finds it
  out. I've got to go, that's all. Those people in the Cove&mdash;" It was
  eloquent of her stern justice that she could not bring herself to speak them
  by name.</p>

  <p>"You aren't going to turn them over to the sheriff, are you, William? Good
  Lord, girl! If I can&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your lather is getting cold," Billy Louise said evenly. "I ought to have
  known better than mention the subject at all. I'm going to do what's right. I
  believe I have some faint idea of right and wrong, Ward Warren. And I'm not
  going to do anything that I don't feel is right, or anything that I'll be
  sorry for. You might trust me, I think. It's early yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll come back before night, won't you?" From his tone, Ward had
  yielded the point&mdash;and was minded to yield with what graciousness he
  could command. It had occurred to him that he was behaving like a selfish
  booby. Billy Louise should not call him weak-kneed; whatever happened.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think I can, Ward. I might send John."</p>

  <p>"You needn't bother. I don't want John."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't suppose he would be much comfort. I'll make a pot of
  coffee, Ward, and I'll fill the lantern and fix it so you can heat a cup when
  you want to; how will that be?" She brightened a little at the idea. "And
  I'll fix your lungs up again before I go and bake some nice, hot biscuits and
  put here, and butter, and fix you just as comfy as possible. Or, if you can
  manage to get around with the crutches, all the better. I'll leave things so
  you won't have to go outside for a thing.</p>

  <p>"And, Ward"&mdash;she bent over him anxiously&mdash;"I'm going because I
  must. For all our sakes I must go right away. And I'll come back to-morrow
  just as early as I can get here. So if you are real good, and take care of
  your cold, and get a little strong about walking, you can go back with me.
  And to-morrow night you can sit in daddy's chair before the fireplace, and
  we'll have chicken and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;all right!" Ward laughed suddenly. "Will you give me a
  lump of sugar and let me look at all the pitty pittys in the album? Oh, you
  William the Conqueror!" He caught her close, when he saw that he had hurt her
  feelings a little, and held her a minute. "When I get two good legs under me,
  Wilhemina," he promised softly, "I'm going to stake myself to the job of
  taking care of you. Your cheeks are pretty thin, little lady-girl. Damn the
  luck, anyway!"</p>

  <p>"Here's the lather. I'm going down and saddle up," said Billy Louise.
  "When I come back, we'll see how the crutches work."</p>

  <p>"Oh, say!" Ward called after her. "My saddle's behind a buck bush up along
  the trail where the bank is cut straight. I forgot about that. And would you
  mind bringing the looking-glass, William? How the deuce do you think a man's
  going to shave without a glass? And that old paper to wipe the lather on,
  while you're at it. I see the Billy of you hasn't got to the shaving-point
  yet, at any rate!"</p>

  <p>Billy Louise took down the glass and flung it on the bed, threw the
  newspaper after it, and departed with her chin in the air to find his saddle
  and bridle and carry them to the stable.</p>

  <p>Ward, sitting up in bed, stared at the closed door remorsefully. When he
  was convinced that she did not intend to return even for the last word which
  is so tempting to a woman, he reached for the glass, held it up, and looked
  within.</p>

  <p>"Sufferin' saddle blankets!" he grunted and dropped the glass. "And she
  could kiss a mug like that!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; "HM-MM!"</h2>

  <p class="first">FLOYD CARSON was a somewhat phlegmatic young man, but he
  swore an astonished oath when he saw Billy Louise galloping along the lane
  that led nowhere except to the womanless abode of Samuel Seabeck. He walked
  very fast to the stable, which was the first logical stopping-place, and so
  he met Billy Louise before she had time to dismount, even supposing she
  intended to do so.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Floyd! Is Mr. Seabeck at home?" Billy Louise was not one to waste
  time in the superfluities of speech when she had anything on her mind.</p>

  <p>"Sure. Get off, and I'll put up your horse. We're just through eatin', but
  our grub carpenter will rustle something for yuh, all right."</p>

  <p>"No, I can't stop this time. I'm not hungry, anyway. Just give a yell for
  Mr. Seabeck, will you? I want to see him a minute."</p>

  <p>Floyd eyed her uncertainly, decided that Billy Louise was not in the mood
  to yield to persuasion, and tactfully hurried off to find Seabeck without
  shouting for him&mdash;lest he bring others also, who were evidently not
  wanted at all. He took it that Billy Louise felt some diffidence about
  visiting a strictly bachelor outfit, and he set himself to relieve her of any
  embarrassment.</p>

  <p>Presently Seabeck himself came from the dirt-roofed, rambling cabin which
  was his home and strode down the path, buttoning his coat as he came. Floyd's
  face showed for a minute in the doorway before he effaced himself completely,
  and not another man was in sight anywhere. Billy Louise was grateful to
  circumstance; she had dreaded this visit, though not for the reason Floyd
  Carson believed.</p>

  <p>"How de do, Miss MacDonald? Pretty nice day, but I'm afraid it's a
  weather-breeder. The wind's trying to change, I notice."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and so I mustn't stop. Could you ride part way home with me, Mr.
  Seabeck? I&mdash;want to talk with you about something. And I can't stop a
  minute. I must get home."</p>

  <p>"Why, certainly, I'll go. If you'll wait just a minute while I saddle
  up&mdash;or if you'd rather ride on, I'll overtake you."</p>

  <p>"I'll ride on, I think. Blue hates standing around, and he's a little
  warm, too. You're awfully good, Mr. Seabeck&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not at all!" Seabeck stubbed his toe on the stable doorsill in his
  confusion at the praise. "I'll be right along, soon as I can slap a saddle
  on." He disappeared, and Billy Louise turned and loped slowly down the
  lane.</p>

  <p>So far, so good. Billy Louise tried to believe that it was all going to be
  as plain sailing as this fortuitous beginning, but she was aware of a nervous
  fluttering in her throat while she waited, and she knew that she positively
  dreaded hearing Seabeck gallop up behind her on the frozen trail. "Why will
  people do things that make a lot of trouble for others?" she cried out
  petulantly. And then she heard the steady <i>pluck, pluckety-pluck</i> of
  Seabeck's horse, and twisted her lips with a whimsical acceptance of the part
  she had set herself to play. She might smash things, she told herself, but at
  the worst it would be only a premature smash. "Come, Bill," she adjured
  herself, pretending it was what Ward would have said, had he looked into her
  mind. "Be a Bill-the-Conk&mdash;and a good one! Shove in your chips and play
  for all there is in it."</p>

  <p>"You must have some lightning method of saddling, Mr. Seabeck," she smiled
  over her shoulder at him when he came up.</p>

  <p>"We learn to do things quick when we've handled cattle a few years," he
  admitted. He had a diffident manner of receiving compliments which pleased
  Billy Louise and gave her confidence a needed brace. She was not a skilled
  coquette; she was too honest and too straightforward for that. Still, nature
  places certain weapons in the hands of a woman, and instinct shows her how to
  use them. Seabeck, from his very unaccustomedness to women, seemed to her
  particularly pliable. Billy Louise took her courage in both hands and went
  straight to the point.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Seabeck, I've always heard that you're an awfully square man," she
  said. "Daddy seemed to think that you could be depended on in any kind of a
  pinch. I hope it's true. I'm banking a lot on your squareness to-day."</p>

  <p>"Why, I don't know about my being any better than my neighbors," he said,
  with a twinkle of humor in his eyes, which were a bright, unvarying blue.
  "But you can bank on my doing anything I can for you, Miss MacDonald. I think
  I could be even better than square&mdash;to help a plucky little girl
  who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't mean just the ordinary squareness," Billy Louise put in quietly.
  "I mean bigness, too; a bigness that will make a man be more than square; a
  bigness that will let him see all around a thing and judge it from a bigger
  viewpoint than mere justice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hm-mm&mdash;if you could trust me enough to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to, Mr. Seabeck. I'm going to take it for granted you're bigger
  than your own squareness. And if you're not&mdash;if you're just a selfish,
  weak, letter-perfect, honest man, I'll&mdash;feel like&mdash;thrashing you."
  Without a doubt that was the Billy of her which spoke.</p>

  <p>"I'll take the thrashing if you think I need it," he promised, looking at
  her with something more than admiration. "What have you done, Miss MacDonald?
  If I can help you hide the body&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There!" Billy Louise dared to wrinkle her nose at him&mdash;and I don't
  know which of her did it. "I knew you'd play up like a good sport. But what
  if it isn't a body? What if&mdash;what if you found some of your cattle
  with&mdash;with a big D&mdash;run over your brand?" She had a perfectly white
  line around her mouth and nostrils then, but she faced him squarely.</p>

  <p>"Hm-mm!" Seabeck gave her a quick, sidewise glance and pulled thoughtfully
  at the graying whiskers that pointed his chin. "I would have been glad to
  lend you money, or help you in any way."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know." Billy Louise snapped her reins impatiently. "But what would
  you do about the&mdash;cattle?"</p>

  <p>"What could I do? What would you want me to do? I should do whatever would
  help you. I would&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Would you&mdash;be as ready to help somebody else? Somebody
  I&mdash;thought a&mdash;lot&mdash;of?"</p>

  <p>Seabeck, evidently, saw light. He cleared his throat and spat gravely into
  a bush. "I see you don't trust me, after all," he said.</p>

  <p>"I do. I've got to; I mean, I'd have to whether I did or not. It's like
  this, Mr. Seabeck. It isn't the big D brand; of course you knew it couldn't
  be. But it isn't yours, either. Someone was tempted and was weak. They're
  sorry now. They want to do the right thing, and it rests with you whether
  they can do it. You can shut them up in jail if you like; you have a perfect
  right to do it. Some men would do that and be able to sleep after it, I
  suppose. But I believe you're bigger than that. I believe you're big enough
  to see that if a person goes wrong and then sees the mistake and wants to
  pull back into the straight trail, a man&mdash;even the one who has been
  wronged&mdash;would be committing a moral crime to prevent it. To take a
  person who wants to make a fresh, honest start, and shut that person up
  amongst criminals and brand him as a criminal, seems to me a worse wrong than
  to steal a few head of cattle; don't you think so, Mr. Seabeck?"</p>

  <p>What Mr. Seabeck thought did not immediately appear in speech. He was
  pulling a little harder at his whiskers and staring at the ears of his
  horse.</p>

  <p>"That would depend on the person," he said at last. "Some men are born
  criminals."</p>

  <p>"Oh, we aren't talking about that kind of a man. Surely to goodness you
  don't call Charlie Fox a born criminal, or Marthy Meilke?"</p>

  <p>"Charlie Fox! Is that the person you mean, who has been&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is! And he is horribly sorry, and so is Marthy, and they'll pay
  you for the cattle. And if you do anything mean about it, it will simply kill
  poor old Marthy. You couldn't send her to the pen, Mr. Seabeck. Think how
  she's worked there in the Cove; and Charlie has worked like a perfect slave;
  and he was trying to get a start so he&mdash;could&mdash;get
  married&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hm-mm!" Rumors had reached Seabeck, thanks to Billy Louise's dropped
  lashes upon a certain occasion, which caused him to believe he saw further
  light.</p>

  <p>"And if you're going to be horrid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will the&mdash;lady he wants to marry give him another chance?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you think she ought to&mdash;if she l-loves him?" Billy Louise
  studied the skyline upon the side farthest from Seabeck.</p>

  <p>"You say he wants to pay for the cattle and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He'll do anything he can to make amends," said Billy Louise, with
  conviction. "He'll take his medicine and go to jail if you insist," she added
  sorrowfully. "It will ruin his whole life, of course, and break a couple of
  women's hearts, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's a bad thing, a mighty bad thing, when a man tries to get ahead too
  fast."</p>

  <p>"It's a good thing when he learns the lesson without having to pay for it
  with his whole future," Billy Louise amended the statement.</p>

  <p>Seabeck smiled a little behind his fingers that kept tugging at his
  whiskers.</p>

  <p>"Did Charlie Fox send Miss Portia&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He doesn't know I had any intention of coming," Billy Louise assured him
  quickly and with perfect truth. "They'll both be awfully surprised when they
  find it out"&mdash;which was also perfectly true&mdash;"and when they see you
  ride up, they'll think you've got the sheriff at your back. I haven't a doubt
  they&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There are a few points I'd like to clear up, if you can help me," Seabeck
  interrupted. "All this rustling that has been going on for the past year and
  a half: are Fox and the Meilke woman mixed up in that? I want," he said, "to
  help the young man&mdash;and her. But if they have been operating on a large
  scale, I'm afraid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I believe Charlie must have been influenced in some ways by bad
  acquaintances," Billy Louise answered more steadily than she felt. "But
  his&mdash;rustling&mdash;has been of a petty kind. I won't apologize for him,
  Mr. Seabeck. I think it's perfectly awful, what he has done. But I think it
  would be more awful still not to give him a chance. The other rustling is
  some outside gang, I'm sure. If Charlie was mixed up with them, it's very
  slightly&mdash;just enough to damn him utterly if he were arrested and tried.
  He isn't a natural criminal. He's just weak. And he's learned his lesson.
  It's up to you, Mr. Seabeck, to say whether he shall have a chance to profit
  by the lesson. And there's poor old Marthy in it, too. She just worships
  Charlie and would do anything&mdash;even steal for him."</p>

  <p>Seabeck meditated for a mile, and Billy Louise watched him uneasily from
  the tail of her eye. To tell the plain truth, she was in a panic of fear at
  what she had done. It had looked so simple and so practicable when she had
  planned it; and now when the words were out and the knowledge had reached
  Seabeck and was beyond her control, she could not think of any good reason
  for telling him.</p>

  <p>Last night, when she lay curled up by the stove under Ward's wolf-skin
  coat, this seemed the only possible way out: To tell Seabeck and trust to his
  kindness and generosity to refrain from pushing the case. To have Charlie Fox
  give back what he had stolen or pay for it&mdash;anything that would satisfy
  Seabeck's sense of justice&mdash;and let him start honestly. She had thought
  that Seabeck would be merciful, if she told him in the right way; but now,
  when she stole a glance at his bent, brooding face, she was frightened. He
  did not look merciful, but stern and angry. She remembered then that stealing
  cattle is the one crime a cattleman finds it hard to forgive.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise might have spared herself some mental anguish if she could
  have known that Seabeck was brooding over the wonder of a woman's love that
  pardons and condones a man's sins. He was wishing that such a love as Billy
  Louise's had come to him, and he was wondering how a man could be tempted to
  go wrong when such a girl loved him. He was laboring under a misapprehension,
  of course. Billy Louise had permitted him to misunderstand her interest in
  the matter. If he had known that she was pleading solely for
  Marthy&mdash;poor, avaricious, gray, old Marthy&mdash;perhaps his mercy would
  have been less tinged with that smoldering resentment which was directed not
  so much at the wrongdoer, as at fate which had cheated him.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you came and told me this," he said at last. "Very glad, indeed,
  Miss MacDonald. Certain steps have been taken lately to push this&mdash;wipe
  out this rustling and general lawlessness, and if you had not told me, I'm
  afraid the mills of justice would have ground your&mdash;friends. Of course
  the law would be merciful to Mrs. Meilke. No jury would send an old woman
  like that&mdash; By the way, that breed they have had working for
  them&mdash;he is in the deal, too, I take it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course. They had to have someone to help. Marthy can't do any
  riding." Billy Louise spoke with a dreary apathy that betrayed how the
  reaction had set in. "She stayed in the Cove, in case anyone came prowling
  down there. It seems there's a wire fastened to the gate, and it rings a bell
  down at the house somewhere when the gate is opened. And besides that she had
  a dog that would tackle strangers. I don't believe," she went on, after a
  little silence, "that Marthy would have turned dishonest for herself. She was
  grasping, and all she cared for was getting ahead. It&mdash;sort of grew on
  her, after the years of trying to dig a bare living out of the ground.
  I&mdash;can understand that; and I can see how she would go to any length
  almost for&mdash;Charlie. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, let's not think any more about them until we have to." There was a
  certain crude attempt at soothing her anxieties. "You've trusted me, Miss
  MacDonald. I'll try and not disappoint you in the matter, though, unless they
  are quite separate from the gang which is being run down, it may be hard to
  protect them. Do you know&mdash;whether&mdash;any other cowman has suffered
  from their&mdash;mm-mm&mdash;haste to get rich?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think there's anyone but you," Billy Louise replied
  lifelessly.</p>

  <p>"Hm-mm&mdash;do you know, Miss MacDonald, whether there was any intimacy
  between&mdash;your friends&mdash;and the man we had for stock inspector, Mr.
  Olney?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;can't say, as to that." Billy Louise, you see, did not know much
  about details, but the little she did know made her hedge.</p>

  <p>"There's a queer story about Olney. You know he has left the country,
  don't you? It seems he rode very hurriedly up to the depot at Wilmer to take
  the train. Just as he stepped on, a fellow who knew him by sight noticed a
  piece of paper pinned on the back of his coat. He jerked it loose. It was
  a&mdash;m-m&mdash;very peculiar document for a man to be wearing on his
  back." Seabeck pulled at his whiskers, but it was not the pulling which
  quirked the corners of his lips. "The man said Olney seemed greatly upset
  over something and had evidently forgotten the paper until he felt it being
  pulled loose. He said Olney looked back then, and he was the color of a
  pork-rind. The train was pulling out. The man took the paper over to a saloon
  and let several others read it. They&mdash;mm-mm&mdash;decided that it should
  be placed in the hands of the authorities.
  Have&mdash;m-m&mdash;your&mdash;friends ever mentioned the matter to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Billy Louise, and her eyes were wide.</p>

  <p>"Hm-mm! We must discover, if we can, Miss MacDonald, whether they are in
  any way implicated with this man Olney. I believe that this is at present
  more important than the recovery of any&mdash;m-m&mdash;cattle of mine which
  they may have appropriated."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise looked at him for a minute. "Mr. Seabeck, you're awfully dear
  about this!" she told him. "I haven't been as square as you; and I've
  been&mdash; Listen here, Mr. Seabeck! I don't love Charlie Fox a bit. I love
  somebody else, and I'm going to marry him. He's so square, I'd hate to have
  him think I even let you believe something that wasn't true. It's Marthy I'm
  thinking of, Mr. Seabeck. I was afraid you wouldn't let Charlie off just for
  her sake, but I thought maybe if you just thought I&mdash;wanted you to do it
  for mine, why, maybe&mdash;with two women to be sorry for, you'd kind
  of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hm-mm!" Seabeck sent her a keen, blue, twinkling glance that made Billy
  Louise turn hot all over with shame and penitence. "Hm-mm!" he said
  again&mdash;if one can call that a saying&mdash;and pulled at his graying
  whiskers. "Hm-mmm!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; MARTHY</h2>

  <p class="first">BILLY LOUISE led the way down the gorge, through the meadow,
  and along the orchard to the little gate. The Cove seemed empty and rather
  forlorn, with the wind creeping up the river and rattling the dry branches of
  the naked fruit trees. Not much more than twenty-four hours had slid into the
  past since Billy Louise had galloped away from the place, yet she felt
  vaguely that life had taken a big stride here since she last saw it. Nothing
  was changed, though, as far as she could see. A few cattle fed in the meadow
  next the river, a fattening hog lifted himself from his bed of straw and
  grunted at them as they passed. A few chickens were hunting fishworms in the
  thawed places of the garden, and a yellow cat ran creepingly along the top
  rail of the nearest corral, crouched there with digging claws and pounced
  down into a flock of snowbirds. A drift of dead apple leaves stirred uneasily
  beside the footpath through the berry bushes. Billy Louise started nervously
  and glanced over her shoulder at Seabeck. For some reason she wanted the
  comfort of his presence. She waited until he came up to her&mdash;tall,
  straight like a soldier, and silent as the Cove itself.</p>

  <p>"I'm&mdash;scared," said Billy Louise. She did not smile either when she
  said it. "I&mdash;hate empty-feeling places. I'm&mdash;afraid of
  emptiness."</p>

  <p>"Yet you are always riding alone in the hills." Seabeck looked down at her
  with a puzzled expression in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"The hills aren't empty," she told him impatiently. "They're just big and
  quiet. This is&mdash;" She flung out a hand and did not try to find a word
  for what she felt.</p>

  <p>"Shall I go first? I thought you would rather&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I would." Billy Louise pulled herself together, angry at her sudden
  impulse to run, as she had run from Ward's quiet cabin. She remembered that
  unreasoning panic&mdash;was it really only yesterday?&mdash;and went steadily
  up the path and across the little ditch which Marthy had dug. Why must sordid
  trouble and dull misery hang over a beauty-spot like this? she thought
  resentfully.</p>

  <p>She stopped for a minute on the doorstep, hesitating before she opened the
  door. Behind her, Seabeck drew close as if he would shield her from
  something; perhaps he, too, felt the deadly quiet and emptiness of the
  place.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise opened the door and stepped into the kitchen. She stopped and
  stood still, so that her slim figure would have hidden the interior from the
  eyes of Seabeck had he not been so tall. As it was, she barred his way so
  that he must stand on the step outside.</p>

  <p>By the kitchen table, with her elbows on the soiled oilcloth, sat Marthy.
  Her uncombed hair hung in wisps about her head; her hard old face was lined
  and gray, her hard eyes dull with brooding. Billy Louise, staring at her from
  the doorway, knew that Marthy had been sitting like that for a long, long
  time.</p>

  <p>She went over to her diffidently. Hesitatingly she laid her gauntleted
  hand on Marthy's stooped shoulder. She did not say anything. Marthy did not
  move under her touch, except to turn her dull glance upon Seabeck, standing
  there on the doorstep.</p>

  <p>"C'm in," she said stolidly. "What'd yuh come fer?"</p>

  <p>"Miss MacDonald will perhaps explain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She ain't got nothin' to explain," said hard old Marthy with grim
  finality. "I'll do what explainin's to be done. C'm in. Don't stand there
  like a stump. And shut the door. It's cold as a barn here, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Marthy!" cried Billy Louise, with the sound of tears in her
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Don't oh Marthy me," said the harsh voice flatly. "I don't want no
  Marthyin' nor no sympathy. Well, old man, you're here to colleck, I s'pose.
  Take what's in sight; 'tain't none of it yourn, far's I know, but anything
  you claim you kin have, fer all me. I've lived honest all my days an' worked
  fer what I got. I've harbored thieves in my old age and trusted them that
  wa'n't fit to be trusted. I've allus paid my debts, Seabeck. I'm willin' to
  pay now fer bein' a fool."</p>

  <p>"W-where's Charlie?" Billy Louise leaned and whispered the question.</p>

  <p>"I d'no, and I don't care. He's pulled out&mdash;him an' that breed. I'll
  have t' pay yuh for seven growed cattle I never seen till yist'day, Seabeck.
  You can set yer own price on 'em. I ain't sure, but I've got an idee they was
  shot las' night an' dumped in the river. You c'n set yer price. I've got
  rheumatiz so bad I couldn't go 'n' put a stop to
  nothin'&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Marthy!" Billy Louise was shivering and crying now. "Marthy! Don't be
  so&mdash;so hard. It was all Charlie&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Marthy harshly, "it was all Charlie. He was a thief, an' I was
  sech a simple-minded old fool I never knowed what he was. I let him go ahead,
  an' I set in the house with a white apurn tied on me an' thought I was havin'
  an easy time. I set here and let him rob my neighbors that I ain't never
  harmed er cheated out of a cent, and soon's he thought he was found out,
  he&mdash;left ole Marthy to look after herself. Never so much as fed the hogs
  or done the milkin' first! Looky here, Seabeck! You'll git paid back, an'
  I'll take your figgers fer what I owe, but if you git after Charlie,
  I'll&mdash;kill yuh. You let 'im go, I'm the one he hurt most&mdash;and I
  ain't goin'&mdash;" She laid her frowsy old head on her arms, like one who is
  utterly crushed and dumb.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Marthy!" Billy Louise knelt and threw her arms around Marthy's
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You've got to come and lie down, Marthy," said Billy Louise, after a
  long, unbroken silence.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Seabeck, if you'll start a fire, I'll make some tea for her. Come,
  Marthy&mdash;just to please me. Do it for Billy Louise, Marthy."</p>

  <p>The old woman rose stiffly, and with a feebleness that seemed utterly
  foreign to her usual energy, permitted Billy Louise to lead her from the
  kitchen. In the sitting-room that Charlie had built and furnished for her,
  Marthy lay and stared around her with that same dull apathy she had shown
  from the first. Only once did she manifest any real emotion, and that was
  when Billy Louise came in with some tea and toast.</p>

  <p>"You take all them books outa them shelves an' burn 'em up," she
  commanded. "An' you take them two pictures off'n that shelf, of him an' her,
  an' bring 'em t' me."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise set the toast and tea down on a chair and brought the
  pictures. She did not say a word, but she looked a little scared and her eyes
  were very big, just as they had been when Ward mistook her for Buck Olney and
  so let her see into another one of the dark places of life. It seemed to
  Billy Louise that she was being compelled to look into a good many dark
  places, lately.</p>

  <p>Marthy took the two photographs and looked at the first with hatred. "The
  Jezebel! She won't git to run it over ole Marthy," she muttered with sullen
  triumph and twisted the cardboard spitefully in her gnarled old fingers. "She
  can't come here an' take all I've got an' never give me a thankye for it. I'm
  shet uh her, anyway." She twisted again and yet again, till the picture was a
  handful of ragged scraps of cardboard. Then she raised herself to an elbow
  and flung the fragments far from her and lay down again with glum
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Her fingers touched the other picture, which had slid to the couch.
  Mechanically she picked it up and held it so that the light from the window
  struck it full. This was Charlie's face&mdash;Charlie with the falsely frank
  smile in his eyes, and with his lips curved as they did when he was just
  going to say, "Now, Aunt Martha!" in tender protest against her too eager
  industry.</p>

  <p>Marthy's chin began to quiver while she looked. Her lips sagged with the
  pull of her aching heart. For the third time in her life Billy Louise saw
  big, slow tears gather in Marthy's hard blue eyes and slide down the leathery
  seams in her cheeks. Billy Louise looked, found her vision blurring with her
  own tears, and turned and tiptoed from the room.</p>

  <p>Seabeck was gone somewhere on his horse. Billy Louise guessed shrewdly
  that he was down in the meadows, looking over the cattle and trying to
  estimate the extent of the thievery. She put Blue in the stable and fed him,
  with that half-mechanical habit of attending to the needs of one's mount
  which becomes second nature to the range-bred. She would not go on to the
  Wolverine; that needed no decision; she accepted it at once as a fact. Marthy
  needed her now more than anyone. More even than Ward, though Billy Louise
  hated to think of him up there alone and practically helpless. But Marthy
  must have her to-night. Marthy was facing her bitterest sorrow since Minervy
  died, and Marthy was old. Ward, Billy Louise reminded herself sternly, was
  not old, and he was facing happiness&mdash;so far as he or anyone knew. She
  wanted very much to be with Ward, but she could not delude her conscience
  into believing that he needed her more than did Marthy.</p>

  <p>Seabeck returned after awhile, and Billy Louise, who was watching from the
  doorway, met him at the little gate as he was coming up to the house.</p>

  <p>"Well, how bad is it, Mr. Seabeck?" she asked sharply, just because she
  felt the imperative need of facts&mdash;she who had struggled so long in the
  quicksands of suspicion and doubts and fears and suspense.</p>

  <p>"Hmm-mm&mdash;how bad is it&mdash;in the house?" he countered. "The real
  crime has been committed there, it seems to me. A few head of cattle, more or
  less, don't count for much against the broken heart of an old woman."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" Billy Louise, her hands clenched upon the gate, stared up wide-eyed
  into his face. And this was the real Seabeck, whom she had known impersonally
  all her life! This was the real man of him, whom she had never known; a
  flawless diamond of a soul behind those bright blue eyes and that pointed,
  graying beard; poet, philosopher, gentleman to the bone. "Oh! You saw that,
  too! And they're your cattle that were stolen! You saw it&mdash;oh,
  you're&mdash;you're&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hmm-mm&mdash;a human being, I hope, Miss MacDonald, as well as a mere
  cattleman. How is the old lady?"</p>

  <p>"Crying," said Billy Louise, with brief directness. "Crying over the
  picture of that&mdash;swine. Think of his running off and leaving her here
  all alone&mdash;and not even doing the chores first!" (Here, you must know,
  was broken an unwritten law of the ranch.) "And Marthy's got rheumatism, too,
  so she can hardly walk&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll attend to the chores, Miss MacDonald." Seabeck's lips quirked under
  the fingers that pulled at his whiskers. "You say&mdash;over his
  picture?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, over his picture!" Billy Louise spoke with a suppressed fury. "With
  that honest look in his eyes&mdash;oh, I could kill him!"</p>

  <p>"Hmm-mm&mdash;it does seem a pity that one can't. But if she can
  cry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I see. You believe too that tears are a necessary kind of weakness for a
  woman, like smoking tobacco is for a man&mdash;or swearing. Well, I can just
  tell you, Mr. Seabeck, that some tears pull the very soul out of a person;
  they're the red-hot pinchers of the torture-chamber of life, Mr. Seabeck.
  Every single, slow tear that Marthy sheds right now is taking that much away
  from her life. Why, she&mdash;she idolized that&mdash;that devil. She hadn't
  much that was lovable in poor old Jase; he was just her husband; he wasn't
  even a real man. And she never had any children to love, except a little girl
  that died. And she's worked here and scrimped and saved till she got just
  fairly comfortable, and then Charlie Fox came and patted her on the back and
  called her a game little lady, and poor old Marthy just poured out all the
  love and all the trust she had in her, on him! And she's old, and she had
  starved all her life for a little love&mdash;a little affection and a few
  kind words. I don't suppose Jase kissed her once in twenty years; I couldn't
  imagine him getting up steam enough to kiss anybody! And Charlie petted her
  and did little things for her that nobody had ever done in her life. It meant
  a whole lot to Marthy to have a man take the water bucket away from her and
  give her a little hug and tell her she mustn't think of carrying water; oh,
  you're a man, and I don't suppose you can realize; I didn't myself, till
  lately&mdash;" Billy Louise blushed and then twisted her lips, wondering if
  love had taught her all this.</p>

  <p>"And so Marthy just leaned more and more on him and let him take care of
  her and pet her; and she never once dreamed he was doing anything crooked. I
  thought she did, I know, Mr. Seabeck. I thought she was in it, too; but I see
  now that Marthy has been living the woman in her, these last two years; she'd
  never had a chance before. And now to have him&mdash;to know he's just a
  common thief and to have him go off and leave her&mdash;Mr. Seabeck, I'd be
  willing to bet all I've got that Marthy would have forgiven his stealing
  cattle, if he had just stayed. She'd have done anything on earth for him; and
  the bigger the sacrifice she made for him, the more she would have loved him;
  women are like that. But to have him go off&mdash;and&mdash;leave
  her&mdash;and not bother his head about what happened to her, just so he got
  out of it&mdash;Mr. Seabeck, that's going to kill Marthy. It's going to kill
  her by inches."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;see," he assented, looking thoughtfully at the flushed face and
  big, shining eyes of Billy Louise. (I wonder if Seabeck was not thinking how
  he had known Billy Louise impersonally all her life and yet had never met the
  real Billy Louise until to-day!) "And yet," she added bitterly, "she's going
  to protect him if it takes every cent she's managed to rake together these
  last thirty years. You heard what she told you. She said she'd kill you if
  you hurt Charlie. She'd try it, too."</p>

  <p>"Hmm-mm, yes! My life has been threatened several times to-day." Seabeck
  looked at her with eyes a-twinkle, and Billy Louise blushed to the crown of
  her Stetson hat. "Do you think, Miss MacDonald, she would feel like talking
  business for a few minutes?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes; if she's like me, she'll want to get the agony over with." Billy
  Louise turned with a twitch of the shoulders. She felt chilled, somehow. She
  had not quite expected that Seabeck would want to talk about his stolen stock
  at all. She had rather taken it for granted that he would let that subject
  lie quiet for awhile. Oh, well, he was a cattleman, after all.</p>

  <p>Marthy did not attempt to rise when Seabeck followed Billy Louise into the
  sitting-room. She caught up her apron and wiped her eyes and her nose,
  however, and she also slid Charlie's picture under the cheap cushion. After
  that she faced Seabeck with harsh composure and waited for the
  settlement.</p>

  <p>"Hm-mm! I have been looking over the cattle," he began, sitting on the
  edge of a chair and turning his black hat absently round and round by the
  brim. "You&mdash;mm-mm&mdash;you tell me there were seven head of grown
  stock&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That they shot and throwed in the river, with the brands cut out,"
  interpolated Marthy stolidly. "I heard 'em say that's how they would git rid
  of 'em, an' I heard 'em shootin' down there."</p>

  <p>"Hmm-mm, yes! Do you know just what&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Five dry cows 'n' two steers&mdash;long two-year-oles, I jedged 'em to
  be." Marthy was certainly prompt enough and explicit enough. And her lips
  were grim, and her faded blue eyes hard and steady upon the face of
  Seabeck.</p>

  <p>"Hmm-mm&mdash;yes! I find also," he went on in his somewhat precise voice
  that had earned him the nickname of "Deacon" among his punchers, "that there
  are more young stock vented and rebranded than I&mdash;er&mdash;sold your
  nephew. Fourteen head, to be exact. With the cattle you tell me which
  were&mdash;mm-m&mdash;disposed of last night, that would make twenty-one head
  of stock for which&mdash;mm-mm&mdash;I take it you are willing to pay."</p>

  <p>"I ain't got the money now," Marthy stated, too apathetic to be either
  defiant or placating. "You c'n fix up the papers t' suit yerself. I'll sign
  anything yuh want."</p>

  <p>"Hmm-mm&mdash;yes! A note covering the amount, with legal rate of
  interest, will be&mdash;quite satisfactory, Mrs. Meilke. I shall make a lump
  sum at the going price for mixed stock. If you have a blank note,
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You kin look in that desk over there," permitted Marthy. "If yuh don't
  find any there, there ain't none nowhere."</p>

  <p>Seabeck did not find any blank notes. He found an eloquent confusion of
  jumbled letters and accounts and papers, and guessed that the owner had done
  some hasty sorting and straightening of his affairs. He sighed, and his blue
  eyes hardened for a minute. Then Billy Louise moved from the door and went
  over to kneel comfortingly beside Marthy, and Seabeck looked at the two and
  sighed again, though his eyes were no longer stern. He pulled a sheet of
  paper toward him and wrote steadily in a prim, upright chirography that had
  never a flourish anywhere, but carefully crossed t's and carefully dotted i's
  and punctuation marks of beautiful exactness.</p>

  <p>"You will please sign here, Mrs. Meilke," he said calmly, coming over to
  them with the sheet of paper laid smoothly upon a last-year's best-seller and
  with Charlie's fountain pen in his other hand. "And if Miss MacDonald will
  also sign, as an endorser, I think I can safely do away with any mortgage or
  other legal security."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise stood up and gave him one look&mdash;which Seabeck did not
  appreciate, because he did not see it.</p>

  <p>"I'd ruther give a mortgage," Marthy said uneasily, sitting up suddenly
  and looking from one to the other. "I don't want Billy Louise to git tangled
  up in my troubles. She's got plenty of her own. Her maw's just died, Mr.
  Seabeck. And I'll bet there was a hospital 'n' doctor's bill bigger 'n this
  cattle note, to be paid. I don't want to pile on&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now, Marthy, you be still. I'm perfectly willing to sign this note with
  you. If it will satisfy Mr. Seabeck, I'm sure it's the very least we can
  do&mdash;or&mdash;expect." Billy Louise, bless her heart, was trying very
  hard to be grateful to Seabeck in spite of the slump he had suffered in her
  estimation.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll want your written word that yuh won't prosycute Charlie nor
  help nobody else prosycute him," stipulated Marthy, with sudden shrewdness.
  "If me 'n Billy Louise signs this note, we'll pay it; and we want some
  pertection from you, fer Charlie."</p>

  <p>"Hmm-mm&mdash;I see!" He turned and went back to the littered desk and
  wrote carefully again upon another sheet of paper. "I think this will be
  quite satisfactory," he said, and handed the paper to Marthy.</p>

  <p>"Git my specs, Billy Louise&mdash;off 'n the shelf over there," she said,
  and read the paper laboriously, her lips forming the letters of every word
  which contained more than one syllable. Marthy, remember, was a plainswoman
  born and bred.</p>

  <p>"I guess that'll do," she pronounced at last, pushing the spectacles up on
  her lined forehead. "You read it, Billy Louise, 'n' see what yuh think."</p>

  <p>"I think it's all right, Marthy," said Billy Louise, after she had read
  the document twice. "It's a bill of sale; and it also wipes the slate clean
  of any possible&mdash;I think Mr. Seabeck is very c-clever."</p>

  <p>Whereupon Marthy signed the note, with a spluttering of the abused pen in
  her stiffened old fingers and a great twisting of her grim mouth as she
  formed the capitals. Then Billy Louise wrote her name with a fine, schoolgirl
  ease and a little curl on the end of the last d. Seabeck took the paper from
  the tips of Billy Louise's supercilious fingers, returned with it to the desk
  for a blotter, hunted an envelope, folded the note carefully, and laid it
  away inside.</p>

  <p>"I believe that is all, Mrs. Meilke. I hope you will suffer no further
  uneasiness on account of your&mdash;nephew."</p>

  <p>"I'm liable t' suffer some gittin' that five hundred dollars paid up,"
  Marthy returned with some acerbity. "I'm much obleeged to yuh, Mr. Seabeck,
  fer bein' so easy on us. If yuh hadn't drug Billy Louise into it, I'd say yer
  too good to be human."</p>

  <p>"Hmm-mm&mdash;not at all," Seabeck stammered deprecatingly and left the
  room with what haste his natural dignity would permit.</p>

  <p>That ended the Seabeck part of the whole sordid affair, except that he
  remained for another hour, doing chores and making everything snug for the
  night. Also he filled the kitchen woodbox as high as he could pile the sticks
  and brought water to last overnight&mdash;since Charlie's plan to pipe water
  into the cabin had remained a beautiful plan and nothing more. Billy Louise
  thanked Seabeck, when he was ready to go.</p>

  <p>"I knew you were square, and you're really big-souled, too. I'll remember
  it always, Mr. Seabeck."</p>

  <p>"Will you?" Seabeck looked down at her, with his hand upon the latch.
  "Even if you are put in a position where you must pay that note&mdash;you
  will still&mdash; Hm-mm! I see. Before I go, Miss MacDonald, I should like
  your permission to send a man down here to look after things."</p>

  <p>"No, you mustn't." Billy Louise spoke with prompt decision. "Marthy might
  think you were&mdash;you see, it wouldn't do. I'll see about getting a man.
  If you will take this note up and leave it in the mail-box for me, John
  Pringle will come up to-morrow. We'll manage all right."</p>

  <p>"You're quite right. But, Miss MacDonald, there is something else.
  I&mdash;er&mdash;should like to give you a little&mdash;wedding gift, since
  you honored me with the news of your approaching&mdash;mm-m&mdash;marriage.
  As an old neighbor, and one of your most sincere admirers, who would feel
  greatly honored by your friendship, I&mdash;should like to have you accept
  this&mdash;" He held something out to Billy Louise and pulled open the door
  for instant escape. "Good night, Miss MacDonald. I think it will storm." Then
  he was gone, hurrying down the narrow path with long strides, his tall figure
  bent to the wind, his coat napping around his lean legs.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise closed the door and her half-open mouth and let down her
  lifted eyelids. Standing with her back against the wall, she turned that
  something&mdash;an envelope&mdash;over twice, then tore off the end and
  pulled out the contents. It was the note she and Marthy had signed no longer
  than an hour ago, and written large across the face of it were the words:
  "Paid, Samuel Seabeck."</p>

  <p>"The&mdash;old&mdash;darling!" said Billy Louise under her breath and went
  straight in to show it to Marthy.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash; ALL RIGHT AND COMFY</h2>

  <p class="first">SEABECK was a fine weather prophet, for that time at least.
  It did storm that night and the next day and the next; a howling, tearing
  blizzard that carried the snow so far and so fast that it almost wore it out;
  so that when the spasm was over, the land lay bleaker and raggeder than ever,
  with hard-packed drifts in all the hollows and bare ground between. Of course
  it was out of the question for Billy Louise to leave the Cove while the storm
  lasted, so she took care of Marthy and the pigs and chickens and cows, and
  between whiles she tormented herself with direful pictures of Ward up there
  alone on Mill Creek. Sometimes she saw him raving in fever and wanting a
  drink which he could not get, so that thirst tortured him; then calling for
  her, when she could not come. Sometimes she saw him trying to hobble
  somewhere on those crutches, and falling exhausted&mdash;breaking more bones,
  perhaps; or catching more cold, or something. She was a most distressed Billy
  Louise, believe me, and she wished a hundred times a day that she had stayed
  with Ward; she wished that, in spite of Marthy's need of her. She was
  terribly sorry for Marthy; but Marthy had not broken any leg, and besides,
  she was not in love with Marthy.</p>

  <p>On the second day John Pringle battled through the storm to see what Billy
  Louise would have him do. And Billy Louise gave him instructions about
  finding a man and sending him up to the Cove at once, and looking after the
  Wolverine ranch until she came, and having Phoebe send up some clothes for
  her. She felt better when she had set the wheels in motion again, and as she
  stood in the door and watched John's broad, stolid back out of sight on his
  homeward journey, she made up her mind that she would start at daylight for
  Mill Creek, and she didn't care whether it stormed or not. She simply would
  not leave Ward there alone any longer. She almost wished that she had told
  Seabeck about Ward; he would have sent a man over to look after him. But she
  was selfish, and she wanted Ward to herself; so she had not so much as
  mentioned his name to Seabeck.</p>

  <p>She milked the two cows by lantern light, next morning; and the pigs did
  not seem to want to leave their nests when she poured their breakfast into
  the trough by the wavering light she carried. She made coffee for Marthy and
  took it to her in bed, and told her that she would leave plenty of wood and
  kindling, and that Marthy must sleep as long as she could and not worry about
  a single, living thing. She said she must get an early start, because it
  might be "bad going" and she meant to bring Ward back with her if he were
  able to travel at all.</p>

  <p>"I can't be in two places at once, Marthy, so if you don't mind, I'll
  bring him down here where I can look after the two of you at the same time.
  You'll let me, won't you? Or else," she added hopefully, "I'll take you both
  down home. Would you rather&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'd ruther stay here where I b'long," said Marthy dully. "But I don't
  want you should go t' any trouble about me, Billy Louise. I've rustled fer
  m'self all my life, and I guess I kin yit. If it wa'n't fer my rheumatiz, I'd
  ask no odds of anybody. I ain't goin' t' leave, anyway. Charlie might come
  back, er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, you needn't leave." Billy Louise told herself that she was not
  disappointed, because she had not hoped to persuade Marthy to leave the Cove.
  "You don't mind if I bring Ward down here, do you, Marthy?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't mind nothin' you kin do," said Marthy in the same dull tone,
  pouring her saucer full of coffee and spilling some on her pillow, because
  her hands were not as steady as they used to be. "He kin sleep in Charlie's
  room, if yuh want he should." She took two big swallows that emptied the
  saucer, handed the dish to Billy Louise, and lay down again. "I don't seem to
  care about nothin'," she remarked tonelessly. "I'd jest as soon die as live.
  I wisht you'd send word to Seabeck I want t' see him, Billy Louise. Oh, it
  ain't about Charlie," she added harshly. "He's shet uh me, and I'm shet uh
  him. I&mdash;got some other business with Seabeck. Tell him to bring a couple
  uh men along with him."</p>

  <p>"Is there any hurry, Marthy?" Billy Louise stood holding the cup and
  saucer in her two hands, and stared down anxiously at the lined old face on
  the pillow. A faint, red glow was in the sky, and the lamp-light dimmed with
  the coming of day. "You don't feel&mdash;badly, do you, Marthy?"</p>

  <p>"Me? No, Why should I feel bad? But I want t' see Seabeck and a couple of
  his men, jest as quick as you kin git word to 'em."</p>

  <p>"Which ones?" Billy Louise was plainly puzzled. Was Marthy going to make
  him take those cattle back? It was like her. Billy Louise did not blame her
  for feeling that way, either. If she had had the money, she would have paid
  him herself for the cattle.</p>

  <p>"It don't matter which ones. You send 'im word, Billy Louise, like the
  good girl yuh always have been. You've always kinda took the place of my
  Minervy to me, Billy Louise; and I won't bother yuh much longer."</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course I will! The stage will go up this forenoon. I'll send a
  note to Seabeck. It won't be any bother at all. What shall I say? Just that
  you want to see him?"</p>

  <p>"I kin write it m'self, I guess, if you'll bring me a pencil and paper. I
  can't seem t' git used to a pen. I kin write all I want t' say."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise let it go at that. She brought the paper and pencil and went
  after Blue, while Marthy, sitting up in bed, wrote her note. Billy Louise was
  eager to start; and I don't think anyone should blame her if she hurried
  Marthy a little, and if her parting words were few, and her manner slightly
  abstracted. She knew just how Marthy was feeling&mdash;or thought she did;
  and she was simply wild with anxiety over Ward.</p>

  <p>Blue discovered before she was out of the gorge that his lady was wild
  over something. Never had she come so near to being a merciless rider as on
  that nippy morning. There were drifts: Blue went through them in great
  lunges. There were steep hills: but there was no stopping at the top to
  breathe awhile and admire the view. Billy Louise rode with an eye upon the
  climbing sun, and with her mind busy adding up miles and minutes.</p>

  <p>She rode up the creek trail at a long lope, and she pulled up at the
  stable and slid off Blue, who was wet to his ears and moving every rib when
  he breathed. (Blue was a good horse, with plenty of speed and stamina, but
  Billy Louise had given him all he wanted, that morning.) She went straight to
  a corner of the hay corral and stopped with her hands clutching the top
  wire.</p>

  <p>"Ward Warren, for heaven's sake, what are you doing?" You couldn't have
  told from her tone that she had been crying, a mile back, from sheer anxiety,
  or that she "loved him to pieces." She sounded as if she did not love him at
  all and was merely disgusted with his actions.</p>

  <p>"I'm trying to sink my loop on this damned buzzard-head of a horse," Ward
  retorted glumly. "I've been trying for about an hour," he added, grinning a
  little at his own plight.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's a lucky thing for you he won't let you," Billy Louise informed
  him sternly, stooping to crawl under the bottom wire. "You've got about as
  much sense as&mdash;" She did not say what. "Give me that rope, and you take
  yourself and your crutches out of the corral, Mr. Smarty. I just had a hunch
  you couldn't be trusted to behave yourself."</p>

  <p>"Brave Buckaroo got lonesome," Ward said, looking at her with eyes alight,
  as he hobbled slowly toward her. "You'll have to open the gate for me,
  William. Rattler'll make a break for the open if he sees a crack as wide as
  your little finger."</p>

  <p>By then he was near enough to reach out an arm and pull her close to him.
  "Oh, William girl, I'm sure glad to see you once more. I got scared. I
  thought maybe I just dreamed you were here; so I tackled&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You tackled more than you could handle," Billy Louise finished with her
  lips close to his. "You haven't got any sense at all. You might have known
  I'd come the very first minute I could."</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;I know."</p>

  <p>"And you ought to know you mustn't try to ride Rattler, Ward. What if he'd
  pitch with you?"</p>

  <p>"In that case, I'd pile up, I reckon. Say, William, a broken leg does take
  a hell of a time to get well. But all the same, I'll top old Rattler, all
  right. I'd top anything rather than spend another night in that jail."</p>

  <p>"You'll ride Blue," Billy Louise told him calmly "I'm going to ride
  Rattler myself."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are&mdash;not!"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say I can't? Do you think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I guess you can, all right, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, if I can, I'm going to. If you think I can't handle a measly old
  skate like that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's been running out for nearly two months, Wilhemina&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And look at his ribs! If you'll just kindly go in the house while I
  saddle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll kindly stay right here, lady-girl. You don't know
  Rattler&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you don't know Billy Louise MacDonald." She wrinkled her nose at him
  and turned back to unsaddle Blue. "I really didn't intend to go back right
  now," she said, "but seeing you've got your heart set on it, I suppose we
  might as well." Then she added: "We're only going as far as the Cove, anyway;
  and I really ought to hurry back to look after Marthy. Charlie Fox and Peter
  pulled out and left her there all solitary alone. I've been staying with her
  since I left here. I told her we'd be down there, and stay till&mdash;further
  notice."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise did not give Ward much opportunity for argument. He was too
  awkward with his crutches to keep up with her, and she managed to be on the
  move most of the time.</p>

  <p>I may as well admit that she was horribly afraid of Rattler, and horribly
  afraid that he and Ward would find it out. She did not hurry much. She took
  plenty of time to put Ward's saddle on Blue, and when she finally took her
  rope and went in after Rattler, who was regarding her from the corner of the
  stack where he might run either way, she wished that Ward was
  elsewhere&mdash;and she did not much care where.</p>

  <p>But Ward was anxious, and he stayed where he was by the corner of the
  stable and swore in violent undertones because he was condemned to look on
  while his Wilhemina took long chances on getting hurt. Not a move of hers
  escaped his fear-sharpened eyes, while she went carelessly close to Rattler,
  and then, with a quick flip, landed the loop neatly over his head. Ward would
  have felt less pleased if he had known how her heart was thumping. He saw
  only the whimsical twist of her lips and thought that she was enjoying a
  distinctly feminine sense of triumph at her success.</p>

  <p>Billy Louise led Rattler boldly up to where lay her saddle and Ward's
  bridle. She hoped she did not look scared, but she was wondering all the time
  what Rattler would do when she "piled on"; pile her off, probably, her
  pessimism told her, for Billy Louise was no lady broncho-fighter, for all she
  rode so well on horses that she knew. There is a difference.</p>

  <p>"Sure you want to tackle him, lady-girl?" Ward asked her, after he had
  himself attended to the bridling&mdash;since Rattler was touchy about the
  head. "Of course, he isn't bad, when you know him; but he's liable to be
  pretty snuffy after running out so long. And he never had a woman on him. You
  better let me ride him."</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly. You couldn't even mount him, with that game leg. And
  besides, don't you see I've been wanting an excuse to ride Rattler ever since
  I knew you? You must have a very poor opinion of my riding."</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you put it that way&mdash;" Ward yielded, just as she knew he
  would. "I haven't a doubt but what you can handle him if you take a notion.
  Only&mdash;if you got hurt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I won't." Billy Louise braced her courage with a smile and picked up
  the saddle blanket. But Ward took it from her and hobbled close enough to
  adjust it.</p>

  <p>"He knows me," he explained meaningly. "Better let me saddle up. He don't
  know but what I can cave a rib or two in, if he don't behave. Just hand me
  the saddle, William, please."</p>

  <p>"You're only trying to scare me out," Billy Louise accused him, with a
  vast relief well hidden. "I'm not a bit afraid of him."</p>

  <p>"All right; that'll help some." He steadied himself by the horse's
  twitching shoulder while he reached carefully for the cinch. "I guess I'm
  more scared than you are."</p>

  <p>"I know you are. I've taken too many tumbles to let the prospect of
  another one worry me, anyway. Why, Blue ditched me himself, three different
  times when I first began to ride him. And even yet the old devil would like
  to, once in a while." Billy Louise was actually talking herself rapidly into
  a feeling of confidence.</p>

  <p>She needed it. When she had helped Ward upon Blue&mdash;and that was not
  easy, either, considering that he only had one leg fit to stand on&mdash;and
  had gone to the cabin for her bag of nuggets and Ward's roll of money which
  he had forgotten, and had exhausted every other excuse for delay, she picked
  up Rattler's reins and wound her fingers in his mane, and took hold of the
  stirrup as nonchalantly as if she were mounting Blue.</p>

  <p>She went up at the instant when Rattler jumped sidewise from her. She got
  partly into the saddle, clung there for a few harrowing seconds, and then
  went over his head and plump into a snowdrift beside the stable.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" groaned Ward and went white and weak as he watched.</p>

  <p>"Good gracious!" grumbled Billy Louise, righting herself and digging snow
  out of her collar and sleeves. "Stop your laughing, Ward Warren!" (Ward was
  not laughing, and she knew it.) "I'll ride that ornery cayuse, just to show
  him I can. You Rattler, I'll fix you for that!" She turned to Ward and
  twisted her lips at him. "I see now why you named him that," she said.
  "Because he rattles your teeth loose."</p>

  <p>"You keep off him!" Ward shouted sternly.</p>

  <p>"You keep still!" Billy Louise shouted back at him. "We're going to find
  out right now who's boss."</p>

  <p>Whether she referred to Rattler or to his master she did not stipulate;
  perhaps she meant both of them. At any rate, she caught the horse again and
  mounted, a great deal more cautiously than she had at first, in spite of
  Ward's threats and entreaties. She got fairly into the saddle and stayed
  there&mdash;with the help of the horn and the luck that had thus far carried
  her through almost anything she undertook. She was not a bit ashamed of
  "pulling leather."</p>

  <p>"Now we're all right and comfy," she announced breathlessly, when the
  first fight was over and Rattler, like his master, had yielded to the
  inevitable. "And we know who's boss, and we're all of us squindiciously
  happy, because we're headed for home. Aren't we, buckaroo?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," Ward mumbled doubtingly, for a moment eyeing her sidelong.
  He was not quite over his scare yet.</p>

  <p>"And say, buckaroo!" Billy Louise reined close, so that she could reach
  out and pinch his arm a little bit. "Soon as your leg is all well, and you're
  every speck over the hookin'-cough, why&mdash;you can be the boss!"</p>

  <p>"Can I?"</p>

  <p>"Honest, you can. I've"&mdash;Billy Louise had the grace to blush a
  little&mdash;"I've always thought I'd love to have somebody bully me and boss
  me and 'buse me. And I&mdash;" Her lips twitched a little. "I think you can
  qualify. What was that you said just as I was getting on the second time? I
  was too busy to listen, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what? I don't remember that I said anything." Ward got hold of her
  free hand and held it tight.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, you did! It was sweary, too."</p>

  <p>"Was it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was. You sweared at Flower of the Ranch-oh."</p>

  <p>Billy Louise stopped at that, since Ward refused to be baited. She sensed
  that there were bigger things than a "sweary" sentence in the forefront of
  her buckaroo's mind. She waited.</p>

  <p>They came to the gate, and Billy Louise freed her hand from his clasp and
  dismounted, since it was a wire gate and could not be opened on horseback.
  She closed it after him, looked to her cinch, tightened it a little, patted
  Rattler forgivingly on the neck, caught the horn with one hand and the
  stirrup with the other, and went up quite like a man, while Ward watched her
  intently.</p>

  <p>"'In sooth, I know not why you are so sa-ad,'" murmured Billy Louise, when
  she swung alongside in the trail.</p>

  <p>Ward caught her hand again and did not let go; so they rode hand in hand
  down the narrow valley.</p>

  <p>"I was wondering&mdash;" he hesitated, drawing in a corner of his lip,
  biting it, and letting it go. "Wilhemina, if old Lady Fortune takes a notion
  to give me another kick or two, just when life looks so good to
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why, we'll kick back just as hard as she does," threatened Billy Louise
  courageously. "Don't let happiness get on your nerves, Ward."</p>

  <p>"If I wasn't crippled, it wouldn't. But when a man's down and out,
  he&mdash;thinks a lot. The last three days, I've lived a whole lifetime,
  lady-girl. Everything seems to be coming my way, all at once. And I'm afraid;
  what if I can't make good? If I can't make you happy"&mdash;he squeezed her
  fingers so that Billy Louise had to grit her teeth to keep from interrupting
  him&mdash;"or if anything should happen to you&mdash;Lord! I&mdash;I never
  knew what it was to be crazy scared till I saw you fall off Rattler.
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You've got nerves, buckaroo. You've been shut up there alone so long you
  see things all distorted. We're going to be happy, because we'll be together,
  and we've so much to do and so much to think of. You must realize, Ward, that
  we've got three places to take care of, and you and me and poor old Marthy.
  She hasn't anybody, Ward, but us. And she's changed so&mdash;got so
  old&mdash;just in the last few days. I never knew a person could change so
  much in such a little while. She's just let go all holds and kind of sagged
  down, mentally and physically. We'll have to take care of her, Ward, as long
  as she lives. That's why I'm taking you there&mdash;so we can look after her.
  She won't leave the Cove. I&mdash;I was hoping," she added shyly, "that we
  could sit in front of our own fireplace, Ward, and have nice cozy evenings;
  but&mdash;-well, there always seems to be something for me to do for
  somebody, Ward."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you Wilhemina!" Ward slipped his arm around her, to the disgust of
  Rattler and Blue, and made shift to kiss her twice. "Long as you live, you'll
  always be doing something for somebody; that's the way you're made. And
  nobody's been doing things for you; but if the Lord lets me live, that's
  going to be my job from now on."</p>

  <p>He said a great deal more, of course. They had nearly fifteen miles to go,
  and they rode at a walk; and a man and a maid can say a good deal at such a
  time. But I don't think they would like to have it all repeated. Their
  thoughts ranged far: back over the past and far into the future, and clung
  close to the miracle of love that had brought them together. There is one
  thing which Billy Louise, even in her most self-revealing mood, did not tell
  Ward, and that is her doubts of him. Never once did he dream that she had
  suspected him and wrung her heart because of her suspicions&mdash;and in that
  I think she was wise and kind.</p>

  <p>They found Seabeck and Floyd Carson and another cowboy at the Cove, just
  preparing to leave. Marthy, it transpired, had wanted to make her will, so
  that Billy Louise would have the Cove when Marthy was done with it. Billy
  Louise cried a little and argued a good deal, but Marthy had not lost all her
  stubbornness, and the will stood unchanged.</p>

  <p>When Ward understood all of the circumstances, he hobbled into the kitchen
  and signaled Seabeck to follow him; and there he counted out five hundred
  dollars from his last gold-harvest and with a few crisp sentences compelled
  Seabeck to accept the money. (At that, Seabeck stood a loser by Charlie's
  thievery, but no one knew it save himself, since he never mentioned the
  matter.) Billy Louise and Ward were married just as soon as Ward was able to
  make the trip to the county-seat, which was just as soon as he could walk
  comfortably with a cane.</p>

  <p>They stayed the winter in the Cove, and a part of the spring. Then they
  buried grim, gray old Marthy up on the side hill near Jase, where she had
  asked them to lay her work-worn body when she was gone.</p>

  <p>They were very busy and very happy and pretty prosperous with their three
  ranches and what gold Ward washed out of the gravel-bank while they were
  living up on Mill Creek, so that he could prove up on his claim. They never
  heard of Charlie Fox again, or of Buck Olney&mdash;and they never wanted
  to.</p>

  <p>If you should some time ride through a certain portion of Idaho, you may
  find the tiny valley of the Wolverine and the decaying cabins which prove how
  impossible it is for a couple to live in three places at once. If you should
  be so fortunate as to meet Billy Louise, she might take you through the
  canyon and point out to you her cave and Minervy's. It is possible that she
  might also show you the washout which always made her and Ward laugh when
  they passed it. And if you ride up over the hill and along the upland and
  down another hill, you cannot fail to find the entrance to the Cove; and
  perhaps you will like to ride down the gorge and see the little Eden hidden
  away there. You may even ride as far as Mill Creek; but you will be told,
  very likely, that no one ever found any gold there. And if you should meet
  them, give my regards to Billy Louise and Ward&mdash;who never calls himself
  a football these days.</p>
