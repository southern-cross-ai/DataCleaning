  <h2><a id="chap01"
     name="chap01">I. STRANGE COMPANY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Snow had already fallen above timber line, and the
horseman, struggling
  over the summit, looked eagerly down into the broad valleys below, dark with
  evergreens. There was half an hour more of sunshine, but by the time he had
  ridden through the belt of lodge-pole pines, those stubborn marchers up to
  the mountaintops, a stiffening north wind had sheeted the sky from horizon to
  horizon with clouds.</p>

  <p>Even before the rain began he put on his slicker to turn the edge of the
  gale, but, as he came out of the pines and into the more open and gently
  rolling lands beyond, the rain was beginning to drive down the valley. The
  lower he dropped toward the bottom lands the lower dropped the storm clouds
  above him, until the summits were quite lost in rolling gray masses and a
  mist of thin rain slanted across the trail.</p>

  <p>The mare turned her head sideways to it, taking the brunt on one flattened
  ear and from time to time shaking off the drops of moisture. Between her and
  the rider there existed an almost conversational intimacy, it seemed. He had
  spread out the skirt of his slicker so as to cover as great a portion of her
  barrel as possible; as the chill of the rain increased, he encouraged her
  with talk. She replied with a slight pricking of her ears from time to time
  and often threw up her head in that way horses have when they wish to see the
  master the more clearly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, she descended the precipitous trail with such cat-footed
  activity that it was plain she had spent her life among the mountains. The
  rider made little effort to direct her but allowed her to follow her own
  fancy, as though confident that she would take the quickest way to the bottom
  of the slope. This, indeed, she did, sometimes slackening her pace for a
  moment to study the lay of the land ahead, sometimes taking a steep down
  pitch on braced legs, sometimes wandering in easy loops to one side or the
  other.</p>

  <p>In such a manner she came in the dusk of that late, stormy afternoon to
  the almost level going of the valley floor. Now it was possible to see her at
  her best, for she sprang out in a smooth and stretching gallop with such
  easily working muscles that her gait was deceptively fast. Here, again, the
  rider simply pointed out the goal and then let her take her own way toward
  it.</p>

  <p>That goal was the only building in sight. Perhaps for miles and miles it
  was the only structure, and the face of the rider brightened as he made out
  the sharp angle of the roof. The ears of the mare pricked. Their way across
  the mountains had been a long one; they had been several hours in the snows
  above timber line; and this promise of shelter was a golden one.</p>

  <p>But it was a deceptive promise, for when they came in the face of the
  driving storm they found that the tall building was not a ranch house but
  merely a ruined barn. It had once been a portion of a large establishment of
  some cattle owner, but the house proper and its outlying structures had
  melted away with the passage of time and the beating of such storms as that
  of this day. The sheds were mere crumbling ridges; the house was a ragged
  mound from which rotting timber ends projected. Only the barn subsisted.</p>

  <p>It was of vast size. Hundreds of tons of loose hay could have been stored
  in its mow; scores of horses could have been stalled along its sides. And it
  had been built with such unusual solidity that, whereas the rest of the
  buildings had disintegrated, this one kept its original dimensions intact
  through half of its length. The south front was whole. Only the northern
  portion of the building had crushed in. But for some reason this combination
  of ruin and repair was more melancholy than the utter destruction of the rest
  of the ranch.</p>

  <p>The horseman regarded this sight with a shake of the head and then looked
  again up the valley. But it would be difficult to continue. By this time it
  must have been sunset, and the storm dimmed the earth to the colors of late
  twilight. Every moment the wind freshened out of the north, picking up the
  drifts of rain and whirling them into gray ghost forms. To continue down a
  blind trail in the face of this gale, with no definite destination, was
  madness. The horseman resigned himself with a sigh to staying in the ruined
  barn until dawn.</p>

  <p>He rode the mare, therefore, through a fallen section of the south front
  of the structure and into what had once been the mow. Stale scents of moldy
  straw still lingered in it.</p>

  <p>Once inside, there was barely sufficient light to show the wanderer the
  dim outlines of the barn, and it was even more imposing in dimensions from
  within than from without. To the roof was a dizzy rise. A broad space
  extended on either side to the supporting walls. Half a regiment might
  bivouac here. Most important of all, the north gable was almost entirely
  blocked. That end of the building, though fallen, had not yet crumbled to the
  ground, and the broken roof formed a sort of enormous apron extending against
  the wind.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had discovered this, the wanderer began at once to make
  systematic preparations for spending the night. He first rode the mare back
  into the open air to a rain rivulet, where she was allowed to drink. Then he
  returned, dismounted, gathered some fragments of wood, and lighted a
  fire.</p>

  <p>The first leap of the yellow light transfigured the gloomy place. It
  started a shudder and dance of great shadows among the network of rafters
  above and in the corners of the building; it also showed the mare, from which
  the traveler now removed the saddle and rubbed her down&mdash;a bit of work
  of which most of the other riders of the Rocky Mountains would not have
  thought. He dried her as well as he could, and, before paying the slightest
  attention to his own wants, he produced from his saddle bags a mixture of
  chopped hay and crushed barley, a provision for his horse which he carried
  with him wherever he went. His glance wandered affectionately over her, for
  truly she was a beautiful creature.</p>

  <p>In color she was a rich bay. Her stature was rather less than the average,
  for she was not more than fifteen hands and three inches in height; but what
  she lacked in height she made up in the exquisite nicety of her proportions.
  At first glance she looked rather too fine for hard mountain work, but a
  little closer examination showed ample girth at the cinches, nobly sloped
  shoulders, and quarters to match. In fact, she could have carried a
  heavyweight, and the bulk of her owner was a trifle for her strength.</p>

  <p>He proved a slenderly made fellow as he turned away from the mare and
  threw more wood on the fire&mdash;a man of medium height and in no way
  imposing physically. His carriage alone struck the eye. He was erect as a
  whipstock, bore his head high and proudly, and moved with a light, quick
  step, as though he had been forced to act quickly so often that the habit had
  formed and hardened on him. That alert and jaunty carriage would in itself
  have won him some respect, even if his name had not been Ronicky Doone, whose
  fame in the more southerly ranges was already a notable thing. Horse-breaker,
  mischief- maker, adventurer by instinct, and fighter for sheer love of
  battle, he carried on his young body enough scars to have decked out half a
  dozen hardy warriors of the mountains, but the scars were all he had gained.
  The quarrels he fought had been the quarrels of others; and, since he was a
  champion of lost causes, the rewards of his actions went to others.</p>

  <p>Now he rolled down his blanket beside the fire, which he had built for the
  sake of warmth and good cheer rather than for cooking. His fare consisted of
  hard crackers and was finished off with a draft of cold water from his
  canteen; then he was ready for sleep.</p>

  <p>He found shelter at the north end of the mow. Here a great section of the
  disintegrating roof had fallen and stood end up, walling away a little room
  half a dozen paces in length and something more than half of that in width.
  By the vague light cast from the fire, which was rapidly blackening under the
  downpour of the rain, he took up his new abode for the night, and Lou
  followed him into it, unbidden.</p>

  <p>He was wakened, after how long an interval he could not guess, by the
  sound of Lou getting to her feet, and a moment later he heard voices sounding
  in the big mow of the barn. Other travelers had taken refuge from the storm,
  it seemed. Ronicky Doone, glad of a chance to exchange words with men, rose
  hastily and walked to the entrance his quarters.</p>

  <p>As he did so, a match was lighted, revealing two men standing beside their
  horses in the center of the great inclosure.</p>

  <p>"A fine place for a meeting," said he who held the match. "How come we got
  to ride out here to the end of the world?"</p>

  <p>His companion answered: "Maybe you'd have us meet up in a hotel or
  something, where the sheriff could scoop the whole bunch of us in. Is that
  your idea, Marty?"</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone had already advanced a step toward the newcomers, but as he
  heard these speeches he slipped back again, and, putting his hand over the
  nose of Lou, he hissed a caution into her ear. And glad he was that he had
  taught her this signal for silence. She remained at his back, not daring to
  stir or make a sound, and Ronicky, with a beating heart, crouched behind his
  barrier to spy on these strangers.</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap02"
     name="chap02">II. THE PLOT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"All I say, 'Baldy' McNair," said Marty, "Is that the old
man is sure
  stepping out long and hard to make things seem as mysterious as he can. Which
  they ain't no real need to come clean out here. This makes fifty miles I've
  rode, and you've come nigher onto eighty. What sense is in that, Baldy?"</p>

  <p>The match burned out. Baldy spoke in the dark.</p>

  <p>"Maybe the work he's got planned out lies ahead&mdash;lies north."</p>

  <p>"Maybe. But it sure grinds in on me the way he works. Never no reasons.
  Just orders. 'Meet here today after sunset.' That's all he says. I up and
  asks him: "Why after sunset, Jack? Afraid they'll be somebody to see us out
  there &mdash;a coyote or something, maybe?' But he wouldn't answer me
  nothing. 'You do what I say, ' says he, 'and figure out your reasons for
  yourself.' That's the way he talks. I say: Is it fit and proper to talk to a
  gent like he was a slave?"</p>

  <p>"Let's start a fire," said his companion. "Talk a pile better when we get
  some light on the subject."</p>

  <p>In a minute or two they had collected a great pile of dry stuff; a little
  later the flames were leaping up in great bodies toward the roof and puffing
  out into the darkness.</p>

  <p>The firelight showed Ronicky two men who had thrown their dripping
  slickers back from their shoulders. Marty was a scowling fellow with a black
  leather patch over his right eye. His companion justified his nickname by
  taking off his hat and revealing a head entirely and astonishingly free from
  hair. From the nape of his neck to his eyebrows there was not a vestige or a
  haze of hair. It gave him a look strangely infantile, which was increased by
  cheeks as rosy as autumn apples.</p>

  <p>"Now," went on Baldy McNair, "let me put something in your ear, Lang. A
  lot of the boys have heard you knock the chief. Which maybe the chief himself
  has heard."</p>

  <p>"He's give no sign," muttered Marty.</p>

  <p>"Son," said Baldy, who was obviously much younger than the man of the
  patched eye, but who apparently gained dignity by the baldness of his head,
  "when Jack Moon gives a sign, it's the first sign and the last sign all
  rolled into one. First you'll hear of it will be Moon asking you to step out
  and talk to him. And Moon'll come back from that talk alone and say that you
  started out sudden on a long trip. You wouldn't be the first. There was my
  old pal 'Lefty' and 'Gunner' Matthews. There was more, besides. Always that
  way! If they start getting sore at the way he runs things, he just takes them
  out walking, and they all go on that long journey that you'll be taking one
  of these days if you don't mind your talk, son! I'm telling you because I'm
  your friend, and you can lay to that!"</p>

  <p>"What I don't see," answered Marty Lang, "is why the chief wants to hang
  on to a gent forever. You make it out? Once in the band, always in the band.
  That ain't no sense. A gent don't want to stick to this game forever."</p>

  <p>"Oh, ho!" chuckled Baldy. "Is that the way of it? Well, son, don't ever
  let the chief hear you say that! Sure we get tired of having to ride wherever
  he tells us to ride, and we want to settle down now and then&mdash;or we
  think that we want to&mdash;and lead a quiet life and have a wife and a house
  and a family and all that. For that matter, there's nothing to keep us from
  it. The chief don't object."</p>

  <p>"Don't object? How can a gent settle down at anything when he's apt to get
  a call from the chief any minute?"</p>

  <p>"Wrong again. Not more'n once every six months. That's about the average.
  And then it's always something worth while. How long you been with us?"</p>

  <p>"Four years."</p>

  <p>"Ever gone hungry for four years?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"When you was sick, two years back, were you took care of?"</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"What did you have when the chief picked you up?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"All right. You were down to zero. He picked you up. He gave you a chance
  to live on the fat. All you got to do in return is to ride with him once in
  six months and to promise never to leave the band. Why? Because he knows that
  if ever a gent shakes clear of it he'll be tempted to start talking some day,
  and a mighty little talk would settle the hash of all of us. That's the why
  of it! He's a genius, Moon is. How long d'you think most long riders
  last?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno. They get bumped off before long."</p>

  <p>"Sure they do. Know why? Because the leaders have always kept their men
  together in a bunch most of the time. Moon seen that. What does he do? He
  gets a picked lot together. He gets a big money scheme all planned. Then he
  calls in his men. Some of 'em come fifty miles. Some of 'em live a hundred
  miles away. They all come. They make a dash and do the work. Soon's it's done
  they scatter again. And the posse that takes the tracks has five or six
  different trails to follow instead of one. Result? They get all tangled up.
  Jack Moon has been working twenty years and never been caught once! And he'll
  work twenty years more, son, and never be caught. Because why? Because he's a
  genius! Steady up! Who's that?"</p>

  <p>Straight through the entrance to the mow came two riders.</p>

  <p>"Silas Treat and the chief himself," said Lang.</p>

  <p>What Ronicky Doone saw were two formidable fellows. One, mounted on a
  great roan horse, was a broad-shouldered man with a square-cut black beard
  which rolled halfway down his chest. The other was well-nigh as large, and
  when he came into the inner circle of the firelight Ronicky saw one of those
  handsome, passionless faces which never reveal the passage of years. Jack
  Moon, according to Baldy, had been a leader in crime for twenty years, and
  according to that estimate he must be at least forty years old; but a casual
  glance would have placed him closer to thirty-three or four. He and his
  companion now reined their horses beside the fire and raised their hands in
  silent greeting. The black-bearded man did not speak. The leader, however,
  said:</p>

  <p>"Who started that fire?"</p>

  <p>"My idea," confessed Baldy. "Matter of fact, we both had the same idea.
  Didn't seem anything wrong about starting a fire and getting warm and
  dry."</p>

  <p>"I seen that fire a mile away," said the leader gloomily. "It was a fool
  idea."</p>

  <p>"But they's nobody else within miles."</p>

  <p>"Ain't there? Have you searched all through the barn?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;no."</p>

  <p>"How d'you know somebody didn't come here?"</p>

  <p>"But who'd be apt to come this way?"</p>

  <p>"Look at those cinders over there. That shows that somebody lately has
  been here and started a fire. If they come here once, why not again?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't notice that place," said Baldy regretfully. "Sure looks like
  I've been careless. But I'll give the barn a search now."</p>

  <p>"Only one place to look," said Jack Moon, "and that's behind that chunk of
  the roof where it's fallen down yonder."</p>

  <p>"All right!" The other nodded and started straight for the hiding place of
  Ronicky Doone.</p>

  <p>The latter reached behind him and patted the nose of the mare, Lou, in
  sign that she must still preserve the utmost silence. Then he drew his
  revolver. There was no question about what would happen if he were
  discovered. He had been in a position to overhear too many incriminating
  things. Unlucky Baldy, to be sure, would be an easy prey. But the other
  three? Three to one were large odds in any case, and every one of these men
  was formidable.</p>

  <p>Straight to the opening came Baldy and he peered in, though he remained at
  a distance of five or six paces. Ronicky Doone poised his gun, delayed the
  shot, and then frowned in wonder. Baldy had turned and was sauntering slowly
  back toward his companions.</p>

  <p>"Nothing there," he said to the chief, as he approached.</p>

  <p>Ronicky hardly believed his ears, but a moment of thought explained the
  mystery. It was pitch dark behind that screening wall, and the darkness was
  rendered doubly thick by Baldy's probable conviction that there must be
  nothing to see behind the fallen roof section. He had come there prepared to
  find nothing, and he had found the sum of his expectations and no more.</p>

  <p>"Sure there ain't?" and Jack Moon nodded. "Which don't mean that you
  wasn't a fool to light a fire and give somebody a light to shoot you by in
  case they was somebody lying around. Now, into the saddle both of you. We got
  a hard ride ahead."</p>

  <p>"Something big on hand?" asked Marty Lang.</p>

  <p>"There's a lesson for yaller-livered sneaks on hand," said Jack Moon, his
  deep bass voice floating smoothly back to the ear of Ronicky. "Hugh Dawn has
  come back to Trainor. We're going to drop in and call on him and ask him what
  he's been doing all these ten years."</p>

  <p>The low, growling murmur of the other three rolled away in the rush of
  rain beyond the door of the barn. The four horsemen disappeared, and Ronicky
  stepped out into the light of the dying fire. He had hardly taken a step
  forward when he shrank back against the wall.</p>

  <p>Straight into the door came Jack Moon, who peered uneasily about the barn.
  Then he whirled his horse away and disappeared into the thick downpour. He
  had seen nothing, and yet the true and suspicious instinct of the man had
  brought him back to take a final glance into the barn to make sure that no
  one had spied on the gathering of his little band.</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap03"
     name="chap03">III. THE DAWN HOUSE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Small things are often more suggestive, more illuminating,
than large
  events. All that Ronicky had heard Baldy say about Jack Moon and his twenty
  years' career of crime had not been so impressive as that sudden reappearance
  of the leader with all the implications of his hair-trigger sensitiveness.
  Ronicky Doone was by no means a foolish dreamer apt to be frightened away
  from danger by the mere face of it, but now he paused.</p>

  <p>Plainly, Hugh Dawn was a former member of the band, and this trip of
  Moon's was undertaken for the purpose, perhaps the sole purpose, of killing
  the offender who had left his ranks. Ronicky Doone considered. If Hugh Dawn
  had belonged to this crew ten years before, he had probably committed crimes
  as terrible as any in the band. If so, sympathy was wasted on him, for never
  in his life had Ronicky seen such an aggregation of dangerous men. It
  scarcely needed the conversation of Lang and Baldy to reveal the nature of
  the organization. Should he waste time and labor in attempting to warn Hugh
  Dawn of the coming trouble?</p>

  <p>Trainor, he knew, was a little crossroads village some twenty miles to the
  north. He might outdistance the criminal band and reach the town before them,
  but was it wise to intervene between such a man as Jack Moon and his destined
  victim? Distinctly it was not wise. It might call down the danger on his own
  head without saving Dawn. Moreover, it was a case of thief against thief,
  murderer against murderer, no doubt. If Dawn were put out of the way,
  probably no more would be done than was just.</p>

  <p>And still, knowing that the four bloodhounds were on the trail of one
  unwarned man, the spirit of Ronicky leaped with eagerness to be up and doing.
  Judgment was one thing, impulse was another, and all his life Ronicky Doone
  had been the creature of impulse. One man was in danger of four. All his love
  of fair play spurred him on to action.</p>

  <p>In a moment more the saddle was on the back of the mare, he had swung up
  into his place, flung the slicker over his shoulders, and cantered through
  the door of the barn.</p>

  <p>He turned well east of the trail which wound along the center of the
  valley. This, beyond question, the band would follow, but inside of half an
  hour Ronicky estimated that his mount, refreshed by her food and rest, would
  outfoot them sufficiently to make it safe to drop back into the better road
  without being in danger of meeting the four.</p>

  <p>Such, accordingly, was the plan he adopted. He struck out a long
  semicircle of half a dozen miles, which carried him down into the central
  trail again; then he headed straight north toward Trainor. The rain had
  fallen off to a mere misting by this time, and the wind was milder and came
  out of the dead west, so that there was nothing to impede their progress. The
  mountains began to lift gloomily into view, the walls of the valley drew
  steadily nearer on either side, and at length, at the head of the valley, he
  rode into the town of Trainor.</p>

  <p>With the houses dripping and the street a river of mud under the hoofs of
  Lou, the town looked like a perfect stage for a murder. Ronicky Doone
  dismounted in front of the hotel.</p>

  <p>There was no one in the narrow hallway which served as clerk's office and
  lobby. He beat with the butt of his gun against the wall and shouted, for
  there was no time to delay. At the most he could not have outdistanced Jack
  Moon by more than half an hour, and that was a meager margin in which to
  reach the victim, warn him, and see him started in his flight.</p>

  <p>Presently an old fellow with a goat beard stumbled down the stairs,
  rubbing his eyes.</p>

  <p>"And what might you want this late, partner?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Hugh Dawn," said Ronicky. "Where does Hugh Dawn live?"</p>

  <p>"Hugh Dawn?" said the other, his eyes blank with the effort of thought.
  Then he shook his head. "Dunno as I ever heard about any Hugh Dawn. Might be
  you got to the wrong town, son."</p>

  <p>It was partly disappointment, partly relief that made Ronicky Doone sigh.
  After all, tie had done his best; and, since his best was not good enough,
  Hugh Dawn must even die. However, he would still try.</p>

  <p>"You're sure there's no Dawn family living in these parts?"</p>

  <p>"Dawn family? Sure there is. But there ain't no Hugh Dawn ever I heard
  of."</p>

  <p>"How long you been around here?"</p>

  <p>"Eight years come next May Day."</p>

  <p>'Very well," said Ronicky brusquely, recalling that it was ten years
  before that Hugh Dawn, according to Jack Moon, had disappeared. "Where is the
  Dawn house?"</p>

  <p>"Old Grandpa Dawn," said the proprietor, "used to live out there, but he
  died a couple of years back. Now they ain't nobody but Jerry Dawn."</p>

  <p>"The son?"</p>

  <p>"It ain't a son. She's a girl. Geraldine is her name. Most always she's
  called Jerry, though. She teaches the school and makes out pretty good and
  lives in that big house all by herself."</p>

  <p>"And Where's the house, man?" cried Ronicky, wild with impatience.</p>

  <p>"Out the east road about a couple of miles. Can't help knowing it, it's so
  big. Stands in the middle of a bunch of pines and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The rest of his words trailed away into silence. Ronicky Doone had whipped
  out of the door and down the steps. Once in the saddle of Lou again, he sent
  her headlong down the east road. Would he be too late, after this delay at
  the hotel and the talk with the dim-minded old hotel proprietor?</p>

  <p>The house, as he had been told, was unmistakable. Dense foresting of pines
  swept up to it on a knoll well back from the road, and over the tops of the
  trees, through the misting rain and the night, he made out the dim triangle
  of the roof of the building. In a moment the hoofs of the mare were
  scattering the gravel of the winding road which twisted among the trees, and
  presently he drew up before the house.</p>

  <p>The face of it, as was to be expected at this hour of the night, was
  utterly blank, utterly black. Only the windows, here and there, glimmered
  faintly with whatever light they reflected from the stormy night, the panes
  having been polished by the rain water. As he had expected, it was built in
  the fashion of thirty or forty years before. There were little decorative
  turrets at the four comers of the structure and another and larger turret
  springing from the center of the room. He had no doubt that daylight would
  reveal much carved work of the gingerbread variety.</p>

  <p>A huge and gloomy place it was for one girl to occupy! He sprang from the
  saddle and ran up the steps and knocked heavily on the front door. Inside, he
  heard the long echo wander faintly down the hall and then up the stairs, like
  a ghost with swiftly lightening footfall. There was no other reply. So he
  knocked again, more heavily, and, trying the knob of the door, he found it
  locked fast. When he shook it there was the rattle of a chain on the inside.
  The door had been securely fastened, to be sure. This was not the rule in
  this country of wide-doored hospitality.</p>

  <p>Presently there was the sound of a window being opened in the story of the
  house just above him. He looked up, but he could not locate it, since no lamp
  had been lighted inside.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?" called a girl's voice.</p>

  <p>It thrilled Ronicky Doone. He had come so far to warn a man that his life
  was in danger. He was met by this calm voice of a girl.</p>

  <p>"Who I am doesn't matter," said Ronicky Doone. "I've come to find Hugh
  Dawn. Is he here?"</p>

  <p>There was a slight pause, a very slight pause, and one which might have
  been interpreted as meaning any of a dozen things. Then: "No, Hugh Dawn is
  not here."</p>

  <p>"Lady," said Ronicky Doone, "are you Geraldine Dawn?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the voice. "I am she."</p>

  <p>"I've heard of you," said Ronicky; "and I've heard of Hugh Dawn. I know
  that he's in this house. What I want to do is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Whatever you want to do," broke in that amazingly mild voice, "you will
  have to wait till morning. I am alone in this house. I do not intend to have
  it entered before daylight comes. Hugh Dawn a not here. If you know anything
  about him, you also know that he hasn't been here for ten years."</p>

  <p>And there was the sound of a window being closed with violence.</p>

  <p>To persist in efforts at persuasion in the face of such a calm
  determination was perfect folly. Besides, there were many explanations.
  Perhaps Jack Moon had heard simply that Hugh Dawn was coming back to his
  home, and the traitor to the band had not yet arrived at his destination.
  Perhaps at that moment the leader was heading straight for a distant point on
  the road to lay an ambush. "Dawn is in Trainor," he had said, but that might
  be a metaphorical statement. It might simply mean that he was on the way
  toward the town. Or perhaps the fugitive had received a warning and had
  already fled. At any rate, Ronicky Doone felt that he had done more than
  enough to free his conscience.</p>

  <p>But there was one thing that upset this conviction as Ronicky swung back
  into his saddle and turned the head of weary Lou back down the road through
  the pines. This was the memory of the voice of the girl. There is no index of
  character so perfect and suggestive as the voice, and that of Jerry Dawn was
  soft, quiet, steady. It had neither trembled with fear nor shrilled with
  indignation. If any of the blood of Hugh Dawn ran in her veins, then surely
  the man could not be altogether bad.</p>

  <p>Of course, this was wild guesswork at best, but it carried a conviction to
  Ronicky, and when, halfway down to the main road, he remembered how Jack Moon
  had returned to the door of the barn to investigate a suspicion which was
  based on nothing but the most shadowy material&mdash;when, above all, he
  recalled how justified that suspicion was&mdash;Ronicky Doone determined to
  imitate the maneuver. For were there not reasons why the girl should refuse
  to admit that this man Hugh Dawn&mdash;her father, perhaps&mdash;had returned
  to his house?</p>

  <p>No sooner had the determination come to Doone than he turned the head of
  his horse and swerved back toward the house for a second time. He now rode
  off the noisy gravel, walking Lou in the silent mold beneath the trees; and
  so he came back again to the edge of the clearing. Here he tethered the mare,
  skirted under shelter of the trees halfway around the house, and then ran
  swiftly out of the forest and up to the steep shelter of the wall of the
  dwelling. Here he paused to take breath and consider again what he had done
  and the possibilities that lay before him.</p>

  <p>He could have laughed at the absurdity of what he had done. He was, in
  reality, stalking a big house which contained no more than one poor girl,
  badly frightened already, no doubt, in spite of that steady and brave voice.
  What he was actually doing was spying on the possibility of Hugh
  Dawn&mdash;trying to force himself on the man in order to save his life!</p>

  <p>Very well. He would be a sane and thinking man once more. The devil might
  now fly away with Hugh Dawn for all of him. Let there be an end of this
  foolishness, Ronicky Doone would turn his back on Dawn and all connected with
  him. His own path led otherwhere.</p>

  <p>He had made up his mind to this point and was turning away, when he heard
  that within the house which made him stop short and flatten his ear against
  the wall.</p>

  <p>It has already been said that sound and echoes traveled easily in that
  frame building, with its time-dried wood. And now what Ronicky Doone heard
  was a slow repetition of creaking sounds one after another, moving through
  the second story of the building. He recognized the intervals; he recognized
  the nature of the squeaking and straining. Some very heavy person was moving
  by stealth, slowly, down one of the upper halls.</p>

  <p>Certainly it was not the girl who had spoken to him. Could it be Hugh
  Dawn? Or was it a member of Moon's band, who might have slipped into the
  building from the rear, say?</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone intended to investigate.</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap04"
     name="chap04">IV. WARNING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">He began at once to search for a means of entrance.
Ordinarily he would
  have attempted to get in through one of the windows of the basement, but when
  he tried them, he found every one staunchly secured from within, and when he
  attempted to turn the catch with the blade of his knife, he could not
  succeed. The locks had been rusted strongly in place.</p>

  <p>Since he could not take the bottom way in, he would take an upper. Yonder,
  the turret which projected from the upper corner of the building was
  continued all the way to the ground through the three stories of the house in
  a set of bow windows. The result was that between the angle of the projecting
  windows and the wall of the house itself there were scores of footholds,
  precarious and small to an inexpert climber, but to athletic Ronicky Doone as
  safe as walking up a stairway.</p>

  <p>The chance to use his muscles, moreover, after this chilling wait, was
  welcome to him, and he went up with the agility of a monkey until he reached
  the smaller window on the third story of the structure. Here he clambered
  onto the projecting sill and tried to lift the window. It was locked as
  securely as those of the basement. There was only the chance that it might
  have been used more recently and had not been rusted into place.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, he opened his stout-bladed knife again and inserted it in the
  crack between the upper and the lower sash, feeling along toward the center
  until he reached the little metal crossbar which made the windows secure. It
  resisted the first tentative pressure. But the second and more vigorous
  effort made the lock give with a faint squeaking sound. In another instant
  Ronicky had raised the window and thrust his head into the room.</p>

  <p>His whole body followed at once, and, lowering himself cautiously into the
  room, he found himself at last definitely consigned to the adventure,
  whatever it might bring forth.</p>

  <p>A new atmosphere had at once surrounded him. The air was warmer, less
  fresh, drier. But more than all these things, it was filled with the
  personality, so to speak, of human beings. The darkness had a quality not
  unlike that of a human face. It watched Ronicky Doone; it listened to him as
  he crouched by the wall and waited and listened.</p>

  <p>For now, no matter how innocent his errand, the people of the house, if
  indeed there were more than the girl present, would be amply justified in
  treating as a criminal a man who had forced his way into their home. If he
  were shot on sight the law would not by the weight of a single finger attempt
  to punish the slayers. And still he persisted in the adventure.</p>

  <p>Eventually, by whatever uneasy light filtered from the night and through
  the window, he made out that the room in which he stood was utterly bare of
  furniture of any kind. It was deserted. By the soft feel of dust beneath his
  shoe he shrewdly guessed that it had been deserted a matter of many years,
  and when he tried the boards with his weight his conjecture was further
  reinforced by the whisper which replied, and which would have grown into a
  prodigious squeak had he allowed his whole weight to fall.</p>

  <p>This particular made his exit from the room a delicate matter. He managed
  it without noise only by staying close to the edge of the wall, where the
  flooring, being here firmly attached, could not possibly have any great play.
  Facing out to the center of the room, since in this manner he could slide
  closest to the wall, he managed to get to the hall door of the room and
  thence into the hall without making a whisper loud enough to have caught the
  attentive ear of a cat.</p>

  <p>Once there he paused again, swaying a little, so lightly was he poised,
  with the rhythm of his breathing. The house below was still as the grave, but
  presently it was filled with murmurs. For the wind had freshened and was now
  striking the house with a renewed vigor. His thought flashed back to Lou,
  standing patiently in the shelter of the pines, and then he turned again to
  the work before him.</p>

  <p>It was peculiarly embarrassing. He could not simply stand in the hall and
  shout his good intentions and his warnings. That would be sheer madness.
  There remained nothing but to hunt through the house and hope to find Hugh
  Dawn, surprise him, perhaps cover him with a gun, and then deliver his
  tidings at its point. For otherwise Hugh Dawn, no doubt in terrible fear of
  his old band, would shoot the first stranger on sight.</p>

  <p>Ronicky began to slip down the hall. The noise of the wind, starting a
  thousand creaks in the house, favored his progress immensely. It covered
  other footfalls, to be sure, but it also covered his own. In order that the
  noise he made might be completely blanketed by the shakings of the wind, he
  waited for flurries of the storm and took advantage of them to make swift
  progress forward, then paused through the intervals of comparative
  silence.</p>

  <p>So he rumbled down the upper hall balustrade until it swerved to the right
  and down, leading him onto the stairs. In this way he came down to the second
  story, where, he was sure, he had first heard the footfalls. It was in utter
  darkness. Yet by striving continually to pierce the wall of shadow he had so
  far accustomed his eyes to the strain that he could make out the vague
  proportions of that wide and lofty hall.</p>

  <p>Where the stairs turned easily onto the hall flooring he paused a moment,
  in a lull of the gale, to wait for the next flurry and the crashing of the
  rain against the roof. The moment it began he started once more, turning to
  the right, determined to try each door he came to and so start a gradual
  examination of the house. But he had hardly taken a step on his way when a
  light click sounded close behind him, and then a shaft of light struck past
  his head.</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone whirled and dived down, not away from the direction of the
  light, but toward it, whipping out his revolver as he fell upon his
  supporting left arm. The shaft of light, launched from a pocket electric
  torch, was wandering wildly. Behind it he caught the dimly outlined figure of
  a man. Then the light fell on him as he gathered himself for another leap,
  and a revolver roared straight before him.</p>

  <p>There was a twitch at the shoulder of his coat&mdash;the bullet had come
  as close as that!&mdash;then Ronicky Doone sprang, animallike, from hands to
  knees, swerving out of the flash of the light as the gun spoke again and
  missed again. He struck with his left hand as he shot in. All his force,
  multiplied threefold by nervous ecstasy, went into that whipping punch, and
  the knuckles crunched home against bone. It was a solid impact. The jar of it
  left his arm numb to the shoulder, and the vague outline of the man behind
  the light collapsed.</p>

  <p>As he did so, the electric torch fell from his hand, spinning and filling
  the hall with wild flashings until it struck the floor. The revolver crashed
  to the boards an instant later, and Ronicky, scooping up the light, turned it
  down into the face of his victim.</p>

  <p>It was a big body, lying with the long arms thrown out crosswise, so
  completely stunning had the blow been. Ronicky, estimating the power in that
  now inert bulk, was grateful that his first punch had struck home. In a
  struggle hand to hand he would not have had a chance for victory.</p>

  <p>Somewhere in the distance there was a woman's shrill cry of terror.
  Ronicky paid little heed to it, for he was too busy examining that upturned
  face. His victim was a man of about forty-five, with a seamed and lined face,
  clean shaven, rather handsome, and sadly worn by the passage of time and many
  troubles, no doubt. But the expression was neither savage nor sneaking. The
  forehead was broad and high with noble capacity for thought. The nose was
  strongly but not cruelly arched. The mouth was sensitive. If this were Hugh
  Dawn, he was by no means the criminal type as Ronicky Doone knew it, and in
  his wanderings he had known many a yegg, many a robber.</p>

  <p>The knocked-out man began to revive and came suddenly to his senses,
  sitting up and blinking at the dazzling shaft of light. Then he reached for
  his fallen gun, but the foot of Ronicky stamped over it at the same
  instant.</p>

  <p>All this, of course, from the first snapping on of the light, had filled
  only a few seconds. Now the calling of the girl broke out clearly upon them
  as she threw open a door. Ronicky saw her form rushing down toward them and
  heard the rustling of her clothes. There was the dim flicker of a gun in her
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Lady," said Ronicky, holding the electric light far from him, but still
  keeping it focused on the face of the other man so that his own body would be
  in deep comparative shadow. "I'm here for no harm. But mind your gun. If this
  is Hugh Dawn&mdash;if he means anything to you&mdash;mind what you do. I've
  got him covered!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, dad!" cried the girl excitedly. "Are you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not hurt," replied the other. "They've got me, that's all. Stand
  up?"</p>

  <p>"Stand up," said Ronicky. "Are you Hugh Dawn?"</p>

  <p>The other rose. He was even larger than he had seemed when he was lying on
  the floor, and his glance wistfully sought his fallen revolver.</p>

  <p>"I'm Hugh Dawn, right enough," he said. "I don't figure that you knew
  that?" And he sneered mockingly at Ronicky. The girl, despite the warnings of
  Ronicky, had slipped to his side. Now he caught the revolver out of her hand
  and glared at his captor.</p>

  <p>"I see the gun," said Ronicky. "Don't try any play with it, Mr. Dawn. I'm
  sure watching you close. Understand?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded and swallowed. But there was a desperate determination
  about his face that made Ronicky uneasy.</p>

  <p>"Where's&mdash;the chief?" gasped Hugh Dawn. "Where's he?"</p>

  <p>And his glance rolled up and down the hall.</p>

  <p>"Not here," said Ronicky, "but coming."</p>

  <p>The other quaked and then shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Get me straight," said Ronicky. "I've not come here to get you. If I
  wanted to do that I could shoot you down now. I want something else."</p>

  <p>"I know what you want," shouted the other, "but you won't get it! Not if I
  have to die ten times! Never!"</p>

  <p>"What you're talking about," said Ronicky, "I don't know. Here's my yarn;
  believe it or not, as you want to! I lay out in a barn tonight, heard Jack
  Moon and his crew plot to come here and grab you, and rode on around them to
  give you a warning. That's why I'm here. I tried to get through the door. The
  lady, here, wouldn't talk to me. I played a hunch that you might be here,
  anyway. I came back, shinnied up the wall, opened a window, and here I am.
  Does that sound like straight talk to you?"</p>

  <p>"Straight enough," said the other gloomily. "Except that it's a lie. Moon
  and you and the rest&mdash;I know I'm through with my trail. I know that I
  got my back agin' the wall, but I don't care a rap for you all! I won't beg,
  and I won't tell you where Purchass hid his stuff. That's final! Bring on
  Moon. I'll tell him the same thing!"</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap05"
     name="chap05">V. HIS HAT IN THE RING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">What it all meant Ronicky could only vaguely guess. It was
not only the
  death of Dawn that Moon wished. The renegade also possessed a secret which
  the outlaws considered beyond price, and for the retention of this secret the
  man was willing to lay down his life. Naturally enough, the man refused to
  believe that Ronicky was not an agent of the leader.</p>

  <p>"Partner," said Ronicky, "my name's Doone. I ain't very well known up
  around these parts of the range, but down farther south they'll tell you that
  I'm a tolerable square shooter. Maybe I ain't any wonder, but nobody that
  walks on two feet ever accused me of lying. And I give you my word of honor
  that I got nothing to do with Jack Moon or whatever his name is&mdash;him and
  his men. I've come here to tell you the straight of what I heard tonight. I
  rode ahead to warn you to start on your way if you want to start without
  being salted down with lead."</p>

  <p>The other was staggered a little.</p>

  <p>"How come you to beat out Moon?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I've got the fastest trick in the line of hossflesh that ever packed a
  saddle," said Ronicky proudly. "I got half an hour to the good on Moon. But
  you've used up most of that time already. I say, Dawn, if you want to save
  your life and your secret, whatever that is, start riding now!"</p>

  <p>"And jump into the hands of Moon the minute I leave the house?" cried
  Dawn, the perspiration streaming down his face. "No, sir."</p>

  <p>For the first time the girl turned from her father and faced Ronicky. She
  was not beautiful, but she was very pretty. Her hair was sand-colored and
  further faded by the sun. Constant exposure had tanned her dark bronze. But
  her big gray eyes were as bright and as steady as the torch in Ronicky's
  hand. There was something wonderfully honest and wonderfully feminine about
  her whole body and the carriage of her head. Ronicky guessed at once that
  here was a true Western girl who could ride like a man, shoot like a man,
  perhaps, and then at the end of the trail be gentleness itself. She was
  tensed with excitement as she looked to Ronicky now.</p>

  <p>"Dad," she cried suddenly, "I believe every word he's spoken. His name is
  Doone. He has nothing to do with the band. And he's come here out of the
  honest goodness of his heart to warn you of Moon's intentions."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, lady," said Ronicky. "It sure does me proud to hear you say that!
  Dawn, will you come to and see that what she says is the truth? I'll go one
  further. Now, Dawn, we're on even terms. Would one of Moon's men put you
  there?"</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn was staggered, for Ronicky had slipped his revolver back into
  his holster at his right hip. It was worse than an even break for Doone,
  because Dawn held in his hand, bared of the leather, the light thirty-two-
  caliber revolver which he had taken from the girl.</p>

  <p>"Jerry," he said, "I dunno&mdash;I dunno. Moon's more full of tricks than
  a snake is of poison. But maybe this is square. Maybe this gent ain't got a
  thing to do with Moon."</p>

  <p>"Then," cried Ronicky Doone, with a sudden passion, "for Heaven's sake act
  on it! Jump out of this house, saddle your hoss, and ride! Because Moon's
  coming!"</p>

  <p>There was such honest eagerness in his voice that Hugh Dawn started as
  though to execute the suggestion. He only hesitated to say: "How come you to
  do all this riding and talking for me? What d'you get out of it? What am I to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"You're a gent with four crooks on your heels," said Ronicky calmly. "I
  heard them talk. I couldn't let a murder be done if I could keep you from it.
  That's why I'm here."</p>

  <p>The other shook his head. But the girl cried: "Don't you see, dad? He's
  simply&mdash;white! For Heaven's sake, believe him&mdash;trust in my trust.
  Get your things together. I'll saddle the gray and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The storm of her excited belief swept the other off his feet. He flashed
  one glance at Ronicky Doone, then turned on his heel and ran for his
  room.</p>

  <p>The girl raced the other way, clattering down the stairs. Perhaps when she
  sprang outside into the night Jack Moon and his men would already be there.
  But she had never a thought for danger.</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone only delayed to run into the front room on that floor
  &mdash;the room from which the girl had spoken to him when he tried the front
  door&mdash;and there he lighted the lamp and placed it on the table near the
  window. After that he sped down the stairs, untethered Lou from her tree at
  the side of the house, and hurried with her to the back of the house and the
  old, tumble-down horseshed which stood there.</p>

  <p>Lantern light showed there, where the girl was saddling a tall, gray
  gelding. She was working the cinch knots tight as Ronicky appeared, so fast
  had been her work, and now her father came from the house at a run, huddling
  himself into his slicker.</p>

  <p>"How could they find out that I come here?" he asked. "After ten
  years!"</p>

  <p>"No time for questions," his daughter said, panting. "Oh, dad, for
  Heaven's sake use the spurs tonight. Go back. Never return!"</p>

  <p>"And leave you here alone?" asked Ronicky sternly. "Not when Moon and his
  gang are on the way. I seen their faces, lady, and they ain't a pretty lot!
  Leave you to be found by them? Not in a thousand years."</p>

  <p>She grew a little pale at that, but she still kept her head high. "I've
  nothing to fear," she said. "They wouldn't dare harm me."</p>

  <p>"I'll trust 'em dead, not living," said Ronicky. "You're going to ride
  with your father and on that hoss yonder!"</p>

  <p>There was a companion to the gray, hardly so tall, but even better
  formed.</p>

  <p>"He's right," said Hugh Dawn. As he spoke he caught saddle and bridle from
  their hooks and slapped them onto the horse. "I ain't thinking right tonight.
  I ain't understanding things. Doone, you put shame on me! Of course I ain't
  going to leave her alone!"</p>

  <p>Ronicky heard these remarks with only half an ear.</p>

  <p>He called from the door of the shed, where he had taken his stand: "Now
  put out the lantern! No use calling them this way with a light!"</p>

  <p>He was hastily obeyed. Through the darkness they led out the two grays
  beside Lou.</p>

  <p>"And you, Doone," said Hugh Dawn, who seemed to have been recovering his
  poise rapidly during the past seconds, "ride down the east road. We'll go
  over the hills. Tomorrow Jerry can come back, when it's safe.
  And&mdash;Doone, shake hands! I forgive that punch that knocked me cold. Some
  day we&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up," whispered Ronicky Doone impolitely and with savage force.
  "There they come!"</p>

  <p>Four ghostly, silent figures, stooping low, advancing with stealthy
  stride, came out of the pines and slid toward the house. They could not be
  distinguished individually. They were simply blurs in the mist of rainfall,
  but for some reason their very obscurity made them more significant, more
  formidable. Ronicky Doone heard a queer, choked sound&mdash;Hugh Dawn
  swallowing a horror that would not down.</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;and I near stayed there in the house and waited&mdash;for
  this!" he breathed.</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone jerked up a threatening fist. Not that there was a real
  danger that they might be overheard at that distance, but because he had odd
  superstitions tucked away in him here and there, and one of those
  superstitions was that words were more than mere sounds. They were thoughts
  that went abroad in an electric medium and possessed a life of their own.
  They might dart across a great space, these things called words. They might
  enter the minds and souls of men to whom they were not addressed. The idea
  had grown up in Ronicky Doone during long periods of silence in the
  mountains, in the desert where silence itself is a voice.</p>

  <p>That raised fist brought the hunted man's teeth together with a snap. Then
  the gesture of Ronicky commanded them to go forward, on foot, leading their
  horses. He himself went last and acted as the rear guard while they trudged
  out past the horse-shed&mdash;blessing the double night of its
  shadow!&mdash;and up the grade, then swerving around among the trees on the
  narrow uptrail which would eventually take them over the hills. They came
  even with the side of the house.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" breathed Dawn. "They sure ain't got up that high already
  &mdash;but&mdash;they's a light in the front room&mdash;your room,
  Jerry!"</p>

  <p>"I left that lamp," Ronicky Doone told them, grinning. "I thought it'd
  keep 'em nice and quiet for a while and make 'em sneak up to that door slow
  and easy, slow and easy&mdash;then pop! wide goes the door, and they run in
  and find&mdash;nothing!"</p>

  <p>He laughed fiercely, silently&mdash;no sound coming save the light
  catching of his breath.</p>

  <p>"You got a brain," said the rescued man.</p>

  <p>"Heaven bless you!" whispered his daughter.</p>

  <p>"We can climb the hosses now," said Ronicky, who seemed to have been
  admitted into the post of commander. "No danger of being seen. But ride slow.
  Things that move fast are seen a pile quicker than things that stand still.
  Now!"</p>

  <p>He gave the example of swinging into the saddle on Lou. The girl, as she
  imitated, went up lightly as a feather, but Hugh Dawn's great bulk brought a
  loud grunt from the gray he bestrode, and the three sat a moment, straining
  in fear. But there was no sound. The four shadows had melted into the greater
  shadow of the house.</p>

  <p>They began at a walk. They climbed higher on the swinging trail among the
  trees until they were above another eminence and looked down. The house
  seemed as near as ever, the trail had zigzagged so much to make the altitude.
  They could see the front of the building clearly, and suddenly the light
  wobbled, flashed to the side, and almost went out; then it grew dimmer in the
  center of the apartment.</p>

  <p>"They've found out the trick," said Ronicky Doone, speaking in a natural
  voice and chuckling.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" panted the girl.</p>

  <p>"We can talk out now, long's we don't do no shouting. They've sprung the
  trap, and they've got nothing! Not a thing!" He laughed again.</p>

  <p>"Thanks to you, partner," said Hugh Dawn. "Thanks to you, lad!" There was
  a ring to his low voice.</p>

  <p>The girl added a pleasant grace note to what her father had said: "To
  think," she said, "that when you spoke from the door&mdash;such a little time
  ago!&mdash;I was paralyzed with fear. I thought you were they. I thought they
  had come for dad! And&mdash;well, every day that he lives from now on, is a
  day due to you, Mr. Doone; and he will never forget. I will never
  forget."</p>

  <p>For some reason that assurance that she would never forget meant more to
  Ronicky Doone than any assurance from the grown man.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "you don't owe nothing to me. It's Lou that done it.
  It's Lou that outfooted their hosses and give me the half hour's head start.
  She piled that up inside of twenty miles' running, too, and after she'd gone
  a weary way yesterday. Yep, if you got anything to thank, it's Lou. Me, I
  just done what anybody'd do. I'll leave you folks here," he added, as he got
  to the top of the crest of the hills with them.</p>

  <p>"Leave us? Oh, no!" cried the girl and added hastily: "But of course. You
  see, I forget, Mr. Doone. It seems that so many things have happened to the
  three of us tonight that we are all bound together."</p>

  <p>"I wish we were," said Hugh Dawn. "But you got your business, lad.
  Besides, I bring bad luck. Stay clear of me, or you'll have the back luck,
  too!"</p>

  <p>Ronicky's esteem of the man rose up the scale.</p>

  <p>"Folks," he said kindly, "I'm one of them with nothing on my hands but a
  considerable lot of time and an itch for action. Seems to me that there may
  be some more action before this game's done and over, and I'd sort of like to
  horn in and have my say along with you, Dawn&mdash;if you want me and need
  me, I mean!"</p>

  <p>Dawn answered: "It's on your own head, if you do. Doone, I'm in fear of
  death. But&mdash;need you? Why, man, I have the greatest thing in the world
  to do, and I'm single-handed in the doing of it. That's all. But if you'll
  take the chance, why, I'll trust you, and I'll let you in on the ground
  floor. But if you come with me, lad, you'll be taking the chances. You'll be
  playing for millions of dollars. But you'll be putting up your life in the
  gamble. How does that sound to you? But remember that if you come along with
  me, you get Jack Moon and his tribe of bloodhounds on your trail, and if they
  ever come up with you, you're dead. Understand?"</p>

  <p>"Dad," cried the girl, "I'm burning with shame to hear you
  talk&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's his concern!" declared her father. "Let him talk out. D'you know
  what I'm talking about? Millions, girl, millions&mdash;not just mere
  thousands! Millions in bullion!"</p>

  <p>"Millions of fun," and Ronicky Doone laughed. "That's what it sounds like
  to me."</p>

  <p>"Then," said the older man eagerly, "suppose we shake on it!"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" cried Jerry Dawn. She even rode in between them.</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean, Jerry?" asked her father impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Oh," she said, "every one has tried the cursed thing, and every one has
  gone down; and now you take in the one generous and kind and pure-hearted man
  who has ever come into our lives. You take him, and you begin to drag him
  down in the net. Oh, Dad, is this a reward for him? Is this a reward for
  him?"</p>

  <p>There was almost a sob in her voice.</p>

  <p>"Lady," said Ronicky Doone, "you're sure kind, but I've made up my mind.
  Remember that story about Bluebeard's wife? She had all the keys but one, and
  she plumb busted her heart because she couldn't get that one key and see
  inside that one room. Well, lady, the same's true with me. Suppose I had the
  key to everything else in the world and just this one thing was left that I
  could get at; well, I'd turn down all the other things in the world that I
  know about and take to this one thing that I don't know anything about, just
  because I don't know it. Danger? Well, lady, danger is the finest bait in the
  world for any gent like me that's fond of action and ain't never been fed
  full on it. That's the straight of it."</p>

  <p>"Then," said the girl sadly, "Heaven forgive us for bringing this down on
  your generous heart!" And she drew her horse back.</p>

  <p>The two men reached through the dark night and the rain. Their wet, cold
  hands fumbled, met, and closed in a hard grasp. It was like a flash of light,
  that gripping of the hands. It showed them each other's minds as a glint of
  light would have shown their faces.</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap06"
     name="chap06">VI. A PAUSE FOR REST</a></h2>

  <p class="first">As the trio plodded on steadily through the night, many
things about the
  father and daughter impressed Ronicky Doone favorably.</p>

  <p>There was something so fine, sat naturally well-bred about their whole
  attitude, that he felt his heart warming to both; and yet there were reasons
  enough for him to maintain an attitude of suspicion and caution so far as the
  pair was concerned. He was calling the girl "Jerry" before the ride was
  ended; both father and daughter were calling him "Ronicky." Those were the
  chief conversational results of the night.</p>

  <p>The ride lasted all the night and well on into the morning. Lou, great-
  heart that she was, bore up wonderfully. She had the endurance of an Arab
  horse, and indeed she resembled an Arab in her staunch and tapering build.
  The big grays struck a hard pace and kept to it, but Lou matched them with
  her smooth-flowing gait. Her head went down a little as time passed, but when
  the dawn came, gray and cold under a rainless sky, it showed her still with
  an ample reserve of strength, while the grays were well-nigh as fagged as
  though they had covered all her distance of miles in the past twenty-four
  hours.</p>

  <p>For the sake of Ronicky's horse, knowing the distance the mare had
  covered, the Dawns would have stopped the journey for rest, but Ronicky would
  not hear of it. As he pointed out, Jack Moon could not attempt to pick up the
  trail until the morning; and then he probably would only be able to locate it
  by striking out in a great circle with the house as the center of his
  sweeping radius. If they pushed straight ahead, stopping only when they had
  put a solid day's march behind them, they would doubtless pass well beyond
  the reach of that radius, particularly since the outlaws would be looking for
  the signs of two horses instead of three. These reasons were so patent that
  they were accepted, and so the party held on its way.</p>

  <p>By midmorning they came in sight of a village among the hills to their
  left. Ronicky&mdash;because he would not be recognized by Moon's scouts in
  case they inquired after Dawn in that place&mdash;rode down into the town and
  bought supplies; then he rejoined the group on the trail four miles out from
  the village, and they pressed on for another hour. The sight of a little
  ruined shack here proved too strong a temptation for them, and they
  determined to make their day's halt. They were too tired to prepare a meal.
  Canned beans, crackers, and coffee were their portion. They slept wrapped in
  their blankets.</p>

  <p>At four in the afternoon Ronicky wakened to find that Hugh Dawn was
  already up. He had kindled a fire in the wrecked stove which, without a
  chimney, stood in one corner of the shack; and now he sat beside it, his
  hands wrapped about his knees, a big black pipe clenched between his teeth,
  and his eyes fixed, through the doorway, upon the south trail. The broad
  shoulders, which could not be pulled forward even by the draw of the arms in
  this position; the forward thrust of the heavy head and the powerful neck;
  the solemn and alert expression of the face&mdash;all of these things went to
  convince Ronicky, as he lay unstirring for a moment in his blankets, that his
  new-found companion was by no means a soft variety of adventurer. The night
  before he had shown himself in the most unfavorable, and almost a cowardly,
  light. But no doubt that was explained as a result of a long hounding&mdash;
  explained by the fact that he was returning from safety into a region where
  his life would constantly be in danger.</p>

  <p>Ronicky could not help admiring the quiet with which the man had been able
  to light the fire and break up wood and handle the noisy plates of the stove
  without making sufficient disturbance to waken either him&mdash;a remarkably
  light sleeper at all times&mdash;or the girl.</p>

  <p>She lay in the position she had taken when she first wrapped herself in
  the blankets, her face turned up and pillowed in the tumbled masses of her
  hair. But on her lips, strangely enough, there was the smile of complete
  happiness and joyous dreams. Ronicky saw the face of the father, as it turned
  for an instant to the girl, soften wonderfully and lose every stern line.
  Again his heart warmed to the man.</p>

  <p>He sat up in his blankets, was greeted by a smile and a silent raising of
  the hand, and, after folding his blanket, went outside to find water. He
  discovered a place a hundred yards away, where a little freshet had pooled
  its waters in a small lake, and that tempted him to a swim. He came back from
  his bath and shave, and saw that the father had not changed his position.
  Only iron muscles and a mind wrapped in the profoundest meditations could
  have kept him in that cramping posture.</p>

  <p>At sight of Ronicky he rose, and, crossing the rotted boards of the floor
  with marvelous softness, considering his bulk, he came out to greet his new
  friend.</p>

  <p>"What I been thinking," he said, after he had drawn Ronicky far enough
  away to be out of earshot of the girl, "is that we better get ready for a
  start and go on, leaving Jerry a note to say that she's better at the house
  than she is with us. What do you think of that?"</p>

  <p>"Only one thing," said Ronicky Doone, after a moment of consideration.
  "Does Jerry know where you're bound?"</p>

  <p>"In a general way she does."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Ronicky, "if she knows in a general way, she's apt to follow
  on and try to find us. Or, if she doesn't do that, she'll go back to the big
  house and die of loneliness, wondering what's happening to you. And at the
  house, who knows if Moon won't drop in on her, and take some means of finding
  out from her where you've gone&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>"It'd take torture to get that out of her."</p>

  <p>"That's just what I mean."</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn started.</p>

  <p>Ronicky explained: "I only saw his face once. You must know him a pile
  better than I do. But I got this to say, that if ever I saw a cold-blooded
  devil in the form of a man, Jack Moon is him. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>"A thousand times right!" and Hugh Dawn sighed. "But I've been so long
  away&mdash;I've looked back on the West as a place where women at least are
  sacred&mdash;that I plumb forgot what a fiend Moon is. Ronicky, you're
  correct. We can't leave the girl. But if we take her with us, won't she run
  into the same danger?"</p>

  <p>"No, because if she's with us she'll not have any information to give
  Moon&mdash;nothing to be browbeaten about or hurt. I take it that if he finds
  us where we're going, he'll know everything."</p>

  <p>"I guess so," said the older man, knotting his brows anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Unless," suggested Ronicky, "you can afford to send her back and get the
  protection of the law for her; but I gather that you don't want to bring
  yourself to the notice of the law much more than you want to bring yourself
  to the notice of Jack Moon."</p>

  <p>"Right!" The big man nodded sadly. "That's just the place I stand in. Poor
  Jerry! Ronicky, they's a curse on this treasure we're after. Maybe Jerry's
  right. I was all wrong to bring you in on it. But, playing my lone hand, I
  was pretty sure I could never beat Moon. With you I figured that we'd all
  have a chance&mdash;of being rich!"</p>

  <p>Ronicky nodded.</p>

  <p>"And I suppose you want to know something, Ronicky, about me and the
  treasure and Moon and all?"</p>

  <p>"I want to know just as much as comes easy for you to tell me, Dawn."</p>

  <p>"To begin with, what d'you know already?"</p>

  <p>"Only bits that I gathered, which round up to something like this: That
  once you belonged to Moon's crowd. That you broke away from the crowd ten
  years ago. That in Moon's crew the punishment for desertion is death. That
  you ran out of the country to keep clear of him. That he worked hard to get
  on your trail all the time. That the minute you got back, he learned about
  it. That he's trying to kill you now. That you came back here partly because
  you wanted to see the girl. That another thing brought you back, which was
  this treasure you talk about. That's much as I know, or think I know. Am I
  right? Mind you, I ain't asking for a thing that comes hard for you to tell.
  Every gent has shadowy places in his life. I have 'em. Everybody has 'em."
  The other man drank in the words hungrily.</p>

  <p>"What you've said," he declared eagerly, "makes it plumb easy to talk to
  you compared with anybody else I've ever knowed. I've only got this to say,
  that I'm going to make a clean breast of everything to you. It'll take time,
  but we got time. Jerry needs another hour for rest. Girls ain't like men.
  They get plumb no-good unless they have their sleep. Speaking of Jerry, I got
  to say that she don't know the half of what I'm going to tell you&mdash;and I
  don't expect her ever to learn anything more from you."</p>

  <p>"Partner," said Ronicky, "I understand."</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap07"
     name="chap07">VII. THE TREASURE TALE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Dawn cast about in his mind for an easy method of opening a
rather
  difficult narrative. It was essential that he should not lose the respect of
  his new-found ally; for he sensed at once the vital truth that Ronicky Doone
  could not work for an instant with a companion whom he did not trust.</p>

  <p>At length he hit upon a lucky beginning and pointed down the hillside.</p>

  <p>"You see that old pine tree down there on the side of the hill among the
  rocks?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And you see that other one on the level shoulder? Well, one of 'em is
  packed in among rocks and hasn't a square chance to grow; and even when it
  grows, it pitches out to the side, all crooked. And the other goes up big and
  straight as a king, eh? Ronicky, it's the same way with humans. Take two men
  of the same kind and give one a chance and one a hard row. One of 'em goes
  straight, the other goes crooked. Well, Ronicky, that's my case.</p>

  <p>"My father built that big house you saw last night, and I grew up in it.
  He was a moneymaker, an easygoing fellow, too, and he liked to spend money as
  well as he liked to make it. Mines were his meat, and you know how cheap you
  regard gold that you dig out of dirt. He treated me the same way he treated
  himself. I grew up just the way I felt like growing. He didn't make me do
  anything. I didn't feel like going off to school, and he didn't make me.
  Result was that I just ran wild, got to be a man, married the finest girl
  that ever stepped, had a girl born&mdash;and then the mines went smash, and
  dad went smash with them. Left me stranded. I didn't have any occupation. I
  didn't know anything about ranch work, even. And how was I to support my
  family? Then came a hard winter. My father and my wife died and left me with
  the baby girl to take care of. That hit me pretty hard. When your wife goes
  hungry it's bad enough; but when a kid cries for food, it sure cuts you
  up.</p>

  <p>"I started out to get coin. And I got it! Tried my hand at gambling, and I
  had a beginner's luck that lasted me two years. Then that luck petered out,
  and I was flat as ever&mdash;and nothing saved of all the money I'd made.</p>

  <p>"When I was down and out, Jack Moon met me. He'd been watching me for a
  long time like the fox that he is. He saw me going downhill and he waited for
  the right time. When it came, he was ready. He put up his game to me, and I
  fell for it. I was desperate, you see? And the way he told me was that I
  wouldn't have to ride with him more'n a couple of times a year. The only hard
  thing was that, once in the band, I had to stay with it all my life. But even
  that I was willing to do, because there was Jerry, nearly eight years old,
  pretty as a picture, and needing a pile of things to keep her happy. So I
  gave Moon my word and went in with him.</p>

  <p>"He didn't call on me for six months. Meantime, he gave me money, kept me
  easy, and built up a big debt that I owed him. End of the six months he
  called on me. It was a safe-blowing job. I rode with Moon and two others, and
  I didn't do much but look on; but afterward I got a split on the profits.
  Well, Ronicky, that night when I saw the soup explode and the door of the
  safe blown off, it seemed to me I was seeing the whole power of the law blown
  to the devil. It was more'n I could stand. I got Moon aside and told him that
  I was pretty well tired of the whole thing and I wanted to turn in my share
  to pay off my debts to him and get myself out of the band. But Moon only
  laughed at me. He said that every man was a little hard hit his first time
  out, but afterward he got used to it. Besides, he said that I had the makings
  of a new leader, if anything happened to him; and he tried to flatter me into
  being happy.</p>

  <p>"It didn't work, but he said enough to show me that he'd never let me get
  out of his control. That started me thinking faster and harder than I'd ever
  thought before.</p>

  <p>"About two months later he called on me. I can see now that he simply
  wanted to test me out. He said he knew that I was a hard rider and a good
  shot, and he said, too, that he was going to honor me by giving me the job of
  running down a skunk that had tried to double-cross his band. This was the
  story that Moon told me, and I'll try to give you every point just as he gave
  'em to me.</p>

  <p>"A good many years back, they made the gold strikes along the Jervey
  River&mdash;you've heard about 'em?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!" Ronicky nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, those strikes were about the richest ever made, according to what
  Moon told me. The boys dug out the gold like dirt. They got it by the
  millions. It was all surface stuff, and the claims gave out quick; but while
  they lasted &mdash;about two years and a half&mdash;they were mints. The
  chief trouble with the mines along the Jervey was that they wasn't any
  railroad within three hundred miles, and the gold had to be carted out on
  mules and hosses along the trails across the mountains. Naturally there was a
  lot of robbing and holdups going on&mdash;such a pile of it that nobody could
  say how much gold was lost or how many men murdered in the business. But Jack
  Moon says that out of about sixty millions taken from the Jervey claims, not
  more'n twenty millions ever was got across the mountains by them that shipped
  it out!</p>

  <p>"Forty millions was lost. Think of that! You'd think that losses like that
  would have brought out the whole United States army to look after things. But
  the whole army wasn't very big in those days, and it was tolerable busy with
  the Indians. Besides, when the stories got East, they weren't believed; or if
  they were believed, nobody cared very much. They were used to hearing all
  kinds of wild tales about gold coming out of the West, and most generally
  they figured that the gold diggers were a set of rascals, one about as bad as
  the other. So nothing was done till the miners done it.</p>

  <p>"They bore up for a long time, until after a while pretty nigh none of the
  gold ever got across the mountains. Then they stopped digging and got ready
  to fight, and they were about as good at one thing as the other. They meant
  trouble, and they meant trouble in heaps. In a couple of weeks something
  broke. They sent out a fake gold convoy. There wasn't any gold, but there
  were ten mules and only ten men&mdash;and behind the ten came close to fifty
  with rifles. Sure enough, the ten were jumped, there was a big fight, and
  half a dozen of the robbers were shot down. The miners were so mad that they
  didn't leave 'em live long. But one gent kept a spark of life, and he lived
  long enough to tell 'em that the whole system of robbing was run under one
  head, and that that head was the gent that was sheriff of the district where
  the mines was! The skunk had worked a double game and won both ways. His name
  was Hampden.</p>

  <p>"Them fifty men went back to the claims and rounded up Hampden. At first
  he put up quite a talk; but they faced him with the dying gent, and he
  weakened. He was smooth as oil, but there was some things that he couldn't
  answer. When they searched his cabin and found under the flooring some guns
  that was known to belong to gents that had been murdered on the gold trails,
  they give that sheriff a short time for living.</p>

  <p>"His nerve held good till they tied the knot around under his ear and got
  him ready for the swing, and then he buckled. He begged 'em to give him a
  chance. He swore that he wasn't any more than a tool, and that the gent that
  had planned all the organized robbery was really to blame, and that if they'd
  spare his life he'd take them to that gent and they could not only get him
  that was the root of the whole affair, but they could get the gold that had
  been stolen&mdash;a third or half of it, anyway, because that was the share,
  he said, that the master kept for himself.</p>

  <p>"Of course the vigilantes figured this talk to be just plumb fear. Hampden
  wanted to live, and so he was lying and putting the blame on somebody that
  didn't exist. Anyway, they cut him short by kicking the box from under him,
  and Hampden swung still trying to talk and explain as long as he had a breath
  in him.</p>

  <p>"Now let's go back to Jack Moon. He heard about this story; and he had an
  idea that they was something in it. Seems he hunted around for ten years
  trying to locate who the master mind had been, if there was such a man; and
  finally he hit on a gent named Boyd Cosslett that lived in a cabin right up
  on a cliff over the Cunningham River. He was a queer old gent with yards of
  white beard, and always packing the Bible around and living quiet. What
  started the suspicions of Moon was that no letters and no money ever come in
  for old Boyd Cosslett, but every now and then he went down to town and bought
  supplies, and what he paid down was always raw gold or dust!</p>

  <p>"Well, Moon had him watched for nigh onto a year, trying to see if the old
  boy would ever leave his cabin and go out to his treasure&mdash;if he really
  had a treasure buried some place. But nothing happened, so one day he took a
  couple of the boys, Whitwell and another, and rushed Cosslett's shack at
  night.</p>

  <p>"The old miser must of had the ears of a fox. He heard 'em coming. When
  they smashed through the door, they found him closing something into an iron
  box on the table. Moon shot him twice with his revolver, but Cosslett lived
  long enough to snap his box shut and throw it into the river. Then he turned
  around and laughed and shook his fist at Moon and dropped.</p>

  <p>"They looked out the window and saw that the box must of fallen straight
  over the cliff and down into the lake, because that's the place where the
  Cunningham River widens out and fills the ravine and makes Cunningham
  Lake.</p>

  <p>"Cosslett lived about an hour, and Moon tried to make him talk; but the
  old boy just lay reading his Bible out loud and waiting for death.</p>

  <p>"After he died, they buried him all proper. Moon's a stickler for things
  like that. Then they went down and dragged the lake to get the iron box,
  because they figured that it must contain something they could use as a clue
  to finding the treasure. But the bottom of that lake was thick with mud, and
  they got nothing but tired arms for their work.</p>

  <p>"Now, about a month after this Whitwell disappeared, and they didn't find
  him for a long time. And he stayed away so long that Moon knew he had quit
  the band. After a while they pick up his trail and find him not far from
  Cosslett's cabin. And there they find him dragging the lake!</p>

  <p>"It's easy to figure what he was doing. He was trying to get his hands on
  that iron box of old Cosslett's and he wanted to get it for himself and not
  have to share up with the band. Moon let him stay on there for a month,
  hoping that maybe Whitwell would find the box; and then they'd kill Whitwell
  and take the box from him. But Whitwell didn't have any luck, it seemed, so
  finally Moon came to me and gave me the job of killing Whitwell.</p>

  <p>"I tried to beg out of it, but there was nothing to do but go and kill or
  else get killed myself. That was the rule under Jack Moon, and that's the
  rule under him still.</p>

  <p>"When I reached Cunningham Lake, I found that Whitwell was gone; but I
  picked up a fresh trail and followed it two days. It brought me up at last to
  an old deserted camp, and there I nailed Whitwell. There wasn't anything to
  it. He was sound asleep in a chair. When he woke up, I had my gun shoved
  under his chin.</p>

  <p>"Well, he didn't even so much as blink. He just sat up and grinned at me.
  First thing he said was: 'I'm ready to divvy up, if that's what you want.
  '</p>

  <p>"'Divvy up on what?' I asked him.</p>

  <p>"'The box, ' says he. 'I found it.'</p>

  <p>"That took my breath. I'd heard so much from Moon, he seemed so sure that
  that box held the clue to the treasure, that I gaped at Whitwell. He went on
  to talk smooth and easy. He figured that I'd come along for him. He admitted
  that I had him, and that I could blow his head off, but what was the good? I
  told him, and I told him true, that I couldn't kill him, that the job had
  been forced on me, and that I hated Moon and the rest of his band. That was
  music to Whitwell. He told me the whole story right off. He'd found the box
  by dragging. But it was heavy; weighed forty pounds, even if it was small. He
  tried to break it open, but he didn't have a sledge hammer; and while he was
  trying to smash the lock against a rock he saw somebody coming up the river
  road. He took his glasses and made out that it was me.</p>

  <p>"He knew, of course, why I was after him. He saddled and jumped onto his
  horse. But he couldn't take that heavy box with him, so he left it behind at
  Cosslett's house and then tore off across the hills. What he intended to do
  was to shake me off the trail, get some giant powder, return and blow up the
  box, and then see what was to be seen.</p>

  <p>"Now he offered to share everything with me. I thanked him, and we were
  shaking hands to seal the bargain when a gun was fired through the window,
  and Whitwell was shot out of his chair.</p>

  <p>"Of course Moon had just been trying me out, and when he sent me on the
  trail he sent a tried man after me to see what I did. He had orders to simply
  kill me if I tried to dodge the work. And that was what his man tried to do,
  because the second Whitwell spilled out of his chair, another shot was sent
  at me and just clipped through my hair. I dropped to the floor beside
  Whitwell. My ear was close to his lips. I heard him whisper: 'Under the
  veranda, ' and then he was dead.</p>

  <p>"In the meantime, the front door of the cabin opened, and big Si Treat
  came in. He figured that he'd killed us both with those two shots, from the
  way we'd both dropped. There was nothing for it but to get him out of the
  way. I shot for his legs, saw him go down, and then I scrambled through the
  door and rode like mad for Cunningham Lake.</p>

  <p>"But I never got there. Treat hadn't come alone. Moon and two others were
  with him, and they rode like devils to cut me off. They did it and turned me
  into the south mountains. For a month they hunted me, and for a month I
  managed to keep out of bullet range. By that time I was away south, and I saw
  that the country was too hot for me. I could never get back to Jerry. They'd
  watch around her and lay for me. There was only one thing left and that was
  to get as far away as I could, start to work, and support Jerry.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't send for her, because the minute she left that devil Moon
  would trail her to me. I just had to live where I was and work and send her
  the money to live on. And that's what I did. Ten years of it, lad, without
  ever seeing her face. But I gave her enough for an education. Then when she
  was independent I made up my mind that I'd come back and risk the chance to
  get Cosslett's gold. I came back then, told Jerry simply that I was in danger
  from Moon and his band, and started to plan to get to Cunningham Lake and
  Cosslett's old shack. But before I got well started, you know what happened.
  You arrived in time to drag me out to safety. You arrived in time to give me
  a fighting chance at that money&mdash;and give yourself a chance at the same
  thing!"</p>

  <p>"And Jerry knows&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Only that we're trying to get that iron box. She knows the story behind
  that, and how Moon killed the old man. She knows that I can't call down the
  law on the head of Moon because there are complications; but just what those
  complications are, she can't say. Is it all clear to you now, Ronicky, just
  how we stand?"</p>

  <p>"All clear, I guess," said Doone. "But it looks to me as though there's a
  trail of crimson, spilled all around that gold of Cosslett's. First men were
  killed so that he could get his hands on it. Then other gents were bumped off
  because they were his agents. Then Cosslett was killed because he had the
  gold; and then several other gents were killed because they were trying to
  find out where Cosslett hid the stuff. Now here we go, you and me, and take
  your girl with us; and all three of us walk up and rap at the same door.
  Well, Dawn, it looks like black business to me!"</p>

  <p>"You're losing heart, Ronicky?" asked the elder man gloomily.</p>

  <p>"I'll stay with it as long as the next man," declared Ronicky. "One thing
  I'd like to know. Won't Moon suspect that we're heading for Cosslett's old
  shack? Won't he be apt to drive straight for that place and wait for us
  there?"</p>

  <p>"It's a chance," said Hugh Dawn, "but that's a chance we got to take. Moon
  don't know Whitwell's secret. I'm the only one that knows it except you and
  Jerry."</p>

  <p>"But if he strikes around blind for the trail and doesn't find it," said
  Ronicky, "he might start straight for Cosslett's, and then we'd simply be
  running into the trap. Besides, maybe he guesses that you know
  something."</p>

  <p>"He guesses that Whitwell knew something, and that Whitwell told me. What
  it is, he can't guess. But if he's at Cosslett's&mdash;then that's fate. And
  if fate's agin' us, well be beat any way we look at it. But we won't be beat,
  son. I feel lucky! We can get to Cosslett's inside of two hours of hard
  riding. And Moon ain't apt to get there as quick as that. Then a look under
  the veranda&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what if somebody else has looked there in the last ten years?"</p>

  <p>"Not a chance. That veranda was built close to the ground. If Whitwell put
  it there, he must have put it there because he knew nobody'd look there."</p>

  <p>"Then, Hugh, well start."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Jerry has rested enough by this time!"</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap08"
     name="chap08">VIII. AT COSSLETT'S CABIN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It seemed to Ronicky that there was more than an ordinary
admixture of
  superstition in the nature of Hugh Dawn. If fate aided him, he would get
  Cosslett's gold. If fate were against him, he would get death instead. So he
  went ahead blindly trusting in luck. He had made only one sensible provision
  to meet danger, and that was enlisting the aid of another man, Ronicky
  himself. The more Ronicky thought of the affair, the more of a wild-goose
  chase it seemed to him.</p>

  <p>Yet he knew that it was madness to attempt to dissuade Hugh Dawn, and he
  dared not let the big fellow go on with his daughter to face Moon. And face
  the outlaw chief he knew they would, before the adventure was finished.</p>

  <p>Returning to the cabin, they found Geraldine Dawn already up, and they
  found, moreover, that she had reached the conclusion to which they had
  already come. She dared not go back and live alone in the big house of her
  father; a thousand times she would rather continue the trip and face whatever
  lay before them, than make the return.</p>

  <p>Only one thing upset her&mdash;what would the people of Trainor say when
  she did not appear to teach the school? But there was, in the village, a girl
  who had substituted for her once before during an illness. Therefore the
  classes would be taken care of. With that scruple cared for&mdash;how slight
  a thing it seemed to Ronicky Doone!&mdash;she was ready to face the
  adventure.</p>

  <p>They started on within a few minutes, swerving now to the left and
  striking through rougher mountain trails. Hugh Dawn had correctly estimated
  the distance. In the early evening they came upon Cosslett's cabin.</p>

  <p>It stood in an imposing place on the cliff above Cunningham Lake. On all
  sides the ground sloped back. There were no trees near, though in all other
  directions the forest stepped down from the mountaintops to the very edge of
  the lake.</p>

  <p>"You see?" exclaimed Hugh Dawn. "The old boy picked a place where he could
  look on all sides of him. He wouldn't trust a forest where gents could sneak
  up on him."</p>

  <p>Ronicky smiled to himself. Such reasoning simply proved that Dawn had
  already convinced himself, and was willing to pick up minute circumstances
  and weave them into the train of proof.</p>

  <p>They climbed the slope and found that ten years had dealt hard with the
  little house. The roof was smashed in. The sides caved out, as though the
  pressure of time were overcoming them. But the first place to which they ran,
  the veranda, showed no opening beneath its floor and the ground.</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn looked at it in despair. The ground, indeed, was flush with the
  top of the flooring.</p>

  <p>"I must of remembered wrong," he muttered, "but it seems to me that in the
  old days they used to be a space between the floor and the hill. I dunno how
  this come!"</p>

  <p>Ronicky had been surveying the site carefully.</p>

  <p>"Maybe the house had settled," he suggested. "We'll tear up the boards and
  see."</p>

  <p>It was easily done. The rotted wood gave readily around the nail-heads,
  and in a minute or two every board had been torn up. But they saw beneath no
  sign of such a thing as a forty-pound iron chest. Hugh Dawn was in
  despair.</p>

  <p>"Maybe somebody else has lived here and found it and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He could not complete the sentence, so great was his disappointment.
  Ronicky, expecting nothing at all, was quite unperturbed. He looked at Jerry
  Dawn. She was as calm as he, but something of pity was in her eyes as she
  looked to her father. Was it possible that she, too, saw through the whole
  hoax and had simply undertaken the ride to appease the hungry eagerness of
  her father?</p>

  <p>"We'll go inside," she suggested.</p>

  <p>They entered the cabin through the front doorway, stepping over the door
  itself, which had fallen on the inside. All within was at the point of
  disintegration. The cast-iron stove was now a red, rusted heap in a corner.
  The falling of a rafter had smashed the bunk where it was built against the
  wall. The boards of the floor gave and creaked beneath their steps. In the
  corners were little yellowed heaps of paper&mdash;old letters, they seemed.
  And on the floor beneath the bunk Jerry Dawn found, face down, and yet with
  every page intact, the Bible which was always mentioned whenever the name of
  Cosslett was brought into conversation.</p>

  <p>When she raised the book, it seemed that she raised the ghost of the old
  white-bearded hermit at the same time. In spite of the ruin, the terrible
  scene rushed back upon the memory of each of the three&mdash;Jack Moon and
  his men tumbling through the door&mdash;the two explosions of guns&mdash;the
  hurling of the casket through the window&mdash;the fall of the hermit.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Hugh Dawn shouted in alarm. Making a careless step with his great
  weight, he had driven his foot crashing and rending through the flooring
  where rain had rotted away the wood except for a mere shell. He scrambled out
  of his trap, half laughing and half alarmed.</p>

  <p>"The old gent had a cellar," said Ronicky, "judging by the way your leg
  went through that floor."</p>

  <p>Jerry Dawn looked up from the Bible, whose yellowed, time-stained leaves
  she had been turning with reverent fingers. The awe went out of her eyes, and
  bright interest came in its place.</p>

  <p>"A cellar?" she asked. "Then let's look at it. Perhaps that's the place
  where he hid all the gold, dad?"</p>

  <p>Her father snorted.</p>

  <p>"Are you trying to make a joke out of this?" he asked heavily. "Hide the
  gold in the cellar! Hide fifteen or twenty million dollars' worth of gold in
  a cellar!"</p>

  <p>"Twenty millions?" gasped Ronicky, beginning to fear for the sanity of his
  companion. "Are you serious about that, Dawn?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? The band must of took a clean forty millions, and out of
  everything that they took, that old hawk, according to Hampden, got fifty per
  cent. He was a business man, right enough! And what's half of forty? Twenty
  millions, boy!"</p>

  <p>That hungry glittering came into his glance again, and Ronicky shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"But we'll see about the cellar." He nodded to Jerry Dawn.</p>

  <p>She leaned to see him put his fingers through a gaping crack between
  boards, work them to a firm grip, and then rip up the whole length of the
  plank. Below them opened the black depth of the cellar. Ronicky lighted a
  match and dropped it into the aperture.</p>

  <p>"Six foot of hole," he announced. "Down I go!"</p>

  <p>Two more boards were torn away, and he prepared to lower himself.</p>

  <p>"But what good does all that foolishness do?" groaned the despairing
  fortune hunter. "If the box ain't under the veranda&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ladies bring luck," answered Ronicky, grinning. "I'm going to follow her
  orders every time I get a chance."</p>

  <p>And down he dropped into the hole.</p>

  <p>"Ever hear of such crazy work?" growled the father.</p>

  <p>But Jerry was becoming interested in the fate of her own suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Who'd put a box like that in a cellar!" exclaimed Hugh Dawn. "Who'd do
  that&mdash;put it right out in plain view!"</p>

  <p>"Plain view? Who suspected a cellar under a house like this until you put
  your foot through the floor?"</p>

  <p>Ronicky was lighting matches in the darkness below. Presently he called:
  "I see how come the veranda to be down to the ground level. All the stringers
  holding up the floor on this side are rotten and smashed over sidewise.
  And&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped.</p>

  <p>"We're beat," said Hugh Dawn, "before we get fairly started. I've come
  back and put my head into the mouth of the lion for nothing. That skunk
  Whitwell aimed to make a fool of me, that was all! Why should he of told me
  the truth, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"Because dying men don't lie!" shouted Ronicky Doone through the hole in
  the floor, and at the same time he cast up what looked like a great,
  rectangular chunk of rust. It fell with a crash onto the floor, the jar of
  the impact knocking off from its sides long flakes of the red dust, so that
  the metal looked forth from beneath.</p>

  <p>Ronicky vaulted up through the hole and stood exultant beside them.</p>

  <p>"He did put it under the veranda!" he cried. "He put it so far under that
  it rolled right on down into the cellar. And there it's laid ever since!"</p>

  <p>They stood about it in trembling excitement, Jerry so agape with
  astonishment that it was plain she had considered, up to this point, that the
  whole story was a myth. Hugh Dawn was beyond use of his muscles. Only Ronicky
  Doone had not been incapacitated by wonder and excitement.</p>

  <p>For unquestionably it was the "forty-pound box" so often referred to. Even
  Ronicky Doone was convinced. Of course there was no reason to think that the
  box proved anything, or that its discovery lead to important things. But as
  it stood there in the center of the three, a mass of red rust, its presence
  verified one step in the story of the Cosslett treasure, and thereby the
  whole trail seemed to be the truth. The rotting strong box was like a fourth
  presence. Its silence was more eloquent than a voice.</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap09"
     name="chap09">IX. THE IRON BOX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"It's heavy enough to have a tidy bunch of gold in it,"
said Ronicky.
  "Let's get her open. Did you bring a sledge hammer, Dawn?"</p>

  <p>The latter looked at him reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"Figure I'd come on a trip like this without getting a pack ready long
  before? Nope, Ronicky, I had my pack under my arm when I left the house on
  the run last night, and the things in the pack are a pick and a shovel and a
  chisel and an eight-pound sledge."</p>

  <p>As he enunciated the last word Ronicky disappeared through the door. Hugh
  Dawn picked up the strong box and, carrying it outside, had braced it firmly,
  lock up, between two big stones ready for the hammering which was to open it.
  Ronicky came a moment later with the hammer.</p>

  <p>"Now," Hugh cried, brandishing the hammer about his head, "look
  sharp!"</p>

  <p>He loosed a terrific blow which landed fairly and squarely upon the lock.
  But the hammer, after crunching through the rust, rebounded idly. The lock
  had not even been cracked. He whirled it again, again, and again. His back
  went up and down, and the sledge became a varying streak of light that struck
  against the box, always hitting accurately on one spot. Ronicky Doone looked
  on in amazement, and the girl's eyes shone in delight at the prowess of her
  father, when there was a slight sound of cracking; at another blow the box
  flew open.</p>

  <p>Inside there were exposed a few scraps of paper, and nothing else!</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone gasped with excitement. Was it true, then, that what the box
  was used for was to guard a secret and not money?</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn, panting with labor and joy, gathered the paper fragments in
  trembling fingers.</p>

  <p>"Read 'em, Jerry," he said. "I&mdash;my eyes are all blurred. Where's the
  map, first off?"</p>

  <p>There were three slips of paper, apparently fly leafs of books torn off,
  and the girl examined them.</p>

  <p>"There's no map," she said. "I'm sorry, dad."</p>

  <p>"No map!" he shouted. "Let me see! Let me see!"</p>

  <p>He snatched them from her, glaring; then he crumpled the paper into a ball
  and cast it to the ground.</p>

  <p>"No wonder Cosslett died with a smile," he groaned. "It was only a joke
  that he locked up in that box and threw away so careful. If ghosts walk the
  earth, he's somewhere in the air now laughing at me." He looked up as though
  he half expected to see the old face take form out of the empty
  atmosphere.</p>

  <p>"Nothing but a list of names and some figuring," the girl said with a
  sigh. "I'm afraid it was only a jest."</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone alone had not seen the writing. He ran a few steps after the
  ball of paper as it rolled along in the breeze, picked it up, and smoothed
  out the separate bits. What he found was exactly what had been reported.
  First there were two slips covered with a list of names and dates:</p>

  <p>H. L. L.&mdash;September 22. Gregory&mdash;May 9. Scottie&mdash; August
  14.</p>

  <p>The list continued, each separate name followed by dates ranging through
  two years until October of the second year. With this month the dates were
  crowded together. Half of the first slip and all of the second were covered
  with names and dates of that month. And last of all was the name "Hampden,
  October 19."</p>

  <p>It struck a faint light in Ronicky's groping imagination.</p>

  <p>"Hampden was the gent that run the affair for Cosslett, wasn't he?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"What of it?"</p>

  <p>"Here's his name the last of the lot."</p>

  <p>"And what does that mean?" Hugh Dawn asked.</p>

  <p>Jerry Dawn came and peered with interest over the shoulder of Ronicky.</p>

  <p>"It goes to prove that we're working on more than hearsay," the girl said.
  "Goes to prove that there was really a connection between Cosslett and
  Hampden, and in that case, why, Cosslett is simply a murderous old miser who
  used other men to do killings so that he could get gold, and who then sat
  down with his Bible and thought about his ill-gotten gains."</p>

  <p>"I knew all that before," declared her father. "But this is a blank trail,
  Jerry. Cosslett's gold will rest and rot. No man'll ever find it&mdash; all
  them millions!"</p>

  <p>Ronicky turned to the third slip. It was a compact jumble of figures. He
  read as follows:</p>

  <p>(1, 1, 3, 2; 1, 1, 6, 5; 1, 1, 9, 1; 1, 1, 12, 5) (2, 9, 1, 13; 2, 9, 1,
  4; 2, 9, 3, 6)</p>

  <p>So it ran on through line after line of bracketed numbers with commas and
  semicolons interspersed.</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone dropped the paper to his side. "Dawn," he said, "I figure
  that every word you've said is right, except where you begin to give up hope.
  But this mess of figures&mdash;I dunno what could have been in Cosslett's
  head when he started to make it up. Anyway, it can't do us any good."</p>

  <p>He was about to throw the papers to the wind, but the girl stayed his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Just a moment," she said hastily, and, taking the slip which contained
  the figures, she perused it carefully.</p>

  <p>Ronicky and her father anxiously turned toward her. Since both of them
  were convinced that the trail to the treasure began at the shack of Cosslett,
  and since there was no possible clue save that piece of paper and the list of
  numbers, they hoped against hope that Jerry could make something out of
  it.</p>

  <p>"If they's any sense to it," said her father, "Jerry'll get at it. She
  always was a wonder at puzzles, even when she was no bigger'n a minute."</p>

  <p>The girl raised her fine head, and now the gray eyes were glinting with
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"It's a message of some kind written in a code," she announced. There's no
  doubt about that."</p>

  <p>The two men crowded about her.</p>

  <p>"You see?" she pointed out. "There are thirteen of those bracketed groups.
  Inside the brackets the numbers are separated with commas and grouped with
  semicolons. I counted the groups set off by the semicolons, and altogether
  there are fifty-eight of them. Well, the average length of a word is about
  five letters. Five goes into fifty-eight eleven times and a little over.
  That's near enough. Fifty-eight letters to make up eleven words. And those
  eleven words &mdash;since they were locked up so carefully in the strong
  box&mdash;may they not form the directions to the place where the treasure is
  buried? I admit that I don't see how he could have written complete
  directions with so few words; but at least it gives us a new hope, doesn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>The cheer from the two men was answer enough.</p>

  <p>"After all," said Ronicky, "that leaves us almost as much in the dark as
  ever. See any way you can get at the code?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said the girl, shaking her head. "It looks hard. But then,
  most puzzles seem hard until you get at them, you know; and, once they're
  deciphered, they seem so simple that everyone is surprised he didn't see
  through the thing before. There are lots of ways of making up codes, of
  course. The oldest way is the worst. You simply substitute particular
  characters for the different letters. In that way you simply have a new
  alphabet."</p>

  <p>"That sounds hard enough to suit me," said her father, peering anxiously
  over her shoulder at the paper.</p>

  <p>"But, you see," explained Geraldine, "that there are ways of
  distinguishing letters by the frequency with which they are used. E is used
  much more than any other letter. Then come T, A, N, O, I, et cetera, in that
  same order. And&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where in the world," broke in Ronicky Doone, "did you learn all
  that?"</p>

  <p>"She's had a pile of schooling," replied the proud father.</p>

  <p>"Not schooling," Jerry Dawn said, with a laugh. "It's just that I've
  always been interested in puzzles, and I've picked up odds and ends of
  information that way. But to come back to this conundrum. It obviously isn't
  one of the simple types of codes. I'm certain that each group inside a
  semicolon represents a letter, and not one of the groups is identical with
  another. So the 'substituted alphabet' code isn't used at all. Outside of
  that code, there are scores of others, of course. Anyone can make up a code
  with a little forethought, and probably each code will be quite unlike, in
  several features, any other code in the world."</p>

  <p>"Then we're through," said her father bitterly. He wiped the perspiration
  from his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Please give me a chance to think," pleaded the girl, with a touch of
  irritation. "It isn't absolutely hopeless. At least there's room for work.
  For instance, inside of each bracket the first letter of each group is the
  same. And in each succeeding bracket the first letter is one larger. The
  characters of the first bracket run one, one, three, two; one, one, six,
  five; et cetera. In the second bracket they run two, nine, one, thirteen;
  two, nine, one, four, et cetera. And this continues right down to the last
  bracket, where the first character is thirteen."</p>

  <p>"But what on earth does that show?"</p>

  <p>"It shows an amateur maker of codes," said the girl firmly. "He could have
  left out the first character in every instance and found it simply by getting
  the number of the bracket in each case. Isn't that clear? But let's look at
  some other interesting features. The first character in each group is the
  same throughout the individual bracket. The second character is also
  identical throughout each bracket. In the first bracket the second character
  is everywhere one; in the second it is nine; in the third it is eighteen; in
  the fourth it is six. Each group is made up of four characters. The first two
  are regular throughout and follow some definite plan. The third character
  varies in the first two brackets only. In the first it is three, six, nine,
  twelve. In the second it is one, one, three. But after that the third
  character also becomes regular. In the third bracket it is always two, and in
  the fourth bracket it is always two; while in other brackets other numerals
  are used, but each is constant throughout the individual bracket. But the
  fourth character in each group is the variant. It changes continually."</p>

  <p>"It all sounds like Greek to me," said Ronicky.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it does," said the girl, "but that's simply because you haven't
  worked over things like this before. The regularity of the first three
  characters of the groups shows me that they are intended as guides. But the
  actual distinguishing element in each group is the last or fourth character.
  All of this, I admit, goes for nothing unless I get at some clue to the
  problem."</p>

  <p>"Maybe we can help," suggested Ronicky, "when it comes to clues."</p>

  <p>"They are of all kinds," said the girl, "these clues I refer to. They come
  out of the character and life of the man who makes the code, as a rule. This
  man, so far as I know, was a clever criminal. He also was fond of isolation
  and the Bible. Perhaps he thought he could read his way out of guilt and
  responsibility for his sins. At any rate, I'm going to think over what I know
  about him. The whole thing may clear up in a moment."</p>

  <p>And she walked away meditatingly tapping the Bible which had belonged to
  the dead Cosslett.</p>

  <p>"She's got book, ter, and verse," Ronicky Doone remarked, with a grin,
  "and, as long as she's that far along she'll find the words pretty soon."</p>

  <p>These words were hardly out of his mouth when the girl turned on him in a
  flash.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that seriously?" she cried eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," murmured Ronicky. "I was only joking, and if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she exclaimed, more to herself than to him.</p>

  <p>Then, to their astonishment, she pushed the paper into the hand of Ronicky
  and opened the Bible.</p>

  <p>"Read the first group!" she commanded.</p>

  <p>"One, one, three, two," said Ronicky obediently.</p>

  <p>"Book one. That's Genesis. Chapter one, third verse, second word&mdash;
  'God. ' Ronicky, perhaps we have it, but I mistrust that beginning. People
  don't begin codes with the word God. But no! What he'd used would be merely
  the first letter of the word. That must be it. The first letter is G.
  Next?"</p>

  <p>"One, one, six, five," read Ronicky dutifully, but his voice was uneven
  with his excitement.</p>

  <p>"Book one, ter one, sixth verse, fifth word!" translated Jerry Dawn. "And
  the word is 'there. ' Oh, Ronicky, we're lost! There isn't a word in the
  English language that begins with Gt. But go on."</p>

  <p>"One, one, nine, one. And don't give up. We're on the track of
  something!"</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn said nothing. He sat on a rock with his head buried in his
  hands, hardly able to endure the tension.</p>

  <p>"Ninth verse, first word, 'A. ' Gta. Ronicky, we're lost, indeed. That
  isn't the beginning of any word!"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," urged Ronicky, as she closed the book with a slam. "Count
  off the letters in the verses instead of the words. First book, first ter,
  third verse, second letter. What does that give you?"</p>

  <p>"N."</p>

  <p>"Now sixth verse and fifth letter."</p>

  <p>"O."</p>

  <p>"Ninth verse and first letter."</p>

  <p>"A."</p>

  <p>"Twelfth verse and fifth letter."</p>

  <p>"H. It spells N-O-A-H! Ronicky, we have it!"</p>

  <p>A groan of happiness came from Hugh Dawn, who rose and came stumbling to
  them. Steadily the spelling went on, Ronicky, scribbling down the letters as
  fast as the girl located them.</p>

  <p>In conclusion he read:</p>

  <p>Noah and the crescent in line with ravenhead and the vixen twenty
  down.</p>

  <p>"Noah and the crescent in line with ravenhead and the vixen twenty down,"
  repeated Hugh Dawn sourly. "And what the devil good does all the work do when
  it only brings us to this? Noah and the crescent&mdash;twenty down!"</p>

  <p>He groaned again.</p>

  <p>"Just a minute more," said his daughter, more eagerly than ever. "Doesn't
  it strike you that those words are like names of places? Noah may be the name
  of a town. Then The Crescent, ' and 'Ravenhead, ' and The Vixen. '"</p>

  <p>"But what good do four jumbled names do us," asked the father.</p>

  <p>"I have it!" cried Ronicky. "It's sure plain now that it's down in black
  and white. 'Get Noah and The Crescent in line, and then get The Vixen and
  Ravenhead in line. And at the point where the lines cross, dig down twenty
  feet!"</p>

  <p>Both father and daughter shouted as the whole riddle became clear.</p>

  <p>"Heaven bless that iron box!" cried Hugh Dawn.</p>

  <p>"And the hammer that busted it!" Ronicky supplemented.</p>

  <p>"We're rich," went on Hugh Dawn. "The money's as good as ours. We can
  start planning how to spend twenty millions. Don't I know the old Ravenhead
  Mountain? And don't I know The Crescent? And maybe they's a couple of smaller
  mountains around them parts that are called The Vixen and Mount Noah. I
  dunno. But well start right now for old Ravenhead Mountain!"</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">X. DISASTER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In that determination, however, he was ruled down by
Ronicky and Jerry
  Dawn. For now the twilight was deepening, and the way toward Ravenhead, over
  rough trails and twenty miles away, according to Dawn's recollection, would
  make bitter work in the darkness. It was determined, therefore, to wait until
  the morning. With the first gray of dawn they would start, and by that light
  they should easily manage to get over the trail to Ravenhead by
  midmorning.</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone estimated the time at their disposal.</p>

  <p>"We ought," he said, "to have the stuff located by tomorrow night, and
  while we're working Jerry can ride over the hills and get a wagon and a team
  of hosses from the nearest town. We'll load and start straight back, and when
  we get near civilization we can hire enough gents to hold off Moon and his
  three."</p>

  <p>"His three?" Hugh Dawn groaned. "His thirty, more like! He's got 'em
  scattered through the country, son, and he has ways of getting in touch with
  'em pronto. If he got excited about this trail, he might have the whole crowd
  out combing the country for me inside of twenty-four hours. Still, I think we
  got time. He'll spend most of today hunting by himself. Tonight he'll send
  out his call. Tomorrow they'll spend getting together. And day after tomorrow
  in the morning he'll be ready to send out his search parties. I've seen him
  work that way before. But when he sends 'em out, well already be snaking
  south for the railroad, hit it, and slide off east! Ronicky, for the first
  time in his life Moon is going to be beat! Not a chance in a million that
  he'll ever connect me up with the old Cosslett treasure. Not a chance that
  he'll think I'm hunting for it. He'll figure me to be lying out in the hills
  waiting for a few days. And he'll comb the country around Trainor before he
  steps out farther."</p>

  <p>The matter was allowed to rest there. Before the shack of Cosslett they
  built a fire of the wood which had been torn from the little veranda floor,
  and there they cooked their evening meal.</p>

  <p>It was dark before they had ended. Afterward they went inside the shack.
  It was possible to clear the bunk and prop up its broken side after removing
  the fallen rafter. That made a comfortable bed for the girl. As for Ronicky
  and Hugh Dawn, they would sleep on the floor.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, after putting down their blankets, Ronicky declared his
  intention of taking a ride on Lou by way of a nightcap. For he declared that
  he could not possibly sleep so soon after their rest of the midday. Father
  and daughter had too much to talk over to object strenuously. And a moment
  later he left the cabin. They heard his mare whinny a greeting to him, and
  then the roll of her gallop passed down the hill and out of hearing. Hugh
  Dawn listened to the disappearing sound, his head cocked upon one side.</p>

  <p>"There," he said, "goes a queer one!"</p>

  <p>"Queer?" echoed Jerry, with a distinct lack of enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"That's what I said. Never saw the like of him yet, and I've seen a pile
  of men, rough and smooth and all kinds."</p>

  <p>"Of all the kinds I've known," said his daughter hotly, "he's the the
  finest, the bravest, the most generous."</p>

  <p>"Sure, sure! He's all of that and more. I'm not holding it against him.
  But he's a wild one, if ever I saw a man!"</p>

  <p>"Wild?"</p>

  <p>"What d'you call it when a fellow hears news about somebody he's never
  heard mentioned before, and then rides twenty miles and takes his life in his
  hands to give a warning?"</p>

  <p>"You haven't told me yet&mdash;so many things have been happening
  &mdash;how you came to catch him in the hall of the house."</p>

  <p>"I was at the window in the hall. I saw Ronicky climb up the side of the
  house, but the distance and the dark made it a hard job to shoot from where I
  was, even though I was sure that he was one of Moon's men come for me. I
  sneaked around into the place in front of the stairs where they turn into the
  hall on the second floor, and when he came down I flashed the electric torch
  at him and shot. How I missed, I don't know. But he changed into a wild cat
  the minute the light hit him. He jumped here and there like a flash, and
  before I could land him he swung on me and knocked me out. Where he got the
  muscle to do it out of those skinny arms of his, beats me; but it ain't the
  only thing about him that beats me. Look at the way he talks to his hoss like
  she was human. Look at the way he goes off riding alone by night!"</p>

  <p>"I can understand everything you mention," replied his daughter.</p>

  <p>"Sure you can," and Hugh Dawn grinned. "That's because he's smiled at you
  a couple of times today."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to infer&mdash;" began Jerry.</p>

  <p>"Don't be proud," chuckled her father.</p>

  <p>"I never heard of anything so absurd," said Jerry indignantly. "Why, I
  &mdash;I don't know the man! He's a stranger!"</p>

  <p>"Sure. That's why you're blushing like this. You are your mother all over
  again, my dear, and she was always forming quick likes and dislikes. Heaven
  bless her! But me, I take more time to think things and folks over. You'll
  find out that it pays, Jerry, in the long run."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what all the talk's about," said the girl a trifle uneasily.
  "If you think that I've been forward with Mr. Doone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There you go!" Her father laughed as he spoke. "I will ask you to stop
  climbing mountains, and you jump over a cliff instead. I don't mean nothing,
  except for you to watch your ways with Ronicky. You ain't an ordinary girl,
  Jerry, dear. You got more looks than most. Not that you're the most beautiful
  I ever seen, but you got a downright pleasing way, and when you smile your
  whole face lights up a lot."</p>

  <p>"Of course all this is absurd," said Jerry. "But if I choose to be
  courteous to a man who saved your life&mdash;both our lives, perhaps&mdash;
  is there anything wrong in it?"</p>

  <p>"Courtesy is one thing; it ain't what I'm talking about," said her father
  gravely.</p>

  <p>"And the other thing?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Jerry, I'd a pile rather see you dead than get seriously interested
  in a gent like Ronicky Doone."</p>

  <p>She stared at him, almost frightened.</p>

  <p>"I see," said he, very grave, "that you've been thinking even more than I
  suspected."</p>

  <p>"Dad," she cried, "this is insufferable. Oblique expressions like these
  only serve to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tie them big words up, brand 'em, and keep 'em for the fancy markets,"
  said her father gruffly. "I don't foller 'em easy. Talk plain. I'm a plain
  man. And I tell you plainly that I love you too much to see you throw away
  time on one like Doone. For why? Because he's a will-o'-the-wisp, my dear.
  He's one of these gents who go through life without ever settling down to one
  thing. He's about what? Twenty-five, I'd take him to be. Well, Jerry, he's
  crammed ten times more fighting inside his twenty-five years than I've put
  inside forty- five. A fighting man is like a fighting wolf&mdash;they'd
  better hunt alone!"</p>

  <p>"You don't mean," she said, "that he's a gun fighter!"</p>

  <p>"Don't I? Well, honey, you got to learn to use your eyes! What does it
  mean when a gent carries his holster slung away down low on his right hip
  so's it's just within twitching distance of his finger tips? Ain't that to
  have it ready for a fast draw? And what does it mean when a gent's left hand
  is all pale from being in a glove, and when his right hand is brown as a
  berry?"</p>

  <p>"Because the left hand is the bridle hand."</p>

  <p>"Because the right hand is the gun hand, Jerry!"</p>

  <p>She winced at his surety.</p>

  <p>"I'm as sure of it," said her father, blowing a great cloud of smoke from
  his pipe, "as I am that my name is Hugh Dawn. And watch his hands. Long and
  slender and nervous. No flesh on 'em. He's never made a living by work. No
  calluses on those hands. Nothing to keep them from being fast as a flash of
  light&mdash;like the hands of a musician, they look to me. Always doing
  something with that right hand of his. His left hand is used to hanging
  steady on the reins, and it's always lying still. But his right hand ain't
  never still. It's always jumping about and rapping on something, or going
  here and there and everywhere just for the sake of being under way. I'll tell
  you why: Because that's the right hand that's saved the life of Ronicky Doone
  more'n once! It's the hand that's got his trigger finger! It's his
  fortune!"</p>

  <p>"You mean," breathed the girl, "that he's a professional gunman&mdash;a
  murderer?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit! He wouldn't take advantage of his skill with a gun&mdash; not
  to hurt anybody. But I'll wager he's got his man before now. I'll wager that
  before he dies he'll get a pile more. It's wrote in big letters all over
  him."</p>

  <p>"He'll change," said Jerry Dawn feverishly. "I know that he'll
  change!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe you could do the changing?" said her father.</p>

  <p>Her flush was at least a partial admission that she had had the
  thought.</p>

  <p>"Some girls," said he, "are so plumb good that they marry a man for the
  sake of being close to him and reforming him. Sometimes they do. Ronicky
  Doone is a fine gent. Brave, honest as the day's long, generous. But he ain't
  meant for a girl to love. I'm putting it strong. I don't mean that you feel
  anything like that for him yet. I'm just warning you. Because if you just
  give a gent like that a kind look, you may set him on fire; he starts making
  love like a fire in a storm; first thing you know, you're engaged. And that's
  the end. Jerry, you'll watch out?"</p>

  <p>As he leaned earnestly toward her he saw her face whiten, saw her eyes
  widen. There was a ghost-seeing look about her, and instantly Hugh Dawn knew
  that a horror was standing in the door of the cabin. Instinctively he
  measured the distance to his gun. Like a fool he had hung it with his belt on
  a nail against the wall. It was hopelessly out of arm's length.</p>

  <p>He turned his head with a convulsive jerk, and there in the door he saw
  Jack Moon.</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">XI. THE TRAP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was no gun in his hand, and yet the man radiated
danger. His silent
  coming, the very smile with which he looked down on them, were filled with
  terror-inspiring qualities. As for Hugh Dawn, he uttered a faint groan and
  then whirled out of his chair and stood upon his widely braced feet. Even
  when Dawn reeled back within reaching distance of his gun on the wall and
  made a motion toward it, the tall man in the door did not offer to draw his
  own weapon, but the smile hardened a little on his mouth, and his eyes grew
  fixed.</p>

  <p>Jerry knew that it was Jack Moon. She had never seen his face, never even
  heard it accurately described; but somehow she knew that the man there in the
  doorway was the root of all evil.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she leaped from the bunk and cast herself before her father. That
  sudden motion had brought the revolver into the hand of Moon, but it was
  instantly restored to its holster. The double movement had been merely a
  flash of light. Such speed of hand was uncanny.</p>

  <p>"Steady," said the outlaw. "No cause for jumping in front of the sneak,
  lady. I ain't going to shoot him right away. Not right away. Maybe never. All
  depends on how him and me come to agree. Or maybe well agree to disagree.
  Just you sit down yonder where you were, miss. No harm'll come to you." He
  removed his hat and bowed to her, and in so doing he half turned his back on
  her father.</p>

  <p>She knew that the devilish brain of the man had inspired this maneuver to
  tempt her father into action. But Hugh Dawn was in no condition to fight. His
  will was paralyzed. He could not fight any more than the bird can escape from
  the hypnotic eye of the snake.</p>

  <p>"They tell hard tales about Jack Moon," went on the big man, thus
  announcing himself, "but they never yet whispered a story about him laying a
  finger on a woman, young or old. I can tell you to lay to it that you're as
  safe with me as if you was a six-months-old baby in the arms of your mother.
  It ain't you I aim to talk to&mdash;it's that!"</p>

  <p>He indicated her father with a jerk of his thumb. But for some reason his
  contempt did not degrade Hugh Dawn. The man would fight willingly enough
  against odds which were at all even. But he recognized the madness of a
  bulldog attacking a lion. Even as great as this was the contrast, it was not
  that Moon was so much larger in physical dimensions. But he was made bigger
  by an inward lordliness that overflowed. The poise of his head was that of a
  conqueror. His spirit towered above her father like the young Achilles over
  some nameless Trojan warrior.</p>

  <p>"I seen the box outside," said Jack Moon. "What was in it, Dawn?"</p>

  <p>There was no resistance in Dawn. He pointed sullenly to the slip of paper
  lying on the bed&mdash;the paper on which had been written the directions for
  reaching the site of the treasure.</p>

  <p>The bandit strode across the room and reached for it, but the girl, with a
  lightning movement, forestalled him. She swept it up, leaped away from Moon,
  who followed with a startled exclamation, and, balling the paper to a hard
  knot as she ran, she reached the window above the lake and threw the paper as
  far as her strength allowed. The wind was blowing in that direction, and the
  precious slip would be wafted down to the waters of the lake.</p>

  <p>The hand of Jack Moon was checked in the very act of falling on her
  shoulder and turning her around. But when she faced him, white and drawn
  about the lips, he was smiling again.</p>

  <p>"That took nerve," he said, "seeing the reputation I got around these
  parts. But I got to tell you this, lady. It don't do even for ladies to fool
  with Jack Moon. I don't handle 'em the way I handle men, but most generally I
  find ways of makin' 'em behave. Now"&mdash;and here he turned on Hugh
  Dawn&mdash;"tell me what was on that paper!"</p>

  <p>"No, no," shouted the girl. "Don't you see, dad, that it's the price of
  your own head?"</p>

  <p>"There you are again," said Jack Moon sternly, seeing that the exclamation
  had sealed the lips of Dawn as the latter was about to speak. "You'll have to
  learn better than that, lady, before you're with me long. Dawn, will you open
  up and tell me?"</p>

  <p>The gun gleamed in his hand. He thrust it against the breast of Dawn.</p>

  <p>"Now talk quick," he muttered. "I know everything, Dawn. Treat heard you
  and Whitwell, but I want to get the yarn out of your own mouth. I'll tell you
  this, Dawn: if you open up, maybe they'll be a way out for you!"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk, don't talk!" cried Jerry Dawn. "Don't trust him, dad!"</p>

  <p>"If you care for your rotten soul," said Jack Moon, "come out with it,
  Dawn!"</p>

  <p>The latter groaned: "What price d'you pay, Moon?"</p>

  <p>"Price? What sort of a price d'you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Freedom," said Dawn. "And your word on it."</p>

  <p>"Would you trust him?" moaned Jerry.</p>

  <p>"Be quiet, Jerry," said her father. "No matter what else Moon is, he's a
  man of his word. It's never been broke yet."</p>

  <p>"But it's seldom given," replied Moon coolly. "Why should I give it to you
  now?"</p>

  <p>"How high," retorted Dawn, "d'you put the price on my life?"</p>

  <p>"Prices? I dunno. Prices change. I've known gents I'd shoot as soon as I'd
  kill a dog. I've known some that would have to pay thousands to buy
  themselves off. But for a gent that's double crossed me the way you've done
  &mdash;well, it'd have to be high!"</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn nodded.</p>

  <p>"How high?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Everything you got," said the outlaw, "would be enough."</p>

  <p>To the astonishment of the girl, her father shook his head, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"You can make your choice," said Moon. "Either you turn over the whole
  Cosslett stuff to me or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I haven't got the Cosslett money. You know that!"</p>

  <p>"You've got the plan to show where it is."</p>

  <p>"Suppose the plan turns out wrong?"</p>

  <p>The admission implied in this question made the eyes of Jack Moon
  blaze.</p>

  <p>"By the gods," he whispered, "you did get it!"</p>

  <p>"You lied to me, then," growled Dawn. "Treat didn't hear Whitwell talk
  about the box and what he thought was in it!"</p>

  <p>"Treat didn't hear anything. But now that I know you've got the plan
  inside your head, come out with it, Dawn, and you and me will make a dicker.
  Wait! Here's something that the rest of the boys have got to vote on. You can
  thank your stars that I've got the majority of the crew with me!"</p>

  <p>He whistled, a shrill, fluting sound long prolonged, and there was a
  rushing of horses' hoofs up the slope to the crest of the hill. Presently the
  door and the windows were packed with ominous faces, and there was everywhere
  the glittering of drawn guns. Nearly a dozen men had gathered around the
  little ruined shanty in the space of a few seconds. Well indeed had it been
  for Hugh Dawn that he had not attacked the leader when the latter was
  seemingly alone.</p>

  <p>"Boys," said Jack Moon to the dark faces which waited silently, all turned
  toward Dawn and his daughter, "I've run him down, but it seems that he can
  offer a price. I want to know what figure you'd put on his head?"</p>

  <p>"Whitwell was my pal," said a voice sternly. "What price was he given a
  chance to pay? I say shoot the skunk and have it done with."</p>

  <p>Another voice growled: "What price was Gandil given a chance to pay?
  Wasn't he a better man than Dawn ever dreamed of being? I say shoot the
  skunk!"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, boys," said the leader, raising his hand. "You got as good
  a right to vote on this as I have. And you're going to have your way. You
  know I always see to that. But first I want you to know the whole facts. The
  price that Dawn can pay is the whole Cosslett treasure."</p>

  <p>That astonishing news brought a gasp from every member of the band.
  Evidently Moon had talked about that accumulation of wealth enough to have
  filled the fancies of his wild followers.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure of that?" asked a number of voices.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure he's got the plan."</p>

  <p>"And if we don't find the stuff?"</p>

  <p>"Then Dawn dies. That's easy, ain't it? We give him our word that if we
  get the gold, he goes scot-free. If we don't get it, he dies. Are you with
  me, boys?"</p>

  <p>"How much," said another voice, "d'you figure that gold would come
  to?"</p>

  <p>"Five millions at least, and maybe anything up to twenty. Hard to believe
  all the yarns they told about that gold. Sometimes they got so excited they
  multiplied everything by four. Sometimes they got so careless about gold, and
  so used to it, that they understated things. I dunno how the Cosslett
  treasure stands, but I figure on five millions as the least we'd get. Think
  it over, boys! You and me! altogether, make fourteen. Add three more shares
  for me, which is only my right, and that makes seventeen. Seventeen into five
  million &mdash;how much does that make? Close to three hundred thousand
  dollars apiece, lads. Close to three hundred thousand! Put that out at seven
  per cent. That gives you twenty thousand a year. Think it over! That's the
  price that Hugh Dawn can offer for his life. The biggest haul that was ever
  made in the mountains. Twenty thousand dollars to every one of you every year
  of your lives. Is it worth his life to you, boys?"</p>

  <p>There was a moment of bewildered silence, and then a mutter of
  astonishment. Those eyes were calculating, spending, already.</p>

  <p>"Cut all that down by one third," said Hugh Dawn suddenly. "I've just
  thought of something."</p>

  <p>Moon turned on him with a snarl of anger.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to bargain with me about it?" he asked. "Ain't you
  satisfied with having your ratty life?"</p>

  <p>For the first time Hugh Dawn did not shrink. He met the eye of Jack Moon
  steadily.</p>

  <p>"Tell you how it is," he said. "I can buy you off with my share of the
  stuff, and Jerry's share. But she and me ain't the only ones. They's another
  gent that has to be figured in. 'Twasn't for him we'd never be here. It was
  him that warned me you was coming, him that got us safely up here, and him
  that helped us work out the puzzle. Moon, you got nothin' agin' him, and he's
  got to come in for a third of everything you get! Understand?"</p>

  <p>The girl was amazed. Her heart had been sinking, her blood growing cold,
  in the feeling that her father had from first to last in this encounter
  played the part of a coward. This sudden defiance of Jack Moon bewildered
  her. Then she began to make out the reasons for it. It was not the actual
  danger that terrified her father; he was simply paralyzed by the name and the
  presence of Moon. The outlaw was as amazed as any one could have been by this
  resistance, and by the revelation of these secrets.</p>

  <p>"The gent that warned you?" he echoed. "Warned you I was coming?"</p>

  <p>"He heard everything. He was in the barn. He rode around you and got to me
  and fought his way into the house to tell me you was coming."</p>

  <p>"I got a lot to thank this gent for," said the leader calmly. "Him and me
  ought to be able to come to an understanding. What's his name?"</p>

  <p>"Ronicky Doone, he called himself. And he's sure a square shooter."</p>

  <p>"Ronicky Doone?" echoed the outlaw. "Well, I'll pass the word to the boys
  that if a gent shows up pretty soon, they're not to take a pot shot at him.
  They got a habit of using up ammunition plumb careless that way. Si!"</p>

  <p>Treat strode through the door.</p>

  <p>"You remember how Dawn plugged you through the leg? Now you stay here and
  watch him, Si, and see he don't get loose from you. Understand?"</p>

  <p>The teeth of Treat showed through the tangles of his black beard and
  mustache. Calmly he drew his revolver and sat down with the weapon balanced
  on his knee and pointing toward Hugh Dawn.</p>

  <p>The leader left the shack and with a gesture gathered half a dozen of his
  men around him.</p>

  <p>"Baldy, you take charge. Take these gents along with you. Post 'em
  scattering out along the hillside so's to cover every direction. You heard
  the name of the gent that's up here along with Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"Nope."</p>

  <p>"Ronicky Doone! Ever hear of him?"</p>

  <p>"Seems like I have, sort of in patches, somewhere."</p>

  <p>"If you'd ever been down South you'd of heard a pile more than patches
  about him. He's the most nacheral gun fighter that ever drilled a gent full
  of lead. Baldy, go out on the hill and watch. Don't shoot till you get him
  close. And then don't ask no questions. Just blaze away. I'm going back
  inside and tell 'em that I've arranged for a nice quiet reception for Doone.
  When you've dropped him, I'll go busting out and raise the devil, like I'd
  give you strict orders not to do any shooting. Understand?"</p>

  <p>Baldy whispered an assent.</p>

  <p>"If you want to have something to give you a grudge agin' him, I can tell
  you that this is the gent that overheard us in the barn, and that rode ahead
  and warned Dawn we were coming. Now scatter out yonder, and mind you shoot
  low."</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">XII. BARGAIN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"We'll go on with the dicker," explained Jack Moon,
returning to the
  cabin, "as soon as this Doone comes along. We'll settle down all nice and
  peaceable and get to an agreement like friends. Which there ain't any reason
  why we shouldn't be friends, Dawn; and so far as you're concerned, I don't
  see no reason why I couldn't fix you up with one of my shares of the stuff
  before we're through."</p>

  <p>Jerry studied the man with the most intense curiosity. Certainly he was a
  person of varying moods. Now, when he talked again, she noted that he paid
  more and more attention to her and less and less to her father, as though he
  recognized in her a force which had to be reckoned with. According to his
  explanation, everything would work out smoothly. As soon as Ronicky Doone
  approached, they would sit down and come to an understanding. He had already
  sent out his men, he said, to watch for the coming of Doone, and he would be
  brought in to share the discussion on equal terms. It might be difficult to
  induce his men, he said, to consent to so large a share as one third going to
  Doone. But no doubt they could compromise handsomely, and every one would be
  satisfied.</p>

  <p>Yet, while he talked, she branded every one of his words as a lie. Not
  that she hated him. There was a mixture of respect with the fear with which
  she regarded him, and where respect enters in, there is never a complete
  detestation. But it was respect for his cool prowess rather than for his
  moral qualities. What gave her the chief doubt was that he, having so
  manifestly the upper hand, should be so carefully considerate of others as he
  was pretending to be of Dawn, herself, and the absent Ronicky Doone. How
  greatly would the whole problem of the division be simplified, for instance,
  if a bullet should strike down Ronicky Doone!</p>

  <p>No sooner had the idea occurred to her than she was reasonably sure that
  it had occurred to the bandit also, and she began to strain her ear painfully
  for the first sound of the sand and gravel under the hoofs of the approaching
  Lou. In the meantime, Hugh Dawn had recovered his mental poise to a large
  degree, and when the leader spoke to him, he was able to answer calmly. He
  even entered into some details of his experiences in the East since he left
  Trainor, and told of the hard work which had enabled him to make enough money
  to support his girl from the distance and send her to school.</p>

  <p>"But what beats me," said Jack Moon, "is that you didn't send for her. Why
  not, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"Because," said the other quietly, "I knew pretty well that you were
  watching her close all the time, and that the minute she made a move out of
  the country you'd follow her on the chance that she might be trying to get to
  see me. If I sent for her, I'd be doing the same thing as sending for
  you."</p>

  <p>Jack Moon shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You see," he complained to the girl, "they's some folks that never get
  over being suspicious. Follow a girl trying to get back to her father? I
  leave it to you, Miss Dawn, if I look to be that sort of a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here she lost track of his words, because far off she heard the hoofs of a
  horse crunching into the gravel at the bottom of the hill on which Cosslett's
  shack stood. The horse came at a steady and swinging gallop. The picture of
  Ronicky Doone on the lively mare rushed into her mind. Suddenly she started
  to her feet and shouted: "Ronicky! Danger!"</p>

  <p>Far away through the night thrilled her voice. Before an echo could pick
  it up, there was the crash of half a dozen firearms. Then came the rushing of
  the galloping horse withdrawing, and last of all a far-flung yell of
  defiance. Ronicky Doone had escaped.</p>

  <p>The girl turned from the window.</p>

  <p>"Is this the square deal you'd planned for Ronicky Doone?" she asked
  fiercely. "Is this what you did? Ah, I read your mind all the while."</p>

  <p>The bandit was shaking his head as though bewildered.</p>

  <p>"How come all this, I dunno. Maybe when Doone heard you yell he fired, and
  my boys answered him. That's human nature, and you can't blame them for doing
  it, I guess. Eh?</p>

  <p>She smiled scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Treat!" called the leader.</p>

  <p>When the black-bearded man entered, Jack Moon left the cabin hastily.
  "I'll make out if the fools have done any harm to him," he called back to
  Jerry Dawn.</p>

  <p>Once outside, however, he broke into a run, cursing under his breath, and
  so came to the group of Baldy's men making slowly back toward the cabin. Jack
  Moon plunged through their midst until he came to his lieutenant, whose
  shoulder he gripped with fingers of iron.</p>

  <p>"Curse you for a fool!" he said bitterly. "I told you to hold your fire
  till you were sure of him!"</p>

  <p>"Then why didn't you keep that she-devil from screeching? He was about in
  point-blank range. I was all ready to give the signal, and then she yelled,
  and he turned."</p>

  <p>"Did you drill him at all?"</p>

  <p>"What chance did I have in this light? Even the stars are dim. And he
  started his hoss swerving. No more chance of dropping him than there was of
  killing a cloud shadow. He was gone, and that was all there was to it."</p>

  <p>Jack Moon cursed again, and without further speech he turned on his heel
  and strode back for the cabin.</p>

  <p>But he was smiling again when he got to the place.</p>

  <p>"Just as I figured," he said. "When you yelled you scared Doone into
  pulling his gun and shooting at the first shadow he saw, and my boys figured
  he was shooting at them, so they gave him a volley. That was all they was to
  it. But he got off without being hurt." He went on soberly: "But this messes
  things up. Most likely this Ronicky Doone will send back for help to get you
  folks free. That being the case, we got not a ghost of a chance to get to the
  treasure. He knows the secret, and he'll lead all the men he can raise
  straight to the spot and keep me off; and that, Dawn, makes it pretty hard on
  you, I'd say&mdash;pretty hard!"</p>

  <p>His eyes bored cruelly into the eyes of his intended victim.</p>

  <p>"There goes your price that you was going to pay," he continued. "There it
  goes up in smoke. Before morning Doone will have fifty men headed for the
  place!"</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn raised a hand.</p>

  <p>"Gimme one minute alone with you," he urged.</p>

  <p>The leader assented, and Dawn stepped out of the door and into the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>"You don't need to have no fear of Doone," he said, as soon as they were
  safely out of earshot of the girl. "He knows that I ain't much more of a
  friend to the law than you are. He knows that I can't have a sheriff asking
  me questions. He knows, besides, that I was a member of your crowd once."</p>

  <p>"You think, for your sake, he'll let five million dollars go?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think. I know," replied the other. "That's the kind of a gent he
  is. Not ordinary by no means, Moon."</p>

  <p>"What d'you figure on doing now? What am I to do? Take a chance that this
  man-killing Doone, that I've heard about, won't call in a crowd to clean up
  on me? From what I've heard about him, Dawn, he'd rather find a fight than a
  million, and when he gets a chance for fighting and money at the same time,
  why, he'll just start and run amuck. I'm talking to you straight, son,
  because I dunno how to figure. You know him, and I don't."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you this," said Hugh Dawn, knowing that in spite of the quiet
  of Moon, the subject up for discussion was whether or not he, Dawn, should be
  killed and left or whether the outlaw should bargain his life against his
  secret. "I'll tell you this: Ronicky Doone won't make a move to get help,
  because he knows that the minute he shows up with a crowd behind him, the
  first thing you'll do will be to plug me."</p>

  <p>"Is he as fond of you as all that?"</p>

  <p>"Moon, this gent Doone is a killer. I guess you know that already, but if
  you don't know it, I'll tell you. But besides being a killer, he's as square
  a shooter as ever I seen! He shook hands to go through this game with me, and
  he'll go through thinking just as much of my skin as if it was his own. You
  can lay to that positive. I know!"</p>

  <p>There was something entirely convincing about his manner of speaking. And
  indeed he was one of the few men in the world whom Moon was willing to
  believe, at least in part. He stood somewhat in awe of the honesty of Hugh
  Dawn. This was the only man that had ever come into his clutches and escaped
  unstained by grim crimes. There was not another man in his band at the
  present moment that had not committed at least one murder or participated in
  a killing. Dawn alone had withdrawn from the horrible necessity of obeying
  the leader, even though he knew that that withdrawal drew down the vengeance
  of the band on his head.</p>

  <p>"Hugh," he said at last. "I'm going to take the chance. The stake's large
  enough to make it worth while. Tell me the secret you learned out of the box,
  and I'll give you my word and my hand, before we take another step, that no
  harm shall come to you from me. Will you do that?"</p>

  <p>"And Doone?" insisted Hugh Dawn stubbornly.</p>

  <p>"Doone's share? The best I can promise is that I'll get the boys to vote
  him as much as I can. Will that do?"</p>

  <p>"It'll have to," admitted Hugh Dawn. "And here's my hand,
Jack."</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">XIII. TRAILING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The whisper of bullets about his head, as he whirled his
mare down the
  slope of the hill, had given Ronicky Doone a veritable volume of
  explanations. The number of the guns and the girl's shrill cry of warning to
  which he owed his safety, were ample testimony that Jack Moon and his band
  had reached the cabin and captured the rather and daughter.</p>

  <p>But had they spared the girl and killed the man, as it seemed that their
  most logical course of action would dictate? That problem filled the mind of
  Ronicky as he scurried away to the safety of the trees and the darkness. And
  it stayed with him during the long vigil of the night.</p>

  <p>If Hugh Dawn were dead, then the great necessity was to gather other men
  at once and free the girl from Moon's band. But if there had been a chance
  for talk, it stood to reason that they could bargain with Moon, the treasure
  against their lives. If he rashly brought on a posse to free the prisoners,
  it also stood to reason that Moon would kill Hugh Dawn before he fled from
  the power of the law.</p>

  <p>He reviewed the case, in fact, exactly as Hugh Dawn had prophesied he
  would. The best conclusion to which he could come was that he had better
  linger on the outskirts on the march of the outlaws and do them what damage
  he could until he had reduced their numbers, or until he found an opportunity
  of making a dash to win the freedom of the girl and her father in case both
  were alive. What he chiefly worried about was the man, for he knew Westerners
  and their ways well enough to understand that a girl need have no fear, so
  long as she was in their midst. The most they would do would be to keep the
  pair for some time in their company until they had reached a far portion of
  the mountains, and then they would send her back. But even on the point of
  their treatment of the girl he could not be sure, for his memory of the pale,
  handsome face of Jack Moon brought up the most evil forebodings. The man must
  be capable of any crime.</p>

  <p>With these thoughts to disturb him, Ronicky passed a miserable night, and
  in the first gray of the dawn he made out, from the shack on the hill beside
  Cunningham Lake, the signs of preparations for breakfast.</p>

  <p>His own meal consisted of hard-tack, while Lou grazed in a meadow of rich
  grass which he had found behind the outskirts of the trees.</p>

  <p>The meal on the cliff was followed by saddling and mounting, and now
  Ronicky strained his eyes from the covert of the trees as he had never
  strained them before.</p>

  <p>He could not distinguish faces. But he made out the form of the girl on
  her gray horse, placed about halfway down the long procession, and beside her
  rode another figure on another gray horse. It must be her father.</p>

  <p>He waited, however, until the whole cavalcade had moved on. There were now
  fourteen men besides the girl and her father; evidently the whole Moon band
  had assembled at the Cosslett cabin during the night. The thirteen were led
  by one so formidable as lack Moon. It was indeed a Herculean task even to
  dream of thwarting so many practiced fighters. And yet the eyes of Ronicky
  Doone gleamed with evil desire, and he caressed the butt of his rifle. Rapid
  fire might greatly reduce that company, but at the first shot he knew another
  bullet would be driven into the body of Hugh Dawn.</p>

  <p>He dismissed all shadow of doubt as to whether or not Hugh Dawn lived by
  climbing into the saddle on Lou and riding to the cabin. There he made a
  careful search for crimson stains, and, finding none, he was certain that
  there had been no death in Cosslett's shack.</p>

  <p>It needed a long detour to the left to come in sight of the riders again.
  He picked them up in the midst of a difficult trail, almost blind, that ran
  among the mountains north and west. The direction made the heart of Ronicky
  leap, for it convinced him that Jack Moon had at length learned the secret of
  the treasure. The bargain had indeed been made!</p>

  <p>After that Ronicky hung less closely on the heels of the riders. It was a
  needless courting of danger, and if the distance to the burial place were
  twenty miles, as Dawn had estimated, he need not dog their footsteps every
  inch of the way.</p>

  <p>He contented himself with coming into view only occasionally, weaving from
  one side of the trail to the other so that, in case he had been seen and a
  small rear party were detached to take him, he would not be located in the
  expected place. But always, when he had a chance to count the numbers of the
  procession, the original fifteen came to view.</p>

  <p>It was mid-morning when they debouched out of the upper mountains into a
  steep-sided hollow. To the southeast a narrow, deep ravine carried out into
  the distance the waters of a little creek which flashed with arrowy swiftness
  from among the pines of the northern slope. Wood, water, a shelter from the
  winds &mdash;what more could man wish for in a camping ground? The existence
  of the trail across the mountains was readily explained by the pitted sides
  of the hollow. There had been mines here, many a year before, and the trail
  had been worn by the hundreds of pack mules and horses; rocks had been
  cleared away here, trees hewn down there.</p>

  <p>Ronicky was in time to see the procession turn into a mad rush for the
  bottom of the hollow as soon as the crest was topped. Helter-skelter down the
  side they rushed, and in the bottom land below he saw them dancing like mad
  creatures as they flung themselves from their horses. Only the two figures on
  the grays retained their saddles. The rest seemed to be intoxicated, and no
  doubt this was the gold-madness taking hold of them.</p>

  <p>After the first frenzy they were seen to be swirling around a central,
  commanding figure seated on a bay horse of unusual size, and Ronicky did not
  need a field glass to pick the man out as Jack Moon. For this was the
  directing mind which presently sent men scrambling here and there. He himself
  joined the workers, and after a time Ronicky could make out that they were
  lining up two tall mountains to the north and crossing this line with another
  drawn through two other peaks in the east.</p>

  <p>If he had doubted before, this work convinced him that he was right.
  Yonder sway-backed mountain to the east&mdash;that was unquestionably The
  Crescent. After a time, on the far side of a little mound in the hollow,
  three shovels and as many picks began to flash rhythmically and swiftly. The
  task of digging had commenced.</p>

  <p>Most of the party remained here. But Jack Moon, the Dawns, and two more
  men rode up the course of the creek and disappeared under the pines,
  obviously in search of a good camping place. Ronicky turned Lou to the left
  and cut around the hollow to make out what luck they had.</p>

  <p>He left Lou a short distance back in the woods, after he had come
  reasonably close to the course of the brook, and went out cautiously on foot.
  It was not hard to skulk safely through the forest, since there was a dense
  growth of virgin wood in many places, and, in others, thickets even more
  favorable to secret approaches. So he came to an opening in the woods and
  found there the whole party which had climbed from the hollow. He was quite
  near &mdash;not more than a hundred yards away, perhaps; and he made out the
  face of Hugh Dawn for the first time, standing beside Jack Moon.</p>

  <p>Around them spread five little shanties which in the days of the mines had
  been put up by the laborers close together for the sake of sharing the
  advantages of the natural clearing and enjoying one another's company. Time
  had not completely ruined the little buildings, for they were of logs, rudely
  squared to be sure, but put together solidly enough to stand another
  generation, perhaps. The two men of Moon's band who had joined the party of
  exploration were already busy clearing some fallen logs to the entrance of
  one of the huts.</p>

  <p>This was as much as Ronicky desired to learn. Before late afternoon the
  hut would be occupied, the horses picketed in the rich surrounding meadow,
  and the whole band quartered at ease. Ronicky could not but admire such a
  faultless system as this. The chances were that they would be able to get
  down to the treasure by the digging of a single day. But if they did not,
  here he was equipped with a flawless camp. It was a part of good
  generalship.</p>

  <p>With this much ascertained, Ronicky started back to find Lou and locate
  some close quarters of his own in the near distance.</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">XIV. THE FIRST ATTEMPT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The hole was deepening rapidly. The few hours of work had
brought about
  amazing results, for the ground in this place was a loose mixture of sand and
  gravel; without using picks to loosen it first, the men simply shoveled as
  fast as their arms and backs could swing. They had made the first cut amply
  wide, and now, narrowing the pit at the depth of twelve feet, they left a
  ledge onto which the diggers cast up the dirt while two men on the shelf
  tossed it up again in relay to a great heap which was growing on the lip of
  the cut. They were down sixteen feet, and who could tell when a thrusting
  shovel might strike the treasure? So they were working like mad, never
  speaking, never even pausing to wipe the dropping sweat from their faces.
  Only the occasional grunt of effort rolled up, hollow and dull-sounding, from
  the deep hole.</p>

  <p>"Go up the hill and bring Dawn and his girl," said the chief. "Ought to be
  getting close to twenty feet now, and I want 'em to see as much as we
  see."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, a messenger hurried up the course of the creek to the hut and
  returned to Dawn and the girl. In the meantime, the men had been arranged in
  four shifts by the leader. Three men were always on guard, overlooking the
  hole and at the cabins. Three more dug in the pit, and six were kept in
  reserve. Every half hour the shifts changed. The workers from the pit went up
  to stand their guard. The guard came back to wait for a turn in the pit, and
  three fresh men jumped down to take the shovels whose handles were kept warm
  from the friction of labor.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Dawn and Jerry arrived.</p>

  <p>A tape was now run down the side of the pit, and a shout of exultation
  announced that they had cut a full nineteen feet. They gathered in a rush
  around the edges of the hole, so close, indeed, that the lip of the pit caved
  under one man and precipitated him, tumbling and yelling, to the bottom. But
  he came to his feet, snatched the shovel from the hands of a tired worker,
  and himself assailed the bottom-ground with fury.</p>

  <p>The dirt came up in a steady shower now, and there was no sound but the
  ringing scrape of little stones on the thin metal of the shovel blades as the
  gravel was flung high. The watchers swayed and stooped in harmony with the
  workers, as though by joining the rhythm they were joining the labor and
  helping. Now the tape measured twenty feet at the edges of the hole. In the
  center it reached to twenty-one.</p>

  <p>The laborers paused. Of one accord they raised their gloomy faces to the
  watchers above. Then, with not a word said by those above or those below, the
  task began again. Two more feet the hole was sunk. And then, uncalled, the
  men in the pit clambered to the surface, bringing their tools with them.</p>

  <p>Solid silence continued. The digging of the hole had brought the thought
  of the golden hoard close to every one. For an hour, every time a worker had
  thrust in his shovel and turned the edge against a solid rock, he had jerked
  it out expecting to find the tip bright with glittering yellow. At
  length:</p>

  <p>"We must of made wrong measurements," said Moon. "We sure must of got the
  mountains lined up wrong, boys!"</p>

  <p>No one else ventured to answer until Silas Treat spoke.</p>

  <p>"Jack," he said, "I looked over those sightings. I got 'em lined up
  proper. There's The Vixen; there's The Crescent, and the point at the left is
  the peak of The Crescent. There's Mount Noah, and there's The Ravenhead.
  Don't I know this country like I was born and raised here? No, sir, we sure
  got the right peaks lined up, and we sunk the old hole more'n twenty feet.
  Jack, they simply ain't no treasure here, and old Cosslett, cuss his
  white-livered hulk, had a laugh at us while he was dying! Wish I had him here
  now, so I could plug him once more myself."</p>

  <p>Afterward, Jerry Dawn wondered why that brutal speech did not shock her.
  But at the time she was intent on only one interest&mdash;gold! She paid no
  attention to even the surly faces around her. Here was a problem, and the
  reward for solving it was thousands of pounds of solid gold. She could not
  doubt that the treasure was buried in this vicinity. The slip of paper and
  the figures on it had been real; the code could not have lied to her.</p>

  <p>"But suppose," she said at length, "that Cosslett didn't know this country
  as well as you, Mr. Treat. To him it might be impossible to calculate which
  tip of The Crescent is the highest. It lies there like a new moon, on its
  back. Suppose he took the other tip as his guide and lined it up with Mount
  Noah beyond. That would bring the line farther over to our right."</p>

  <p>She began walking, climbed a little mound, and stood on the top of it,
  shading her eyes and peering under the flat of her hand.</p>

  <p>"Here's where the line would fall, Mr. Treat. And surely the chance is
  worth trying. I know we can't fail."</p>

  <p>The black look with which Jack Moon had been regarding Hugh Dawn cleared a
  little.</p>

  <p>"Boys," he said, "shall we try it? Not now, because we've done a day's
  work already, and night's almost here. But tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>The expectant face of the girl had produced the inevitable reaction. The
  gold fever, which had exhausted them with the first great disappointment,
  returned with new force. There was but one gloomy voice of foreboding.</p>

  <p>"Here's the place, right enough," said Silas Treat, following the girl
  and, like her, squinting to line Mount Noah with the south crest of The
  Crescent, "but look here. How come old Cosslett was so strong he could bury
  his gold under rocks like this one?"</p>

  <p>He pointed to a great boulder on which he was standing. He leaned and laid
  hold on a ragged projecting edge. The rock did not move.</p>

  <p>"Cosslett wasn't never the man I am," he declared. "If I can't budge this
  rock, how come it that old Cosslett could ever have put stones like this in
  the way?"</p>

  <p>"He might have had other men working for him," answered Jack Moon. "That
  ain't hard to explain."</p>

  <p>"Hire gents? Gents that would know where the gold was buried as well as he
  knew? That don't sound like Cosslett! He always played safe!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe when the hole was dug he just up and plugged 'em and buried 'em on
  top of the money," suggested Jack Moon. "That sounds reasonable."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's got a reasonable sound to you," Silas Treat returned gruffly,
  "but it's got a devilish bad sound to me. Anyway, if you want to dig, I'll
  bear a hand. Only, how come these big rocks here?"</p>

  <p>Jerry Dawn pointed up the nearest side of the hollow.</p>

  <p>"See where the trees have been torn away along the hill by a landslide?"
  she exclaimed. "That same landslide must have rolled these rocks down. It
  made the mound, too. And well have to dig through the mound and then twenty
  feet beneath it. But I know that the gold is here! I feel it!"</p>

  <p>"That's what all green hands at prospecting talk like," declared one of
  the men.</p>

  <p>"The girl's talking sense, though," retorted another. "More sense than
  ever come out of your head, Nick! We'll make that try, Jack!"</p>

  <p>"Good!" the leader said.</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">XV. MOTIVES AND MEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The dirt began to crash back into the hole as Jerry Dawn
turned away and
  looked upon the ending of the strangest day of her life. All the forested
  sides of the evergreen hollow were gilded now with sunset colors falling on
  the trees, crimsons and golds of exquisite dimness, pastel shades almost too
  faint for the most exact eye. Beyond, the greater mountaintops walked up to
  the brighter color of the horizon sky, and to the zenith was an infinite
  reach of the eye&mdash;the purity of blue distance.</p>

  <p>The girl drew close to her father with a chastened heart. Looking into his
  seamed, sorrow-worn face, she was able to understand those wild moments of
  his younger life which now placed him in peril. She was able to forgive the
  cruelty of carelessness and neglect which had broken the heart of her mother.
  For the big man was only a product of this big country&mdash;intense in
  passions, big of will, great of heart, and sublime in indifference.</p>

  <p>Such men are needed to make the Western mountains, she thought. If she
  were able to extend her influence around him, how vitally he might be
  changed, and in how short a time! His had been too muscular a nature to
  submit to life and gain lessons from it in his youth. The milder hours of
  receptivity were reserved for his maturer years. She looked on him with a
  touch of pity, a hallowed emotion; she looked on him as she might have looked
  on a child.</p>

  <p>His face, also, had been raised as he followed her glance to the central
  sky. But when he looked down to her he murmured: "Well, Jerry, here's another
  day ending, and I'm still alive!"</p>

  <p>She only took his hand in both of hers and gripped it hard. Her finger
  tips closed over deep, stiff calluses. However wild he might once have been,
  he had proved his worth by the bitter labor which earned money enough to give
  her a schooling. Through her mind flashed in swift procession, memories of
  the letters which had come to her from the East, never with an address to
  guide her answer, for fear that that address might become known to Jack
  Moon.</p>

  <p>Each letter had contained a money order; and about each money order was
  always wrapped a bit of paper over which, in a sprawling, stiff hand, were
  traced a few formal words. Their formality she had not been able to
  understand until she grew much older. And then she knew that it is typical of
  the uneducated. The written word is to them a fearsome thing. Their thoughts
  come forth haltingly on paper. They blush at attempted tenderness. They feel
  that they are addressing the world, and therefore they write to their nearest
  and dearest as though they were writing to strangers.</p>

  <p>She was still thinking of these things when she heard the deep and musical
  voice of Jack Moon behind her. It was a voice rare indeed! It might have been
  used to move thousands of men. And always when the man spoke she was
  conscious of the strong mind, the strong will behind the words. There was
  ever something about Jack Moon as strong as his muscles, as big as his body.
  Beyond the power of the flesh there was a secondary power of the spirit. The
  longer she saw him, the more she knew of him, the greater seemed the extent
  of the undiscovered bourn behind his eyes.</p>

  <p>He was giving his orders for the night, and he issued them with a military
  precision. To some he gave the task of collecting wood for the big camp fire
  which was to be built in the central space among the huts. Others still would
  care for the unpacking. A third crew would do the cooking. And finally the
  fourth would relieve the two watchers in the forest, who were keeping ward
  against Ronicky Doone, and would call them toward the cabins, where a fresh
  guard must be mounted all night to keep off the expected marauder.</p>

  <p>With this accomplished, the bandit leader overtook Hugh Dawn and his
  daughter.</p>

  <p>"You, Dawn," he said gruffly; "maybe you think you got a free ticket to
  chuck and bed and everything, eh? Not a hope of that, son! You mosey along
  and do your share. You can help the boys with the unpacking. Treat will give
  you orders just what to do. And mind that you keep in sight. No trying to run
  off through the trees. Treat has a terrible nervous trigger finger. Now off
  with you! Go tell Treat that I sent you!"</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn cast a glance at his daughter and then departed.</p>

  <p>"And now," said Moon, his voice changed adroitly to fit her hearing, "I
  got a chance to talk to you private. I been wanting to all day, but one thing
  or another kept coming up. What I got to say is this: Me and the boys all
  like you fine, and we aim to give you as good a time as we can, considering
  everything."</p>

  <p>She turned a little and looked him squarely in the eye, smiling
  whimsically.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Jack Moon, grave before her subdued mirth, "that that
  sounds pretty queer to you. I suppose that you got us all wrote down as man-
  eaters that do a couple of murders before breakfast to work up an appetite.
  That it?"</p>

  <p>She examined him somewhat cautiously. She had always thought that the
  fellow was far too intelligent to have any illusions about himself or about
  what others might think of him. Now, searching for a trace of stupidity or of
  weak conceit, she was unable to find it. She saw a noble cast of features,
  strange only in their unvarying pallor. She had heard of men like this
  before, whose skins were apparently impervious to the burning rays of the
  mountain suns, but Moon was the first she had seen.</p>

  <p>Aside from his complexion, however, there was nothing curious about his
  make-up. The mouth was generously large, and formed with a promise of
  sensitiveness. The chin was cut in a manner to suggest plenty of solid bone
  beneath. The nose was straight, large enough to give dominance to his face,
  but perfectly formed. The eyes were large and well separated, and they looked
  straight as the flight of an arrow. The forehead above was magnificently high
  and broad, and crowning all was a luxuriant mass of chestnut-colored hair.
  His face, indeed, was like his body, flawless in proportions; and the
  unmanageable hair suggested the mane of a lion&mdash;a leonine head, a
  leonine nature formed to command. By his looks, by his voice, by his glance,
  he could have been picked among ten thousand chosen men.</p>

  <p>It suddenly came to her that perhaps such a fellow, framed for
  superiority, might have chafed against the bonds of society, learned the
  fierce empire of the outlawed world, and broken away to it.</p>

  <p>"I thought," she said, deciding that frankness was entirely permissible
  with such a man, "that you would understand everything. I thought you
  wouldn't make friendly speeches that seem to require friendly answers.
  Because, you know, I have to do what I'm expected to do. If you want
  friendliness, I'll have to act the part. Is that the order?"</p>

  <p>He smiled again, enjoying her mood.</p>

  <p>"What's always queer to me about folks like you," he said, "clean-bred,
  clean-raised, clean-taught, is that you ain't got the imagination to put
  yourselves in the boots of the other fellow. You see, we know we're a hard
  lot. We know you know it. But we figured you to have a sense of humor, lady.
  We figured you'd be able to forget what can't be helped for a day or two, and
  make yourself sociable. Understand?</p>

  <p>"Back in the old days they had what they called The Truce of Heaven. I
  think it lasted from Thursday nights to Mondays. I dunno for sure, but a
  schoolteacher told me about it once. Those were the times when every gent
  done his bit of fighting pretty regular and counted a week lost that didn't
  see him whaling away at some other gent in armor. Well, when Thursday night
  come, they quit the fighting. They laid off their armor and called on their
  enemies and sat down and had a smoke together, so to speak&mdash;because they
  wasn't any use talking mean and acting mean between Thursday and Monday.
  Well, I thought it was kind of the same way with us. Suppose it takes us a
  couple of days to dig that next hole. Does it pay for us to keep our claws
  out all the time during them two days? Can't we use the velvet paw, lady?
  Can't we call it The Truce of Heaven till we sink that hole and find out if
  the treasure of Cosslett is down under it."</p>

  <p>"And if the treasure isn't there?"</p>

  <p>"Then out come the claws. I have a bargain with your father, lady. You
  know that!"</p>

  <p>She shuddered.</p>

  <p>"But that's a good way off&mdash;two days, three days&mdash;three
  centuries!" he suggested.</p>

  <p>She nodded, intensely curious at this working of his mind.</p>

  <p>"You'd gain one thing," he said. "If you'd give me your word not to try to
  leave and get to a town through the mountains, I'd parole you. Savvy?"</p>

  <p>"You would accept my word?" she queried.</p>

  <p>"As free as you'd accept mine," he answered at once.</p>

  <p>She bit her lips to keep back the smile.</p>

  <p>"I know," he said. "But when you come to think it over, you would take my
  word on anything. Go all through the mountains. That's what I'm known as
  &mdash;a gent that never busted a promise. Lot of other things charged up
  again' me, but never a real promise that I've broke."</p>

  <p>"For instance," she said, "last night you promised that Ronicky Doone
  would be received as a friend, and yet your men opened fire on him!"</p>

  <p>"Sure," he replied, absolutely unabashed. "I just stated that he'd be
  received that way. I didn't promise. I didn't take no oath. I didn't give
  anybody my hand on it."</p>

  <p>She observed the distinction with a thoughtful mind. There was a
  distinction. Even the low took heed of the difference between an oath and a
  mere given word.</p>

  <p>"It's hard for me to sympathize with that viewpoint," she said coldly. "In
  my world we could not call it fair play."</p>

  <p>"I'm not asking for sympathy," he replied readily. "Not a bit. I ain't
  asking you to step inside my world. But I want to find out if my world is so
  plumb far away from yours that you can't even see it through a telescope, so
  to speak. Is it?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said, "I think I can understand a good many things. And I'll
  give you my word that I won't attempt to escape until&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He did not wait for her to finish the difficult sentence.</p>

  <p>"Mind shaking on that?" he said.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>They shook hands. His palm was as soft as a woman's, well nigh. No labor
  had ever hardened it. For some reason the touch of that hand convinced her
  more than a thousand words, a thousand deeds, of the essential evil of the
  man.</p>

  <p>"This is fine!" he said. "We'll have a couple of good days out of this.
  Why not? Every minute you save out of being sad is a minute that's
  gained."</p>

  <p>"But what if sorrow comes afterward?"</p>

  <p>"Well, what happens tomorrow doesn't change what happens today."</p>

  <p>It was the root, she felt, of his philosophy.</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," she said cautiously. Then she became frank again. After
  all, he was distinctly worth frankness. Good or bad, he was a man.
  "Everything is very new to me here, as you understand. I'm trying to make it
  out."</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd postpone judging me for a while," he begged. "Will you do
  that? I know it's hard for you to make me out. You can't know how a gent gets
  hungry to be free."</p>

  <p>"I think I do know," she insisted. "I've met Ronicky Doone, and if ever
  there was a man who lives to be free, it is he!"</p>

  <p>Her head went up with her enthusiasm; his head went down in thought, and
  he examined her with a keen glance.</p>

  <p>"You figure he's a lot better than the ordinary, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you? But then, you don't know him."</p>

  <p>"Lady," said the other, "I know him like a book."</p>

  <p>"You've met him?"</p>

  <p>"Never laid eyes on his face."</p>

  <p>"You admit it!"</p>

  <p>"I don't have to. I've heard about him. He's too important for me not to
  have heard. Gents like him and me can't live within a thousand miles of each
  other without knowing what the other fellow is."</p>

  <p>"But he doesn't know you."</p>

  <p>"Sure he don't. That's where he's weaker."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Weaker?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I said. He's got his parts. But he's too much of a fighter to
  be at the top of any game."</p>

  <p>It was so absurd that she laughed. "You object to fighting?" she said.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd try to understand," he said, irritated. "You can if you want
  to. But you can't get all I mean with the first jump of your mind, every
  time. Sure I object to fighting. That's a last resource. Gents that do
  nothing but fight their way into trouble and out of it are like wolves. No
  better. They're beasts. Maybe fine beasts, but beasts just the same. What
  makes men different? Brains, lady, brains! It ain't how hard a gent can hit
  or how quick and straight he can shoot. It's what he's got above the eyes.
  Understand me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I understand you; and of course I agree." She was piqued by his
  bluntness. And yet at the same time it made her wish more than ever to have
  his respect. The respect of Jack Moon! Afterward, she would marvel at herself
  and her mood during that talk! "But you have to admit that it sounds queer
  coming from Jack Moon."</p>

  <p>"Sure&mdash;Jack Moon the way you know him now. Not the Jack Moon I hope
  you'll get to know."</p>

  <p>"Do you really want me to know you? Wouldn't you be less strong, less
  invincible, if any one really understood you?"</p>

  <p>"You won't," said he calmly. "But I'm going to show you my insides if I
  can. The more you show of yourself the more people miss you."</p>

  <p>"Where are your weaknesses?" she said.</p>

  <p>"That's asking. But I'll tell you. I'm vain. I like to be flattered."</p>

  <p>"But you intend to be forearmed, I see!"</p>

  <p>"Don't do any good to be prepared for a thing. That's my weakness. You'd
  laugh if you knew the way it works. Ain't a man in my crowd that I don't want
  to have respect me. If I can't get 'em to love me, I want 'em to fear me; and
  you can lay to it that they all do!"</p>

  <p>"And that flatters you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. Take you, for instance. If I can't make you like me&mdash;
  like to talk to me; of course I don't mean anything more'n that&mdash;then
  the next best is to have you shake every time I come near you."</p>

  <p>She looked at him out of narrowed eyes. And she knew that the fellow was
  actually telling the truth! And yet the door he had opened let in only enough
  light upon his involute nature to give her a deceptive feeling of knowledge.
  The main theme&mdash;the key to the mystery&mdash;was still farther
  beyond.</p>

  <p>"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, I'm afraid," she said. "I'm not
  going to use what I know."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said the outlaw. "Here we are almost home!"</p>

  <p>The clearing of the shacks was before them, and the crowd, which had
  hurried on ahead of them, was already busy at twenty preparations for the
  night and the evening meal. The sunset was touching only the tops of the
  trees now. All beneath was swiftly deepening shadow.</p>

  <p>"However," she said as a parting shot, "I'm going to maintain that there
  are two types of freedom&mdash;yours and Ronicky's!"</p>

  <p>"You know him well enough to call him Ronicky?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And he calls you Jerry!"</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"No harm. Well, I tell you what: I could take this Ronicky Doone and wind
  him around my finger. I could make him my man! I could get him into my crowd
  if I wanted to!"</p>

  <p>She flushed with her anger.</p>

  <p>"That's simply impossible! Ronicky Doone? He's the soul of everything
  honorable!"</p>

  <p>"Actions speak, lady," and Jack Moon grinned. "Suppose I was to go out and
  bring him into this camp!"</p>

  <p>"You could only bring him dead!"</p>

  <p>"That so? I'd bet on it, though."</p>

  <p>"As a member of your band?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I said. Have him in here sleeping right along with the rest
  of the boys. He'd take Harry Bush's place!"</p>

  <p>"You can't do it, Jack Moon! I&mdash;unless you're a hypnotist."</p>

  <p>"You're weakening," said the other coldly. "Must be kind of fond of this
  gent if you can't believe anything wrong about him!"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you this," she said firmly. "If he came down here as a member
  of your band, I'd despise him with all my heart. I'd loathe him!"</p>

  <p>"That's hard on me," remarked Jack Moon. "But it sounds to me like a bet.
  What say? Shall I go out and try to get him down here?"</p>

  <p>"If you go to face him, you'd risk your life!"</p>

  <p>"Not the first time. Besides, it'd be worth it."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"To see your face when I bring him in. Shall I try?"</p>

  <p>"You'll gain nothing from me, sir!" She was trembling with excitement.
  "But go out. Try him. If he's as weak as that, then there's no steady faith,
  no honesty, no truth in any man in the world! But how&mdash;how could you get
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Ain't there gold over yonder? Wouldn't he like a share in it?"</p>

  <p>"You'd buy him!"</p>

  <p>"They say everybody has a price, and I can bid pretty high right now!"</p>

  <p>"You'll fail, Jack Moon!"</p>

  <p>He laughed mockingly and turned abruptly on his heel and strode out into
  the shade of the trees.</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">XVI. BROKEN FAITH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">His first hundred yards were made at a rapid pace, but
after that, finding
  himself entirely alone and well out of possible observation from behind, he
  reduced his gait and went on more slowly, more cautiously, keeping a sharp
  lookout through the tree trunks around him. Indeed, so sensitive had he
  suddenly become that now and again he paused and whirled toward the movement
  of a wind-swayed sapling or the swing of a bough. His progress, however, was
  fairly steady. He paused only to break off a slender dead branch some six
  feet long, and at the top of this he tied a white handkerchief.</p>

  <p>In this wise he broke from the trees and came into the clearing at the
  bottom of the hollow. He must now be well beyond earshot of the camp, and
  suddenly he began to shout: "Doone! Ronicky Doone! Oh, Doone!"</p>

  <p>He repeated the call in a high and piercing wail several times, and yet it
  was strange that he should expect the man to come to what might well be
  considered a trap. Strange, too, that he should expect to find him so near
  the scene of danger. Yet at the third repetition of the call a voice spoke
  behind him.</p>

  <p>"I'm here. What's the racket about?"</p>

  <p>He turned slowly, very slowly. It was a maxim with him that quick moves
  were very dangerous.</p>

  <p>He found himself looking at Ronicky Doone, though the latter was so
  covered with a mottling of shadows that he was almost rendered invisible. It
  was a sort of protective coloration&mdash;or shadowing, to be more
  accurate.</p>

  <p>"Been following me long?" said the outlaw, leaning on his branch.</p>

  <p>"Only since you started away from the shacks," said Ronicky.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," and Moon sighed, "you sure are handy in a forest. Must of
  learned young."</p>

  <p>"Tolerable."</p>

  <p>"Ain't it kind of dangerous trusting yourself on foot, when we got so many
  men to cut in around you on hossback?"</p>

  <p>As a reply Ronicky whistled very softly, so softly that it barely reached
  the ears of the bandit leader, and out of the denser night of the trees
  behind Ronicky came the form of Lou. She was almost lost in the sea of
  shadow. Only her head, with the pricking ears and the bright eyes, appeared
  at the shoulder of her master.</p>

  <p>"By Jiminy!" exclaimed Jack Moon, smiling with an almost boyish pleasure.
  "That's sure a hoss, that one of yours. Lou?"</p>

  <p>"You've heard of her?"</p>

  <p>"Everybody that's heard of you has heard of her, if they have any ears to
  listen to folks' talk," said the other. "She's handy herself, ain't she? How
  come she don't make any more noise going through a wood?"</p>

  <p>"Training," answered Ronicky Doone. "Took a pile of pains."</p>

  <p>"I reckon!"</p>

  <p>"But now she knows enough not to step where the dead leaves are thick or
  on a branch or nothing like that. Besides, I've got her so's she knows when
  she ain't to make any noise like whinnying."</p>

  <p>"That must of took time, Ronicky!"</p>

  <p>"About two years, training her every day."</p>

  <p>"You don't say! Well, you sure are the out-beatingest gent for patience,
  Ronicky!"</p>

  <p>The other returned no answer. It was very strange to hear them conversing
  in so frank a manner, making no mysteries with each other&mdash;the one
  asking simple questions, the other answering them with fully as much
  simplicity. One might have thought them old and familiar acquaintances.
  Neither had raised his voice since Ronicky answered the third call.</p>

  <p>"How come you to foller so close?" went on Jack Moon.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to kill you, Moon," said the smaller man, as gentle of voice as
  ever.</p>

  <p>"The devil you are!" murmured Moon, also without violence. "How come?"</p>

  <p>"They won't hear the gun. Not with that wood-chopping going on and at this
  distance."</p>

  <p>"No, maybe not. And then what?"</p>

  <p>"Hide your body and then drift back to the camp and get Dawn and the girl
  tonight."</p>

  <p>"You agin' a dozen?"</p>

  <p>"A dozen? They's only a man and a half in that camp. And you're the whole
  man, partner."</p>

  <p>"I take that kind of you, Ronicky."</p>

  <p>"Don't mention it."</p>

  <p>"But they'll have numbers on you!"</p>

  <p>"Numbers ain't anything. Not in night work. Not when you got the instinct
  for shooting. I'd sort of like it."</p>

  <p>"You would?"</p>

  <p>"Yep. I never met up with so many gents that was all ripe for shooting,
  Moon. And I sure would like to get busy right among all them targets."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you get a job with a sheriff?" asked Moon. "That'd keep your
  hand in on the work you like."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't make it professional. I ain't that low. I shoot to kill when I
  have to, that's all."</p>

  <p>"But you sort of like to have to, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I guess that's it. Ah!"</p>

  <p>The last monosyllable was a snarl of eagerness, and the hand of Ronicky
  flashed down to his revolver&mdash;but it came away again and rested
  carelessly on his hip. He had mistaken a movement of the outlaw's right
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," said Ronicky.</p>

  <p>"That's all right. I got steady nerves. Well, Ronicky, it's sure fine to
  have met you after hearing so much about you. And it's fine to see you so
  fit."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Ronicky. "I'm waiting for you to start something,
  Jack."</p>

  <p>"Want me to start for my gat first? I never take gifts, Ronicky. They cost
  too much!"</p>

  <p>"H'm!" said Ronicky. "You're a queer bird, Jack."</p>

  <p>"Yep. That's right. I'm queer. Pretty near as queer as you. You're so sure
  you'd beat me if we come to pulling guns."</p>

  <p>"That ain't queer," said Ronicky. "It's just a feeling you get."</p>

  <p>"Like shooting in the dark?"</p>

  <p>"Kind of. I know I'm a faster man than you, Jack. Shooting you is pretty
  near to murder&mdash;except that you been such a devil that you deserve a
  thousand killings."</p>

  <p>"Thanks! But they ain't going to be no gun play, son."</p>

  <p>"No?"</p>

  <p>"I've said they wasn't, and I mean it. You're going to come back in camp
  with me. You're going to come back as one of my men."</p>

  <p>Ronicky started and then shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You got me figured all wrong," he said patiently. "I ain't your kind,
  Jack."</p>

  <p>"Nobody is," said the other. "But you'll come."</p>

  <p>"To get a share of the Cosslett gold if it's found?"</p>

  <p>"D'you think I'd try to buy you with gold, Ronicky? Son, you must think
  I'm a plumb fool. No, money ain't your price."</p>

  <p>"I got a price, have I?"</p>

  <p>"I'll show you. You'll come into camp with me because you want to get Dawn
  and the girl off."</p>

  <p>"Well? Ain't they made a bargain? They show you the treasure, and you set
  'em free."</p>

  <p>"You know as well as me that they ain't any treasure, son. I'm digging
  just for the fun of it. One chance in a thousand, maybe, and it's worth the
  try."</p>

  <p>"Moon," said the other, straightening, "it ain't any good. I know
  you."</p>

  <p>"You're the only gent in the world that does, then," said Jack Moon.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you think that. Maybe you're right. I don't want to get close
  enough to a gent like you to find out the truth. I want to put on gloves when
  I handle you."</p>

  <p>"That's sort of strong, son!"</p>

  <p>"Curse you!" said Ronicky Doone, his voice trembling suddenly with a
  horror and loathing which he had been repressing all of this time. "I can
  understand and forgive some gents for killing. Some men kill because they go
  plumb mad with anger. And I'd forgive them. But you&mdash;you're never going
  to lose your temper. You're not fond of nothing but yourself. You kill
  because things get in your way. You kill by rule, the way other folks build a
  house or do 'rithmetic. Moon, of all the gents I ever hear about, you're the
  worst. I'm going to finish you, right here under these trees!"</p>

  <p>"Sure sorry!" the outlaw chuckled. "But, Ronicky, I won't fight!"</p>

  <p>The other gasped.</p>

  <p>"You? Not fight? Jack Moon not fight?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I said."</p>

  <p>"You lie!"</p>

  <p>"Nope. Why should I get myself dropped? Right now I know you're a better
  man than I am."</p>

  <p>"Moon, I'm going to pull my gun. Defend yourself like a man, or I'll shoot
  you like the skunk you are!"</p>

  <p>But Jack Moon dropped both hands on his hips and smiled straight at the
  set face of Ronicky Doone.</p>

  <p>"You can't do it, Ronicky," he said. "That's the trouble with fools like
  you. You can't do a lot of things you ought to do. You won't shoot till I
  move for my gun. I ain't going to move!"</p>

  <p>"I'll let the mountains know you're yaller, Moon!"</p>

  <p>"Tell the mountains, then. None of the men would believe it."</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone ground his teeth, knowing the truth.</p>

  <p>"Come out with your game, Jack," he said at last. "How you going to get
  me? Why d'you want me? How come you think I'm such a fool I'll go into your
  camp with you where I'd be helpless?"</p>

  <p>The leader laughed softly, more to himself&mdash;an inward mirth.</p>

  <p>"D'you expect me to answer all them questions? All I'll tell you is this:
  I'm going to get you into camp so's I can down you by myself, Ronicky. You're
  a better man than me right now. The first I've ever met! But after I've had
  you with me for twenty-four hours, you'll begin to get weak&mdash;without
  knowing it. And when the bust comes, I'll win! That's the main reason!"</p>

  <p>"You think I'm a plumb fool, Jack," said Ronicky. "Come into your camp?
  What'd make me want to do that?"</p>

  <p>"Because you're weak in the head," said the outlaw, with the utmost calm.
  "You took up Dawn's fight for no good reason, and now you got to fight it
  through, or you can't never respect yourself again. And the only way you can
  help Dawn is by getting into camp, where you and Dawn can try to make your
  break side by side or fight us to the finish back to back! You know that, and
  that's why you'll take my offer. You talk about rushing the camp at night.
  That's fool talk. You know's well as I know that the first shot fired would
  be by my man Treat into the head of Hugh Dawn."</p>

  <p>Ronicky glowered. Indeed, the bait was almost irresistible, even though he
  was warned at the same time that, if he took it, the trap would close over
  him sooner or later.</p>

  <p>"You can come in with me," said Jack Moon, "but when you come, you got to
  act like one of my men. And I'll make them like it! They'll want to finish
  you the first week or so. But you'll take care of that. I trust you to sort
  of make your own way!"</p>

  <p>He grinned at Ronicky with malevolent meaning.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I was to start a riot and shoot up some of your men, Jack? Think
  about that?"</p>

  <p>"You won't do it. You ain't the kind that can kill without cause. You'll
  just bluff them down."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Ronicky started.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I was to take up your offer&mdash;which I ain't going to do, of
  course&mdash;what would Dawn and the girl think, not knowing the truth, and
  thinking that I've took the oath and become one of your men? I didn't think
  of that before!"</p>

  <p>"They'll think you're a skunk," said Jack Moon. "That's the main reason I
  want to get you there. The girl's too fond of you."</p>

  <p>Again Ronicky started.</p>

  <p>"Talk soft about her," he said fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Sure," and the outlaw nodded. "I like her fine. No fear of me talking
  hard about her. Matter of fact, I'm bringing you in so's I can show her that
  I've done what I told her I'd do&mdash;wind you right around my little
  finger!"</p>

  <p>"You swine!" muttered Ronicky.</p>

  <p>"What difference does that make? Even if she despises you for a couple of
  days, won't you still have your chance to play hero later on and save her and
  her father? And when you get away with them, can't you explain how everything
  lies?" He paused, then added: "But while you're in camp you'll explain
  nothing to nobody. I'll have your word on that before you go in!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not going in," said Ronicky. "I got a little sense left!"</p>

  <p>"You're afraid I'll hypnotize you, or something?" said the leader. "Afraid
  of my men? Far as that goes, I'll give you my word that I won't let the crowd
  jump you. A couple might try to measure you, but you can take care of
  yourself, I reckon. Later on, when I'm ready, you and me'll have it out! Make
  your play, Ronicky. Will you come, or will you just hang around here in the
  trees and do no good? You can't get help. You know I got enough on Dawn to
  have him sent up or executed along with me if we're caught. And I'd sure bust
  myself wide open to do it. One down, all down. That's my motto."</p>

  <p>Ronicky sighed. "I'm coming," he said. "I'm coming. Jack. I start in
  feeling that I'm beat. You're too clever for me. But I ain't going to admit
  I'm beat till you drop me full of lead as a roast is full of cloves. Lead on,
  partner."</p>

  <p>"You understand everything?"</p>

  <p>"I go in and let on that I've took the oath to stick with your crowd."</p>

  <p>"And you promise that you won't use what you might learn from the boys if
  they should get to talking promiscuous to you about what we've done in the
  old days."</p>

  <p>"I'll promise that. I'm not to do any explaining to anybody, the girl in
  particular. I'm to work under your orders until I get my chance to make my
  own play. Same time you contract that you won't send your whole crowd after
  me. That's what we shake on?"</p>

  <p>"That's what we shake on. The only show-down will be between you and me.
  The girl&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Leave her out," said Ronicky sharply.</p>

  <p>The other laughed. "Anyway you want. But I'm going to show her that I'm a
  better man than you are."</p>

  <p>"She's got too much sense not to see through you, Moon!"</p>

  <p>"Has she? I like 'em clever, Doone. They play better into my hand when
  they're that way! Do we shake hands and start back?"</p>

  <p>Ronicky bowed his head, though never for an instant taking his eyes off
  the big figure in front of him. A few minutes before he had been on the point
  of drawing his revolver and shooting to kill. But the man had bound his arms
  with an invisible cord and had netted him in an hypnotic influence. He felt
  that to bow to the will of the outlaw would be disastrous. Yet, was it not
  cowardice to refuse? Was there really anything to dread save mob action on
  the part of the crowd? If he could trust Moon's word to prevent such action,
  what else was there to worry over? In the meantime, the man to whom he had
  given his promise that he would see him through to the end was a helpless,
  hopeless prisoner in the midst of the band.</p>

  <p>"I'll go," said Ronicky at last, "on your own terms. You take me in to
  prove to the girl that I'm crooked. I accept because I want to get the girl
  and her father loose. We both have our eyes open&mdash;we play the
  game&mdash; we hope to plant each other under the sod in the end. Let's start
  back!"</p>

  <p>"Good!" said the outlaw, and, stepping briskly forth to lead the way, he
  began laughing softly to himself.</p>

  <p>As for Ronicky, his mind was in a whirl of doubts as he followed. This was
  not his sphere, this atmosphere of trickery and suspicion. He was meant for
  swift decisions swiftly acted upon. But, having committed himself to this
  course of action, he could do nothing but submit and let chance bring what it
  would. At least, he could be constantly on the alert, and if Moon strove to
  strike by surprise the blow might recoil on his own head.</p>

  <p>They came to the edge of the clearing. The shacks were indistinct masses
  of shadow now, save for the faces on which the firelight struck. A mass of
  dead logs had been heaped in the center of the open space, and the flames
  from them leaped straight up until the wind, which stirred above the
  treetops, lopped off the fire in great billows and extinguished them in waves
  of darkness.</p>

  <p>This fire was for the purpose of giving heat, as the night was coming on
  chill; the cooking fire was a much humbler affair drawn well to one side.
  Scattered about it was the expectant circle. What Ronicky Doone saw was a
  blur of strong, ill-shaven faces, alternately played upon by light and shade
  as the men leaned toward the fire or sat back. Next he saw the shining hair
  of the girl, turning to red gold where the firelight struck through it.</p>

  <p>She sat with her fingers locked about her knees, and she was talking with
  animation to the solemn-faced Silas Treat, her nearest neighbor on the right.
  Hugh Dawn flanked her on the other side.</p>

  <p>"Looks kind of at home already, don't she?" asked Jack Moon. "She's one in
  a thousand, that girl!"</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Ronicky Doone. "She's smart enough to know how to act a
  part."</p>

  <p>But he was ill at ease. If in five minutes the outlaw leader had been able
  to change the mind of a man bent on killing him, and had brought the would-
  be combatant peaceably back to his camp and really into his power, what could
  he not do with a girl of an impressionable age? Something must be done about
  this. The girl must be warned sharply to be on her guard, not against
  physical danger, because that could not exist among Westerners for her, but
  against the insidious words of Jack Moon.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Moon read his thoughts and defied him.</p>

  <p>"I'll make a place for you between Treat and the girl," he said. "You see,
  I figure to keep you happy, Ronicky!"</p>

  <p>He stepped forward to the girl, and Ronicky saw her lift her head with a
  start and then stare beyond the leader into the darkness. Seeing no
  one&mdash; perhaps the firelight blinded her&mdash;she laughed and seemed
  highly pleased. Then he made out Moon's voice saying: "Thought you'd be
  getting lonely, maybe, among all us rough gents. So I brought you a
  friend."</p>

  <p>At that she started to her feet, and Ronicky came on toward her, smiling.
  At sight of him she stiffened, at first as though in horror, and then with an
  exclamation of scorn which Ronicky Doone was never to forget.</p>

  <p>"Don't come near me!" she cried fiercely. "Don't come near me! Jack Moon,
  I'd rather have any member of your crew beside me than that&mdash;creature! I
  thought there was one man in the world who valued himself above a price. But
  now I see there's none. None!"</p>

  <p>"Jerry," said Ronicky eagerly, "inside of three days you'll know the truth
  about this."</p>

  <p>"For money!" breathed the girl, white of face. "Sold for money! Why, a man
  like Jack Moon who defies the law is far finer than you! At least he isn't
  sold. He may buy, but he's never bought!"</p>

  <p>"I could talk forever now," said Ronicky, "and never show you why I'm
  here. But when the time comes, you'll know."</p>

  <p>"Whatever you say," she replied, "remember this: I don't care to hear you.
  You've sold more than yourself. You've sold my faith in you. And that can be
  sold only once. This is the last word I'll address to you, sir!"</p>

  <p>She turned her back and sat down.</p>

  <p>"I didn't figure," said Jack Moon, "that you'd come so close to saying
  kind things about me so soon."</p>

  <p>"Kind?" she answered. Suddenly her anger melted almost to the point of
  tears. "Don't you see I hate you for what you've done to him? It&mdash;it's
  worse than killing a man. It's devilish, this buying of a soul!"</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17">XVII. REWARD OF SERVICE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">But the leader seemed quite unperturbed by her words. He
turned cheerfully
  to the circle of men, and they interrupted their own talk to stare at the
  newcomer.</p>

  <p>"Gents," said Moon, "this is Ronicky Doone. I've brought him around to our
  way of thinking. I want you to take to him, and I'm pretty sure that he'll
  take to us. I guess they ain't anybody here that'd vote agin' letting Ronicky
  have a share of the plunder if we find Cosslett's gold. If they is, speak
  up!"</p>

  <p>Ronicky could see the point of this speech. Without making a definite
  statement, the bandit allowed it to be clearly inferred that the offer of a
  share in the gold had been the purchase price of the new member of the band.
  Now the wave of silence traveled around the circle, and keen eyes looked at
  him from under grimly gathered brows.</p>

  <p>Silas Treat spoke first. "This kid looks tolerable young to me. I got a
  right to talk. Any gent that's brought in may be sent out with me to do a
  little job later on. I want to know what he'll turn when it comes to taking a
  trick. How does he ride? How does he shoot? What does he know? What's he
  done?"</p>

  <p>I'll answer that," said the leader. "First place, I'll answer for him as a
  fighting man. They ain't such a thing as luck in a gun play. Or if there is,
  lucky gents are what we want. I've heard about Doone for two years. Take too
  long to tell you all. But the first of you that gets tangled with him, will
  find out a bunch of things pronto. About the rest&mdash;well, call your hoss,
  Ronicky!"</p>

  <p>Wondering what point there could be in this, Ronicky whistled sharply, and
  from behind came the swift beating of hoofs. The bay mare shot into the
  circle of the firelight and stood, a gleaming, beautiful figure, beside her
  master. There she fidgeted, turning this way and that and eying the bandits
  with uneasy glances, as though she were not at all pleased to find her owner
  in such company.</p>

  <p>"Look her over, boys," said Moon. "Is they a hoss in the outfit that can
  touch her? Is a hoss like that ever going to be run down on the trail? And
  can't you judge a gent pretty much by the hoss he rides?"</p>

  <p>These words were to a large degree drowned by the murmur which had risen
  simultaneously from many throats, drawn forth by the exquisite lines of Lou.
  All doubt at once vanished.</p>

  <p>"Glad to see you, pal," said Silas Treat, advancing across the circle
  until he loomed huge above Ronicky, and he stretched forth his hand. It was
  not taken, and Treat drew himself back a pace.</p>

  <p>"Gents," said Ronicky, "I sure appreciate being taken in. But you don't
  know me yet. Wait till you've found out what I am. If you feel the same way
  then&mdash;why, we'll shake hands. But you can't tell in the beginning of
  some things how they're going to end. Just leave this up in the air. Later on
  &mdash;well, we'll know each other a pile better!"</p>

  <p>The speech was well received, particularly by Silas Treat.</p>

  <p>"That sounds like more sense than I figure on hearing out of a gent ten
  years older than you, son," he declared. "All right. We'll try you out, but I
  aim to say that I think you'll live up to standard fine! How about it,
  boys?"</p>

  <p>There was a growl of assent. The bright eyes still probed suspiciously at
  Ronicky, but there was a willingness now to find some measure of good in him.
  But Ronicky was delighted because he had avoided giving his hand to the whole
  circle. That would have tied him down. Now he was frankly on trial with the
  band and the band was on trial with him. He glanced at Moon and saw that the
  leader was biting his lips in vexation. He, at least, was clever enough to
  understand the meaning of Ronicky's maneuver.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Ronicky sat down, withdrawing a little from the intimate,
  inner circle about the fire. He looked squarely across at the girl. She was
  talking quite gayly with her father. Now and then some one of the men
  addressed a remark to her, and she answered. But always, in flitting here and
  there, her glance became a blank when it passed over the spot where Ronicky
  was sitting.</p>

  <p>This hurt him; and the injustice was inclined to make him sulk. Yet he
  could not help admiring her, even impersonally. Here, playing her part among
  men who might, within two or three days, be the murderers of her father,
  striving with all her force to gain such a hold upon them that in the crisis
  she might be able to turn them from their purpose, she was at her very best.
  Firelight had turned the sand-colored hair to a rich gold; excitement brought
  color to her cheeks and set her eyes gleaming.</p>

  <p>"Look here," said a voice from the far side of the circle. "Ain't you
  going to change seats after a while, Treat? D'you sit beside the lady all
  evening?"</p>

  <p>"I ain't heard her shouting out loud for you to come and rescue her," said
  Treat.</p>

  <p>"You see," explained the girl, "I plan to take Si back with me."</p>

  <p>"And why not me, too?" came a chorus.</p>

  <p>"Because you're all known men," she answered. "But Si carries his mask
  about with him."</p>

  <p>Silas Treat stroked the dense mustaches and beard which had inspired the
  remark and grinned down at the girl. As the laughter died, Baldy McNair
  slipped into a place beside Ronicky.</p>

  <p>"You were lying up in the barn the other night," he said. "You heard me
  and Marty talking, I understand?"</p>

  <p>"That's it."</p>

  <p>"And that was what started you going?"</p>

  <p>"Yep."</p>

  <p>Baldy McNair sighed.</p>

  <p>"Well," he murmured at length, "you started on the trail of doing a pretty
  good thing. I'm sort of sorry, partner, to see you wind up in this joint.
  But&mdash;that ain't my business."</p>

  <p>Ronicky looked steadily into the open eyes of the ruddy-faced man.</p>

  <p>"I'll get to know you better," he said. "I'd like to, a pile."</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the outlaw chief had taken a place just behind Jerry
  Dawn, and gradually he drew her attention away from the circle and into
  earnest conversation with himself. Ronicky noted the changes from positive
  distaste, which she could barely conquer at first, to interest and then even
  to excitement. What they said was pitched well beneath the sustained chatter
  of the men, but by the expression of the girl Ronicky knew that she was by no
  means unhappy in the company of Moon.</p>

  <p>He shook his head in wonder. It seemed utterly impossible that she could
  stay near him for an instant&mdash;near this man whose known crimes were too
  numerous for memory, and whose unknown deeds made probably an even blacker
  record. But he knew that women have strange powers of forgetfulness. The past
  of Jack Moon no doubt was beginning to grow dim in her mind. The present was
  all she was capable of knowing. Even the future danger impending over her
  father was probably forgotten for the moment. All she saw, all she heard,
  were the handsome face, the smooth voice of Jack Moon, leader of men.</p>

  <p>Indeed, between a king and the ruler of a pirate crew there is a
  similarity. To be a single robber is a despicable thing; to be a mighty
  leader of robbers is to be&mdash;a Tamerlane, perhaps. And if Jack Moon were
  not in the latter class, he was certainly not in the first. An air of
  superiority clothed him. Among such fellows as these, he seemed a giant. When
  the thought of his crimes obtruded, might she not be tempted to a greater
  pity than condemnation? Hitherto he had struck no one of hers. Her father was
  still safe. And as to what he had done in the rest of the world, were not all
  women full of forgiveness for handsome, smooth-tongued rascals?</p>

  <p>Sick at heart, finally he turned away and stepped out into the darkness of
  the trees. This, then, was the reward of service!</p>

  <p>Ronicky could gladly have walked on through the forest and the night, and
  left it all behind him. What had happened to Jerry Dawn? What had become of
  her trust in him, her enthusiastic admiration? Now she seemed to regard the
  outlaw chief, terrible Jack Moon, as a friend!</p>

  <p>If that were her attitude, was it not better to shake the whole matter
  from his attention and let Hugh Dawn and his daughter solve their own
  problem? One thing held him, and that a potent chain&mdash;his word passed to
  Dawn to see him through the trouble.</p>

  <p>Accordingly he came back and entered the clearing. Things were rapidly
  settling down for the night, since most of the men were worn out by the
  labors of the day. Half a dozen were already preparing their bunks in the
  shacks. Moon stood in front of the little hut which had been reserved for
  Jerry Dawn, and he was talking with the girl before she went in to sleep. Her
  father sat entirely alone&mdash;but watched by how many wolfish
  eyes!&mdash;near the fire.</p>

  <p>Ronicky went straight to him and sat down at his side.</p>

  <p>"Hugh," he said, "what's come over Jerry? Has she lost her head? Has she
  gone mad, talking to Moon like that? Look at 'em over there! You'd think he
  wasn't himself. You'd think he wasn't planning to get your scalp if he can!
  You'd think he was an old family friend or a suitor, or something like
  that!"</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn did not turn his head. But he smiled sorrowfully at the younger
  man.</p>

  <p>"It's Moon getting in his work," he said. "You can't beat Jack Moon! No
  way of doing it!"</p>

  <p>"That's foolish talk! Anybody can be beaten!"</p>

  <p>"Can they? Well, maybe. I don't pretend to know everything."</p>

  <p>"Moon has the strength of twelve men behind him. Thirteen to two is the
  odds against us. Little more than six to one is hard odds, but it's been beat
  before."</p>

  <p>"He's got more than that on his side, son. He's got our weaknesses."</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone, after all, was very young, very impetuous, and not
  extremely thoughtful. "I don't follow that," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"I'll show you," said Hugh. "What's your weakness and Jerry's weakness,
  far as Jack's concerned? Your honor. Your word's good, and so's hers. He's
  made you promise something&mdash;I don't know what. Anyway, he's brought you
  in here, and he's keeping you. And he's got Jerry to promise not to try to
  run away."</p>

  <p>"But what could he do if she did run away? What could I do? How can we
  bring help? The minute outsiders come, Moon would put a bullet through your
  head. She knows it; I know it."</p>

  <p>"Sure. Maybe that's what Moon's worked on. Anyway, he's done it. He's
  tying your hands with your weaknesses."</p>

  <p>"But Moon's own word is good as gold. You told me so yourself."</p>

  <p>"Sure it is. Because his price has never been bid."</p>

  <p>"But doesn't Jerry realize what you understand&mdash;that though I seem to
  be down here as one of Moon's men&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped, realizing that his promise to Moon kept him from
  explaining.</p>

  <p>"She ain't the reasoning kind," said the older man. "She jumps to a
  conclusion the way a hoss jumps a fence into a new pasture. All she knows is
  that you're here, and that you seem to be one of Moon's men."</p>

  <p>"But she talks to Moon like a friend, yet she sure knows that he's a
  murderer a hundred times over!"</p>

  <p>"She's never seen him do a murder. And the things that count with women
  are the things they've seen. They're a practical lot, and you can lay to
  that. She thought Moon was a skunk at first. That was because she liked you.
  Now she thinks you're one of Moon's men, and so you're worse than Moon. How
  Jack got you, I don't ask. You're here and that's the main point."</p>

  <p>"But, man, will you put in a word with her for me?"</p>

  <p>"It's no good. Moon's got her all trained against you." It was strange to
  see the big fellow surrender so entirely to the very presence of the outlaw
  chief. All hope seemed to have left.</p>

  <p>"It'll come out right in the end," insisted Ronicky. "You have his word
  that if the gold's found, you go free."</p>

  <p>"His word? He'll find a way to keep me. Think he'll give me up, knowing
  that when I leave Jerry goes with me and he sees the last of her?"</p>

  <p>Ronicky gasped.</p>

  <p>"You think he wants to&mdash;to marry her?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno. I've never known him to waste time on a girl before. Jerry's the
  first."</p>

  <p>Sweat stood out on the forehead of Ronicky. At last he muttered: "Anyway,
  you're safe as long's she's with you here!"</p>

  <p>"Safe?" Hugh Dawn laughed without mirth. "You wait and see. A gun'll go
  off by accident, in the end&mdash;or a rock'll roll down a hill as I'm
  walking beneath it. That's the way it'll happen."</p>

  <p>"Then," cried Ronicky, "let's you and me pull out guns and grab the girl
  and make a break for it! Are you going to stay and get murdered?"</p>

  <p>"No use," and Hugh Dawn sighed. "I'm watched. I couldn't run a step
  without getting dropped. Same way with you. You can't beat Jack
Moon!"</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18">XVIII. GOLD!</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The little camp awakened to a swirl of activity in the
morning. Whatever
  were the problems of Dawn and Ronicky, the rest of the crowd was interested
  in gold. Gold had haunted their dreams. Gold wakened them in the first gray
  of dawn. Gold drove them through a hasty breakfast, and for the sake of gold
  their picks and shovels were deep in the dirt in the hollow well before
  sunrise.</p>

  <p>Their united efforts had rolled away the boulders which were scattered
  over the surface of the designated spot. Below, they found a soft soil, and
  the hole sank rapidly. Five feet down, however, they struck a dense layer of
  clay, which had to be chewed out bit by bit with picks.</p>

  <p>The laborers paused, growling, but Jack Moon himself leaped down into the
  pit and caught up a pick. The others now fell to with a will, and an hour of
  terrific labor pierced the clay and let them down again into gravel and
  sand.</p>

  <p>They had driven through the depth of the mound which the landslide had
  tumbled over the place, when the sun rose red through the eastern trees, and
  now, warming to the work, they pushed the hole deeper and deeper.</p>

  <p>Learning from the experience of the first pit, they made the excavation
  this second time much wider at the top and sank it in two steps, from each of
  which, when the bottom was reached, they could pass the soil in relays to the
  surface. By noon they were down a full fifteen feet below the true surface of
  the ground, and now the entire crowd was at work at the same time. The pace
  was slower than when they worked in shifts, but the progress downward was
  more steady, a continuous stream of sand and gravel pouring over the lip of
  the pit as it was deepened below.</p>

  <p>Two men brought down provisions for a quick lunch, and in ten minutes the
  work was resumed. For there was great need of haste. Never before had the
  band of Jack Moon been retained so long in one place. The long immunity which
  Moon and his followers had enjoyed was indubitably owing to the swiftness
  with which they gathered, worked, and dispersed, each man to a separate
  quarter. One day together was comparatively safe. Two became rash. And to
  spend three days together was actually putting one's head in the noose. This
  being the third day of their assemblage, and the second they had camped on
  one spot, there was not only love of gold but fear of death to spur them
  on.</p>

  <p>Midafternoon saw them down to twenty feet; but now they were working
  through a dense stratum, and the progress was slow. Besides, the whole crowd,
  from Hugh Dawn to Ronicky, was exhausted.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there was a yell from little Bud Kent as he jerked something from
  the ground with his shovel. He had pried up an ancient pick, and now he
  raised it above his head, the iron a mass of black rust, and the haft sadly
  decayed. But it was proof positive that they were not on a blind trail. Some
  one had dug here before!</p>

  <p>Who thought of weariness now? On they went with a shout and a roar. The
  gravel and sand flew up in a ceaseless shower. A dozen backs were rising and
  falling swiftly. The pebbles chimed and rang as they whipped up from the
  polished shovel blades.</p>

  <p>It was exactly half past four when the next sensation came. They were down
  a shade more than twenty-two feet when Jack Moon, again in the pit, raised,
  without a word, poising it high on his shovel&mdash;the blackened skull of a
  man.</p>

  <p>That hideous specter cast a blanket of silence over the group, then a
  groan of disappointment. Jerry had turned away, sick.</p>

  <p>"Nothing more!" Bud Kent remarked in disgust. "Maybe old Cosslett did dig
  this hole and dug it deep; but it was only because he wanted to get this gent
  out of sight. It's a burial ground, not a treasure cache. Boys, we're
  through!"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, Bud," called Jack Moon. "Look here. There's a nice little
  hole drilled through this skull between the eyes. Took a bullet to do that,
  son. What did somebody say awhile back? That Cosslett might of had a couple
  of gents dig this hole and then shot them into it and covered the bodies up?
  Well?"</p>

  <p>That possible explanation at least gave them renewed hope. Labor began
  again. And in ten minutes they had uncovered and removed two complete
  skeletons!</p>

  <p>Still the hole sank to twenty-three feet, twenty-three and a half, twenty-
  four, twenty-four and a half! Not a word had been spoken, now, for an hour.
  Lanterns had been brought and were lighted, ready for use as the evening came
  on. And already their glow began to be as bright as the twilight.</p>

  <p>Presently from Corrigan, a big brute of a man, wielding a shovel with
  steady might, came a dull roar of excitement. The gravel flew up from his
  blade as the others in the narrow pit stood back. Then, from the three
  workers in those cramped quarters, came a single-throated wail of excitement.
  The scraping shovel had cleaned off the top of an iron-bound chest!</p>

  <p>The yelling from the bottom of the hole was redoubled by the echoes along
  the sides of the pit and raised again by the men working at the mouth. They
  crowded about it as Jack Moon, with a hoarse shout, called to those below to
  make way for him.</p>

  <p>Next instant he was down into the bottom of the pit, he wrenched a pick
  from the hands of one of the diggers, and, sinking it through the top boards
  of the chest, he tore one of them up. Below was a quantity of cloth or
  canvas. One slash of his knife divided it. Then by the light of the lanterns
  which had been lowered from the surface as far as possible, every eye at once
  caught the gleam and glitter of yellow&mdash;the unmistakable shimmer of
  gold!</p>

  <p>The heart of the girl swelled until she could hardly breathe as she waited
  for the shouts of rejoicing. But not one came. Men were trembling, wild of
  eye, but their loudest voice was a husky whisper. Only Jack Moon was speaking
  aloud, and he was ordering them to pass the stuff up to the surface. It rose
  from shaking hand to shaking hand, and up on the lip of the pit came a
  gathering heap of gold spilling at the feet of the girl. She gazed on it,
  incredulous.</p>

  <p>There was power, happiness, freedom in that growing heap of yellow. It was
  an arm to pursue and a strong hand to support. It could reward and punish. It
  could actually buy a life. How many, indeed, had already been paid down
  freely to win this same metal from the earth, to take it again from the
  rightful owners, and, last of all, to hide it?</p>

  <p>Her father, frantic with joy, clambered from the pit, kneeled by the mass,
  buried his hands in it, and then looked up to her with a maniacal laugh!
  Others were coming up. The chest had been gutted of its contents. And as fast
  as they reached the top of the ground, hand after hand, shaking with joy, was
  buried in the treasure. Then Baldy McNair broke the charm.</p>

  <p>"Get down again, boys!" he cried. "This is only the beginning. There's a
  ton of gold here. But what's that? Not seven hundred thousand dollars! There
  must be more&mdash;ten times as much&mdash;maybe twenty times as much! Who
  knows? Come down again and dig!"</p>

  <p>But the heavy voice of the leader answered him as Jack Moon climbed up
  from the pit.</p>

  <p>"Hold the lanterns out. Look down yonder," he commanded.</p>

  <p>They obeyed. The chest had been smashed to pieces by Moon and put to one
  side, and in the clear place below it they saw the wet glimmer of
  bedrock.</p>

  <p>"There's no more," explained Moon. "One dollar of gold always makes ten
  dollars' worth of talk. And there you are! You'll find no more treasure.
  That's what Cosslett put down under ground, and that's all he got. The rest
  is just talk&mdash;that I believed like a fool. But ain't this enough? Over
  six hundred thousand dollars, boys. Split that by twenty for
  example&mdash;there you have thirty-three thousand dollars apiece. Is it
  enough?"</p>

  <p>They had been promised ten times that much before. But half a million in
  talk did not equal the actuality of less than a tenth of that in sheer gold.
  On the damp pile of sand on the edge of the pit they apportioned the loot,
  with the aid of a pocket scales. There was a share for each of Moon's twelve
  men, and for the leader himself three shares. To Ronicky and Dawn went also a
  share apiece. Seventeen shares, then, were apportioned.</p>

  <p>Full darkness came while Moon still weighed and apportioned the gold with
  his scales. The dust had been hammered into small bars of every conceivable
  shape for the sake of security in handling, and now the men put their shares
  away in saddlebags or pieces of the canvas which had been used to cover the
  treasure in the chest, and some even divided the loot in small pieces and put
  it in their pockets.</p>

  <p>And so at length they started up the hill for their camp, staggering under
  their burdens, yelling and singing as they walked, for all the world like a
  procession of wild drunkards. Corrigan helped the leader bear the crushing
  burden of his own portion.</p>

  <p>On the way Moon found an opportunity to drop back to the side of Jerry
  Dawn.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry," he said softly. "I'll find a means of getting all this into
  the hands of the gent to whom it belongs&mdash;your father!"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" whispered the girl, by this time completely misled. "You mustn't
  dream of it! They'd do murder before they'd give it up. Besides, we're amply
  repaid!"</p>

  <p>"Tush!" Jack Moon smiled. "There's ways of handling these gents. And I
  know all the ways!"</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19">XIX. DOONE'S SHARE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Hunger, thirst, and food were forgotten in the excitement
that followed
  the division of the gold. Only the cursing and the fierce commands of Jack
  Moon made his followers build a big fire and prepare a hasty supper. It was
  eaten by some, uneaten by others. The shouting and singing had no end. And
  the quick, bright, covetous glances were continually traveling toward the
  stores of neighbors.</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone found Hugh and his daughter a little removed. He dropped his
  canvas bag with its precious contents of gold at the feet of Dawn.</p>

  <p>"I never would of taken it in the first place," he said simply, "except to
  get more for you. There you are and welcome, Hugh; and if I could get more
  away from 'em and give it to you, I would. It's yours by right."</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn clutched the bag, his eyes glittering.</p>

  <p>"Son," he said, "I've always swore by you. But this is just too much,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His daughter drew his hands from the canvas.</p>

  <p>"Dad!" she cried in shame. "You're not going to take it?"</p>

  <p>"It's his," said Ronicky cheerfully. "It's his&mdash;or else it lies there
  where it is. I don't want it!"</p>

  <p>"You don't want it?" echoed the girl, staring up to him.</p>

  <p>Money had always been scant and hard earned in her life. She saw this
  fellow giving her father what was the equivalent of the salary of forty years
  of school teaching, and her head turned at the mere thought of it.</p>

  <p>"I don't want it," said Ronicky firmly. "Tell you why. I don't figure a
  gent can ever get something for nothing. If you're going to get money, you
  got to work for it some way. What work have I done to get this? Nope, I don't
  want it."</p>

  <p>"You've worked as much as anyone," said Hugh Dawn, urged on by a glance of
  his daughter to refuse the money.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Ronicky, "even if I have, I don't want it. They's been too
  many lives lost over the stuff to suit me. You take my share, partner. You
  couldn't force the stuff on me. Not for a free gift!"</p>

  <p>He leaned over the older man, who sat speechless before such
  generosity.</p>

  <p>"Now's the time to begin watching, Hugh. Watch every step. And when the
  pinch comes, get your back against my back!"</p>

  <p>He straightened, turned, and was gone.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible?" breathed the girl. "Is it possible that he can mean it?
  Gave all of that to us?"</p>

  <p>"Look here!" exclaimed her father gruffly. "You've been letting Jack Moon
  poison you again' Ronicky. But I tell you straight: wild as Ronicky is, his
  heart is cleaner than the gold in that sack. A pile cleaner! And his little
  finger is worth more'n all of Jack Moon. Moon? You think he'll let me go now,
  and live up to his word? Wait and see, girl. Wait and see!"</p>

  <p>She caught her breath.</p>

  <p>"Then let's go ask him now. Ask him for liberty to start, dad!"</p>

  <p>He got to his feet unwillingly.</p>

  <p>"It's no good forcing Jack's hand," he said faintly.</p>

  <p>"I tell you," insisted the girl, "he's a better man than we dreamed. If he
  hasn't told me the truth, then there's no truth in any living man! Dad, he
  means to do all he can for us!"</p>

  <p>"That," said her father, "is what you said about Ronicky Doone. And now
  you've changed your mind."</p>

  <p>"Ronicky Doone has some purpose," she insisted. "Jack explained him. He
  means well enough. He acts on impulse. Just now he has given you gold. In ten
  minutes he may murder you to get it back again! That's his character&mdash;as
  unstable as wind!"</p>

  <p>Her father merely snorted in answer.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "I'm going to walk right up to Jack and tell him I'm
  ready to start. And you see what happens!"</p>

  <p>She followed at a distance of a few paces. And it was her wide, frightened
  eyes of which Jack Moon was aware, not the strained face of Hugh himself.</p>

  <p>"Jack," said the suppliant, "I've come to ask you to live up to the
  promise you made. I want to know when I can start home to Trainer."</p>

  <p>The answer of the leader was made instantly.</p>

  <p>"Any time you want&mdash;now, if you say the word!"</p>

  <p>It staggered Hugh more than a blunt refusal. He could merely gape at Moon,
  and the latter was conscious of the flush of happiness which overspread the
  face of the girl. It was a dangerous game he was playing, and for the sake of
  bringing that flush into her face it well might be that he was giving her up
  forever. He went on smoothly enough.</p>

  <p>"Blaze away for Trainor this minute if you want, Hugh. They's two things
  agin' it, but neither of them is me and what I want. You're free as the wind
  to start, and good luck go with you. But it's a tolerable bad trip in the
  night, riding through those mountains, and even if you got easygoing hosses
  you're apt to be plumb tired before you hit Trainor to-morrow. But they's
  another thing. Hugh"&mdash;here his voice lowered and grew gentry
  confidential&mdash;"you'd ought to get more'n one share of this stuff. Try to
  hang on. I'm going to see what can be done for you."</p>

  <p>The astonishment of Hugh Dawn was as great as though the ground had opened
  before his feet. He blinked. He tried to speak.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"I mean what I say," said Jack Moon, smiling. "If you're in doubt, just
  ask your daughter. I've told her everything. Now go back to your shack and go
  to sleep. Main reason being because you need rest, and I aim to get you on
  your way before sunup. No use letting the rest of the crowd know that you've
  slipped away. I may decide to tell 'em that you've just given us the slip.
  But if you want to go now, start&mdash;and I'll see that they ain't a hand
  raised to stop you!"</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn hesitated, then nodded. The dominant tone of the outlaw
  overwhelmed him.</p>

  <p>"You're mostly always right," he admitted, "though it sure strikes me dumb
  having you thinking on my side of things like this!"</p>

  <p>The hand of Moon fell gently on the shoulder of his old follower.</p>

  <p>"Partner," he said, "I've been thinking on your side ever since I saw your
  girl. The father of a girl like that is all right!"</p>

  <p>He had allowed his voice to swell as though in the stress of his honest
  emotion, and from the corner of his eye he studied the effect of his words
  upon the girl. He was amply rewarded by the shining of her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to throw a scare into you, Hugh. I sure wanted to do that. But I
  never meant to do any more&mdash;after I seen you and the girl together at
  Cosslett's the other night. Before that I figured you were no good, you see?
  Just a traitor to me and the crowd and your word of honor. Afterward I seen
  why you had to leave us, and I didn't much blame you. With a daughter like
  that to take care of, you'd of been a no-good skunk to of stayed with me. Go
  back to your shack now, Hugh. Have a sleep. I'll tend to all the rest!"</p>

  <p>He struck him lightly and reassuringly on the shoulder as he spoke, and
  Hugh Dawn flushed with gratitude. After all, his was a hearty nature, and the
  reaction from his long suspicion of Moon was sudden and violent.</p>

  <p>"Jack," he said, in an uneven voice, "I been thinking a lot of hard
  thoughts about you. I been telling the girl she was a fool to believe you,
  but I see that you're straight, after all. No matter what you've done to
  others, you're playing a white game with me, and if a pinch ever comes later
  on when I can help you, lay to it that I'm your man!"</p>

  <p>He shook hands strongly with Moon and turned away.</p>

  <p>His daughter swung in beside him with tears bright in her eyes. "I told
  you," she was saying. "He's a good man at heart, dad, just as I said he
  was!"</p>

  <p>"He's been changed," muttered her father, with great emotion, "and it's
  you that's done the changing; almost by his account you are, Jerry. And
  Heaven bless you for it. It's the smile of your mother that you've got.
  Jerry. And that's what's saved me this time from a dog's death!"</p>

  <p>He had picked up his own gold and the share which Ronicky had given him,
  and under that great weight he walked with slow, short steps toward the shack
  in which he had spent the preceding night. From the door, where he deposited
  it, he and Geraldine looked back at the party around the camp fire.</p>

  <p>It had been growing wilder and noisier during the past hour. The camp fire
  had been built up to a comfortable height, so that the heat of it carried
  even to the shack where the girl and her father stood. It threw, also, a
  terrible and living light on the faces of the band of Jack Moon where they
  sat in groups of four, playing cards. Three groups of four, and on the table
  before each player was a glittering little pile of yellow metal. Usually
  gambling was a silent and serious effort, but tonight, with raw gold for the
  stakes, they played like madmen, shouting and calling from table to table.
  Pounds of gold were wagered on a single hand, and the loser laughed at his
  losses. For they had seen a fortune taken out of mother earth that day, and,
  if this were gone, might there not be another horde some place, discoverable
  by such lucky fellows as those who followed that prince of leaders, Jack
  Moon? Such, at least, seemed to be their spirit as they played poker. The
  unshaven faces grew more and more animal-like as, from the distance, the
  firelight seemed redder and the shadows blacker than ever.</p>

  <p>"They're terrible men," said the girl. "Ah, dad, what if Jack Moon should
  lose control of them!"</p>

  <p>"Him?" The father chuckled confidently. "He'll never lose control. Little
  you know Jack Moon, girl, if you think that any dozen men can get the upper
  hand of him!"</p>

  <p>"But suppose some of them should lose a great deal and remember that you
  have money and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Long as Moon is on our side, we're safe as though we had a thousand. Stop
  worrying. Go to sleep&mdash;and trust in Jack Moon. Fear him when he's agin'
  you; but trust him like a rock when he's behind you. No, sir, no dozen men
  can handle him. But if it come to a pinch&mdash;I dunno; yonder may be a man
  that'd give him a hard rub!"</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"Close to that pine."</p>

  <p>He pointed again, and she made out the form of Ronicky Doone where he
  stood with his arms folded across his chest, looking on at the games.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't play," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"He's smelling trouble," said her father, "and that's why he's keeping his
  nerves steady. If him and the chief meet up, then'll come the big noise and
  the big trouble, girl. You lay to that! One nacheral fighting man is worse'n
  a hundred common ones to handle!"</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap20"
     name="chap20">XX. BEATEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">As Hugh Dawn disappeared inside his shack, Jerry strolled
slowly toward
  her own hut. She recalled the man who had brought her and her father safely
  from the house when Moon and his band stole toward it. She recalled the keen
  face of Ronicky when they worked over the puzzling record through which
  Cosslett had left trace of his buried treasure. Swift of hand, steady of eye,
  resourceful of brain&mdash;after all, her father might be right, and in the
  slender figure of Ronicky there might be locked sufficient power to match the
  big body and the strong brain of Jack Moon. What the eyes told her was simply
  an overwhelming contrast; what the memory told her equaled the scales to some
  extent. But how could her father speak of Ronicky and Moon as though they
  were antagonists, when Ronicky was now, it seemed, a member of Moon's own
  band? Did he mean that the two might battle for supremacy inside the
  band?</p>

  <p>She swerved directly so as to pass close to Ronicky Doone, and she noted
  that he paid not the slightest heed to her. At that, she paused. He had
  admired her before, she knew. Perhaps it might have been more than
  admiration, but now he looked past her into thin space.</p>

  <p>"Ronicky!" she murmured, as she paused near him.</p>

  <p>His glance turned upon her swiftly, and he nodded; but then his eyes
  traveled past her again and toward those groups of gamblers, flashing from
  face to face as though he found the twelve an intricate and dangerous study.
  Why was that? she wondered.</p>

  <p>"I've come to tell you, Ronicky," she went on, "that our troubles are
  ended. Jack Moon is going to let dad leave in the morning. In fact, we can
  leave now, if we wish!"</p>

  <p>"You can?" cried Ronicky, in such a tone of amazement that she stared at
  him. "Then&mdash;then how quick can you get going?"</p>

  <p>"But we're not going to go until the morning."</p>

  <p>Ronicky sighed. "I thought not," he muttered. "I s'pose Moon told you it'd
  be better to wait till there was some light on the trails over the mountains.
  He's deep!"</p>

  <p>"You hate him blindly," insisted the girl. "But that isn't the point. In
  the morning I may leave without having a chance to see you again. Now that
  you've taken up this terrible life, I suppose I'll never see you again after
  tomorrow!"</p>

  <p>"I sure take it kind," said Ronicky, but his voice was cold, "that you've
  wasted any time thinking about that."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Ronicky," cried the girl, "I know you're close to hating me for
  things I've said to you in the last few days, but it's always been because it
  hurt me to see you go the way you've gone. But to the end of my life,
  Ronicky, I'll keep hold on my first impression of you, generous and brave,
  and kinder than any man who has ever come into my life. I want you to know
  this before I see you for the last time!"</p>

  <p>To her surprise, the tribute merely made him smile, and there was no
  gentleness in his face.</p>

  <p>"You ain't seeing me for the last time," he declared. "And&mdash;Heaven
  willing&mdash;tomorrow ain't going to be the last day, either. Jack Moon'll
  see to that."</p>

  <p>"You think he doesn't mean what he's promised? That he'll keep us after
  all?"</p>

  <p>Ronicky merely smiled. And she was angered again.</p>

  <p>"You hate him," she said fiercely, "merely because you know that he sees
  through you; and that&mdash;that's contemptible! I came here to tell you how
  sorry I am that you've gone the way you are going&mdash;but now I only have
  to say that I scorn your suspicions&mdash;and I scorn you!"</p>

  <p>But as she turned away she saw that he still was paying no heed to her but
  kept his eager, intent gaze fixed upon the gamblers.</p>

  <p>The ending of that interview had been marked by Jack Moon, and when he saw
  the girl toss her head and turn away he smiled with satisfaction. It meant
  that his most daring scheme had met with perfect success. Only by using
  Ronicky Doone as a foil had he been able to worm his way into the confidence
  of the girl. Now he was on the high road to success. That road was a
  difficult and long one to travel, even now. But much might be done with
  caution and steady diplomacy. Great problems still confronted him. Hugh Dawn
  must be disposed of. And terrible Ronicky Doone must be brushed from the way.
  Most difficult of all, the girl must listen to him when he decided to talk as
  he had never yet talked to any human being.</p>

  <p>There would be time for these things. Meanwhile, the last few minutes had
  brought about a state of affairs for which he had been watching and
  waiting.</p>

  <p>The gambling had ceased to be a gay and noisy affair. The exuberance of
  spirits which naturally followed the finding of the gold had gradually died
  away, and the silence of the gaming hall now brooded over the little groups,
  each squatted cross-legged about saddle blankets. The winner now dragged in
  his stakes with a glint of the eye. The loser saw his gold go with a savage
  out- thrust of the lower jaw.</p>

  <p>The losers were more numerous than the winners. Silas Treat had almost
  cleaned out the entire stakes of his own group. Baldy McNair had well nigh
  emptied the pockets at another blanket. Indeed, in each group there gradually
  came to be one corner toward which there was a steady drifting of profits.
  There was a natural reason. The best gamblers had avoided one another's
  company, and each had selected a place where he would have a chance for
  uninterrupted fleecing.</p>

  <p>In only one place had things gone amiss, and that was with the most expert
  gambler of all, Bud Kent. The little bow-legged, broad-shouldered fellow
  ordinarily was a steady winner, and this night he saw a chance to win, at his
  own blanket, a hundred thousand dollars in better than cash. So, with
  glinting eyes, he had settled to his task. But fate, called luck among
  gamblers, was against him. His three of a kind was invariably topped by a
  higher three. And once a flush was beaten by a higher flush! When he bluffed,
  someone was sure to call him. When he nursed the betting cautiously in the
  beginning to keep from betraying the real strength of his hand, someone was
  sure to call him, and his winnings were paltry. And at length, plunging his
  last four pounds of metal on a full house, he lost his final scrap of the
  treasure and rose from the blanket &mdash;broke!</p>

  <p>Not a word, not a glance followed him. The remaining three shifted their
  places a little and closed the gap which he had left, as well-drilled
  soldiers close the gap where a comrade falls in the charge. Each of the three
  had shared in the plundering of Bud; each of the three was confident he could
  keep on winning from his companions. But Kent went gloomily to the
  leader.</p>

  <p>"You seen that?" he said, in a deep voice of disgust.</p>

  <p>"I seen it." The chief nodded.</p>

  <p>"Can you beat it?"</p>

  <p>"Hard luck," said Jack Moon, who knew perfectly what was coming.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," went on Bud Kent, "there lies a hundred thousand in gold, and
  if I hadn't hit that last streak of bad luck I'd of cleaned the whole thing
  up. Eh?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe you would," said the leader.</p>

  <p>"Maybe? I'd of been sure to! Ain't I played with all these gents time and
  again and always trimmed them? They can't sit in the same game with me. Only
  the luck held steady for them and steady against me. But a couple more hands
  would of changed things. Luck? I never seen it hold like this! See that brace
  of bullets and the three nines I held? And four measly deuces come out and
  beat me!"</p>

  <p>He groaned at the thought.</p>

  <p>"If you was to back me," he said suddenly, "I could clean out the whole
  mess. If you was to back me, I'd split the winnings with you, Jack."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Jack Moon soberly.</p>

  <p>"I'd make it two parts for you and one part for me," persisted Bud
  Kent.</p>

  <p>"I can't do it, Bud," said Moon as kindly as possible. "You know how it is
  with me. If I backed you, then the next fellow who went busted would come and
  ask me to back him. And then the next and the next. Of course you and me know
  that it's different with you. We know that you sure can gamble. But the other
  boys wouldn't see it that way. They'd think that because I backed you I ought
  to back them. They'd accuse me of playing favorites. That's clear, ain't it,
  Bud?"</p>

  <p>"But you wouldn't have to say anything," suggested Bud. "Just slip me a
  handful of the stuff and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They'd know where you got it. Nobody but me would stake any of the boys.
  If you think I'm wrong, go around to some of the other blankets and ask some
  of the fellows for a handout. See what you get!"</p>

  <p>"I know," grunted Bud Kent, and he rolled his eyes savagely at his former
  companions. "I'll make 'em pay sooner or later," he declared. "The swine! Not
  a one in the crowd that'll stake me!"</p>

  <p>"What about Hugh Dawn?" suggested the leader.</p>

  <p>Bud Kent looked up at him sharply. But Jack Moon, having dropped his
  sinister suggestion, was staring idly up to the dark of the sky.</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap21"
     name="chap21">XXI. MOON IS BAFFLED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The silence continued through a breathless moment.</p>

  <p>"D'you mean it?" gasped Bud Kent at last.</p>

  <p>"Mean what?" said Jack Moon, and his eye was innocent as the eye of a
  child.</p>

  <p>Bud Kent considered his master. The moods of Jack Moon, he knew, were
  variable as the moods of the west wind. Other members of the crowd strove,
  from time to time, to find the meanings hidden in that implacable and cunning
  mind, but Bud Kent, the oldest member of the crew, had ceased striving to
  find the clue to the riddle. What Moon thought was his own property, and it
  was dangerous to attempt to read two meanings into his words. But now Bud
  scanned the face of the master and hungered for knowledge. What was the
  significance of that short phrase of a moment ago?</p>

  <p>"You think," said Bud at length, very slowly and very cautiously, "that
  Hugh ain't got much use for his money?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno," said the leader, as carelessly as ever. "I ain't asked him
  about it."</p>

  <p>"It might take a lot of persuading," said Bud Kent, "and I ain't much at
  talk."</p>

  <p>"Sure you ain't," said the other. "So you better arrange it so's there
  won't be no need for chatter."</p>

  <p>Bud Kent moistened his Ups, parted them to speak, changed his mind, and
  finally managed to whisper: "Chief, talk out. I don't foller you
  exactly."</p>

  <p>"How to stop talk?" replied the leader casually. "Any fool knows that.
  What mostly keeps a gent from talking?"</p>

  <p>"Being persuaded, I guess."</p>

  <p>"Think you can persuade a man out of thirty thousand dollars?"</p>

  <p>Bud swallowed hard.</p>

  <p>"I dunno," he said desperately. "You might stop a gent by gagging
  him."</p>

  <p>He grinned, so that this last suggestion might pass in lieu of a jest if
  need be. But Jack Moon kept an entirely sober face. All the time he was
  watching the effect on Bud Kent. He was as interested as the scientist who
  watches the insect wriggle under the touch of acid.</p>

  <p>"Gagging?" said he. "That's a fool idea."</p>

  <p>"What is your idea?" asked Bud.</p>

  <p>"Look here. I had to promise Dawn his share before I could find out where
  the gold was, didn't I? And then I gave him the gold, didn't I?"</p>

  <p>"Sure."</p>

  <p>"But I ain't his guardian, am I? After giving the stuff to him, I don't
  have to stay up all night to guard it, do I?"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" breathed Bud, beginning to see the light.</p>

  <p>"It sure ought to be clear to you, Bud, that it don't make me any too
  happy to see a skunk like Dawn, that's left the crowd once, get away with all
  that loot."</p>

  <p>"That's clear, chief."</p>

  <p>"Then, if a gent was to slip in soft to Hugh's hut and grab the
  coin&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With three other men sleeping around him?"</p>

  <p>"I'll see that he sleeps alone tonight. They ain't any need of guarding
  him. He thinks he's extra safe with us now!"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" murmured Bud.</p>

  <p>"What you want is a stake," went on Jack Moon. "Tonight ain't the only
  night for poker. They'll be another and then another, until the gold is all
  collected up in the hands of two or three of the boys. Well, Bud, you're soft
  moving and silent. If you was to slide in and take the stuff, it wouldn't
  make me extra mad. But mind this: They's no harm to come to Hugh Dawn!"</p>

  <p>Bud Kent replied with a broad grin, nodded, and then said suddenly: "But
  suppose he makes a kick about his money in the morning when he finds it's
  gone? Suppose they search for it and find it in my saddlebags?"</p>

  <p>"If you're enough of a fool not to bury it, son, I suppose they would find
  it in your saddlebags."</p>

  <p>Bud Kent waited to hear no more, but, nodding to his chief with a
  whispered word of gratitude, he sauntered back to watch the game he had just
  left.</p>

  <p>On and on to midnight the game continued, but by this time the terrific
  labors of the last two days began to tell. The gold fever was dying out, and,
  without this stimulant to keep them going, heads began to nod and eyes began
  to grow filmy. Seymour and Craig by this time were also broke; they joined
  Bud Kent as a gallery to watch the others. But at length, by mutual consent
  and almost at the same moment, the games were broken up and the gamblers
  staggered hollow-eyed toward their shacks. Here Jack Moon, who had been
  waiting for this moment, assigned them swiftly to their separate lodgings. He
  kept his promise to Bud, steering the others away from the hut of Dawn. The
  pretext was easily found&mdash;no use waking up a sleeper when there was
  plenty of room in other huts. One shack for the girl, one for her father, and
  the other structures afforded room for thrice the whole number of men.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Ronicky waited until the leader was out of sight. Then he
  glanced about the clearing. Other than himself, every man in the crowd was
  busy with getting into his blankets&mdash;all except the two outposts
  detailed to keep watch south and north, unfailing precautions which the
  bandit chief never overlooked. But the clearing itself was the very
  apotheosis of peace. Not a voice sounded, not a footfall was to be heard. All
  was dull quiet, and Ronicky turned his back on the scene, entered the hut,
  and straightened out his own blanket.</p>

  <p>One by one the breathing of the men in the hut became more deep and
  regular. He himself imitated the same sound and lay back, veiling his eyes
  with the lids and only peering out through the curtain of lashes. The silence
  grew more and more deep, it seemed to him. The heavier sound of Treat's
  breathing sounded above the hushed chorus of the others. Someone was snoring
  in a nearby hut. But beyond and above was the silence.</p>

  <p>It was, indeed, too quiet. It was the quiet of a snare, an illusion, a
  trap. And one of those impulses, which no man can really explain, came to
  Ronicky. An hour had passed since he lay down, and still sleep was far from
  his eyes. At length, with the softness of a guilty man who dreads oversight,
  he drew back his blanket and sat up. Finally he rose to a crouching position,
  stole to the door, and looked out onto the clearing.</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap22"
     name="chap22">XXII. TWO AGAINST TWELVE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">He saw nothing at first, and he was about to dismiss his
foolish fears
  when something stirred near the hut in which the girl slept. Ronicky Doone
  was instantly alert. Staring fixedly, he saw the thing again.</p>

  <p>It was the form of a man crawling in an almost prone position so that the
  ground shadows well nigh covered him from the most searching view. Suspicion
  had been like a searchlight to pick out the figure for Ronicky Doone.
  Ordinarily, he would never have seen it.</p>

  <p>The fellow, whoever he might be, had just crawled out of sight behind the
  shack of the girl. Ronicky slid back to his blankets, buckled his cartridge
  belt about him, and, blessing the fact that he had no riding boots to
  encumber his stockinged feet, he stole again to the door, prepared to stalk
  toward the hut of Jerry Dawn.</p>

  <p>But as he reached the door again, the figure reappeared on the nearer side
  of the girl's hut and crawled on until it passed behind the next shack, that
  where Hugh Dawn slept, and, though Ronicky waited an ample time, the stalker
  did not reappear. Then suddenly it flashed across the mind of the watcher
  that Hugh Dawn slept alone in that shack this night! Was there some ulterior
  purpose in the kindly insistence of Moon that Hugh be allowed to sleep on,
  undisturbed by the coming of others in his shack?</p>

  <p>Ronicky did not pause to dissect possibilities. That was not his habit. He
  was instantly out of the door and going across the clearing at a stealthy
  pace.</p>

  <p>Was it Moon himself who wandered about the camp and spied on Hugh Dawn,
  fearful lest the man steal away with his share of the gold during the
  night?</p>

  <p>Another moment and Ronicky was crouched just under the wall of the cabin.
  Slowly, inch by inch&mdash;how painful was the movement!&mdash;he raised his
  head and looked into the interior of the shack from the window at the side of
  the building.</p>

  <p>He was right. The stalker had aimed at entering the shack of Dawn, for the
  back door of the little house was still ajar, and standing framed in it was
  the figure of the intruder. Hugh Dawn himself lay near the wall, his right
  arm thrown loosely about the sack which contained his share of Cosslett's
  plunder.</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone drew his revolver and waited.</p>

  <p>The progress of the thief, if that were indeed his purpose, was infinitely
  slow. His forward glide was hardly faster than the steady drifting of the
  second hand around the dial of a watch. Presently, he leaned above the
  sleeper and laid hold on the canvas bag. With a cautious slowness he began to
  lift the burden.</p>

  <p>The straining eyes of Ronicky now enabled him to see more details. When
  the bag began to be moved, for instance, he saw the hand of Dawn stir, and as
  it stirred a bright bit of steel was raised and poised in the hand of the
  thief. Now the bag, however, was safely drawn above the encircling arm of
  Dawn.</p>

  <p>It was the gold itself which betrayed the thief. For as he came on his
  feet with that burden, the rotten old boards which floored the shack gave
  under him, and there was a faint squeak as board rubbed against board.</p>

  <p>Instantly the sleeper wakened with a gasp that promised to be his last,
  for the knife flashed up in the hand of the thief. No mistaking that motion.
  He meant to strike, and he meant to strike home. Ronicky Doone fired.</p>

  <p>When he leaped around the corner of the house and sprang through the door,
  he saw Hugh Dawn standing with a revolver in each hand, while a still form
  lay on the floor before him. Those two guns jumped up and were leveled
  against Ronicky.</p>

  <p>"Don't shoot!" cried Ronicky. "Light your lantern. Quick, Hugh! Is it
  Moon?"</p>

  <p>And all his heart rose up in hope that it might indeed be the master
  criminal.</p>

  <p>"You, Ronicky?" breathed Dawn. "I might of knowed you'd be the one to keep
  watch over me tonight when I trusted to Moon's word, like a fool, and figured
  myself safe. Here's a light. I seen the knife drop in his hand when you shot.
  Fifth part of another second, and I'd be where he is now!"</p>

  <p>His trembling hands ignited a lantern, and as the smoking flame rose
  Ronicky turned the dead man upon his back. They both looked down into the
  sullen, relaxed features of Bud Kent. The bullet had struck him in the back
  of the head and came out again squarely between the eyes, a grisly wound. In
  falling, the canvas bag had struck the floor beside the victim, and part of
  the gleaming contents had tumbled beside him. If ever gold had killed a man,
  here was a sample! Ronicky turned to Hugh Dawn, the latter trembling from the
  narrowness of his escape.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said, "we're in for thunder and battle, Dawn. Guard the house,
  I'm going to try to get Jerry in here, or otherwise the swine Moon
  will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped, for the sound of clamoring voices broke in upon him. Then
  there was a rush of running feet and shouting across the clearing and the
  well- known bass thunder of Jack Moon's voice calling: "Steady, boys, and get
  back here. I'll do the exploring!"</p>

  <p>Ronicky jumped to the front door.</p>

  <p>Every man of the band was out in the clearing, and guns gleamed in every
  hand. Jack Moon was striding toward the shack at a long-gaited run. It was
  too late to reach Jerry Dawn unless she would come at his call.</p>

  <p>"Jerry!" he shouted. "Jerry Dawn!"</p>

  <p>And he halted Moon with a clear-ringing warning: "Get back, Moon, or I'll
  drill you through!"</p>

  <p>The bandit stopped as the frightened face of Jerry appeared at the door of
  her shack.</p>

  <p>"Jerry!" called Ronicky Doone. "Come here, quick! Don't stop for
  nothing!"</p>

  <p>"Si!" shouted Moon in counter warning. "Get the girl and keep her from
  that throat-cutter. Jerry, if you trust Ronicky, you trust a man that's just
  done murder!"</p>

  <p>That word was decisive. She shrank back from the door with a cry of
  terror, and at the same time Silas Treat, who had apparently been running up
  from the other side of the shack, out of sight of Ronicky, swerved into view
  for a moment and then sprang into the shack with the girl. Taken by surprise
  though he was, Ronicky managed to get in a shot, but his aim was so hurried
  that, even at that short distance, he missed. He was only able to knock the
  hat from the head of the big man, and the wide sombrero fluttered clumsily
  toward the ground.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the rest of the band in the clearing had dived for cover,
  and as they did so they sent a volley which crashed into the solid log walls
  of the hut about the doorway where Ronicky stood. He himself took to cover,
  calling to Hugh Dawn to turn down the flame of the lantern so as to give the
  enemy a dimmer target.</p>

  <p>An instant of silence settled over the battlefield. In that breathing
  space Ronicky turned to his older companion and found Dawn cool and steady as
  a rock. The time had come for action now, and the big fellow was ready. He
  had now taken his post in the corner of the shack, covering, in that fashion,
  both the rear door and the single window to the east, facing the hut which
  now contained his daughter and Silas Treat.</p>

  <p>"Get out of line!" warned Ronicky hastily. "Get out of line, Hugh! They'll
  be trying pot shots at the window and at the door pretty pronto."</p>

  <p>The other nodded and stepped back. And then they heard the wailing voice
  of Jerry Dawn crying: "Dad! Oh, dad! Are you there? Are you safe?"</p>

  <p>He roared the answer: "Safe and sound, girl, thanks to Ronicky Doone!
  Murder they can call it if they will, but it was Bud Kent or me. Ronicky
  dropped Bud in time to save my neck. Watch yourself, Jerry, and come to us
  when you can! You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A shouting rose in the clearing, and then a crackle of guns, which Ronicky
  shrewdly guessed was more to drown the sound of Hugh's voice than in the hope
  of dropping one of the two.</p>

  <p>Then came a frightened cry: "Dad! Help!"</p>

  <p>But it was Ronicky Doone who responded to that call.</p>

  <p>"They're taking her away from the shack!" he cried to Dawn. "The
  dogs!"</p>

  <p>He started for the door with a fierce murmur, like that of a bull terrier
  before it springs at the throat of an enemy. Hugh Dawn hurled himself after
  his companion and gathered the smaller man into the huge embrace of his arms,
  where Ronicky strove vainly to worm his way toward liberty, writhing and
  twisting and panting.</p>

  <p>"Let me go, Hugh!" he shouted. "Let me get at em!"</p>

  <p>"You fool!" gasped Dawn. "Don't you know that the minute you show your
  head it'll be loaded with bullets? And when you go, I go, too! One man can't
  hold two doors and a window. Ronicky, for both our sakes we got to play
  safe!"</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone, weak with rage and disappointment, submitted and stood
  leaning against the wall.</p>

  <p>"They've got her," he groaned. "And now they'll ride off with her, Hugh.
  They've got her and most of the money that Cosslett buried. And now&mdash;
  Heaven knows what'll happen! When I had that chance to fight Moon man to man,
  why didn't I take it?" He added sadly: "Now I've lost everything!"</p>

  <p>"She'll come to no harm in their hands," insisted the girl's father.</p>

  <p>"No harm?" said Ronicky. "They won't lay a hand on her. I know that. But
  the main danger is that Moon has a chance to talk to her, the snake! And no
  one knows what he'll be able to persuade her to!"</p>

  <p>"After he's sent a man to murder me? After he's taken her and is keeping
  her away from me by force? After he's set a siege to the cabin where I am?
  D'you think he can persuade away all those things?"</p>

  <p>"He could persuade the angels that he was one of 'em, if he had a chance,"
  said Ronicky gloomily. "Hush! There's the devil himself calling to us."</p>

  <p>"Doone! Ronicky Doone!" called the voice of Jack Moon.</p>

  <p>"I hear you," answered Ronicky. "Talk out, Moon."</p>

  <p>"Do I get a truce?" said Moon. "If I come out to talk to you, Ronicky,
  will you and Hugh promise to gimme a chance to get back safe? I want to tell
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come out," said Ronicky. "You know I won't plug you. I wish I was the
  kind that would take an advantage. But I ain't your brand of man, Jack
  Moon!"</p>

  <p>Without waiting for a further assurance, Jack Moon appeared across the
  clearing at the door of the shack facing that of Ronicky and Hugh. He
  advanced until he was three paces from Ronicky, who remained in the shadow at
  the door.</p>

  <p>"Stop there!" commanded Ronicky. "That's close enough for talk."</p>

  <p>"If you don't trust me," said Moon, "right enough! But here I am one man
  against two, and yet you're afraid."</p>

  <p>Ronicky answered indirectly.</p>

  <p>"Watch the back of the house, Hugh," he directed, "and watch sharp. If a
  head or a hand shows, take a potshot. They might try to rush from behind
  while Moon chats here in front. Now go on and talk, Moon. I suppose you want
  the body of Kent?"</p>

  <p>"Was it Bud Kent you murdered, Ronicky?"</p>

  <p>"Murdered? And you mean to say you didn't send him? You didn't send him to
  knife Hugh and get Hugh's share of the stuff?"</p>

  <p>"They ain't no use trying to persuade you different," said the leader
  gravely, "if you look at it that way. But use sense, Ronicky, and you'll see
  that it didn't mean anything to me to wipe Hugh out of the way! You know what
  means more to me than anything else, and that's the good opinion of Jerry.
  Would I get that if I had her father killed?"</p>

  <p>"You'd of talked her into thinking that you didn't send Kent."</p>

  <p>"And I didn't!"</p>

  <p>"You lie, Moon. I saw you talking to him."</p>

  <p>"He was asking me for money. He lost all his share, and he wanted another
  stake to gamble with. I wouldn't give him anything, and the dog came here to
  steal. Ronicky&mdash;and you, Dawn&mdash;I want you to listen to sense. The
  boys are red-hot for action. They want the scalps of both of you, and if
  they's any more resistance, they'll get your scalps! But you know the way I
  stand. I've got to get you off if I can, for the sake of the girl and what
  she'll think. Boys, if you'll come out with me and give yourselves up and
  trust me, I can get you scot-free, I think. Otherwise, you're no better'n
  dead."</p>

  <p>"I trusted you once before," said Hugh Dawn, "and near got my gullet
  opened for it. No more of that, Moon. I ain't a plumb fool!"</p>

  <p>"No use trying to argue you out of that," said Moon, "if you've got your
  mind all set that way. But you'll see how it comes out. The boys'll roast you
  out of the shack. But that's up to you. Meantime, give me Kent's body, and
  I'll take it back&mdash;and Heaven help you for what's coming!"</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn raised the dead man and gave the burden to the waiting arms of
  the leader, who now turned his back and trudged slowly away, bearing his
  grisly load.</p>

  <p>Then Dawn turned with a gray face to Ronicky. "I'd forgot the danger of
  fire," he said. "D'you think he'll use it?"</p>

  <p>"He'll use anything, if he can get at us. But we got to wait and see. How
  much water have we here?"</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn raised his canteen and shook it. There was a sound of water
  slushing inside the tin.</p>

  <p>"One quart," he said.</p>

  <p>That was their total supply.</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap23"
     name="chap23">XXIII. MOON'S SINCERITY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Covered by the forest, three men watched the hut which was
the fortress of
  Dawn and Ronicky. Eight remained to receive the leader and his burden, Bud
  Kent's body. Behind the shelter of the shacks which cut them away from the
  sight and the guns of Ronicky and Dawn, the outlaws stood in a loosely formed
  circle and stared silently down into the face of Kent. There was no
  expression of sorrow from those fierce fellows. They had seen too many
  companions drop before. But there was a universal turning of eyes to the
  direction of hidden Ronicky and his companion.</p>

  <p>Jerry Dawn, her face hidden in her hands, leaned almost fainting against a
  tree near by, with Silas Treat, her guard, close to her.</p>

  <p>"Si," ordered the commander, "take Miss Dawn away. Give her a walk through
  the trees."</p>

  <p>She submitted to Treat's touch, and they disappeared among the forest's
  shadows.</p>

  <p>"Now, boys," said Jack Moon, "you see the luck that's followed us?"</p>

  <p>A dead and ominous silence greeted his speech.</p>

  <p>"Are you set on giving the house a rush?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Why not fire?" suggested the crafty Baldy McNair.</p>

  <p>"Why not a torch and a signal fire to call everybody in the mountains this
  way?" the leader countered, with a sneer.</p>

  <p>It was something the others had not thought of. But now Baldy returned on
  a different tack.</p>

  <p>"We can get close to them in the shack that stands alongside of theirs.
  There won't have to be no forest fire. We can throw burning sticks onto the
  roof of their house and rout them out that way, and then the rest of us can
  stand by and plug them when they try to run. Ain't that simple enough?"</p>

  <p>"Mighty simple!" again Jack Moon sneered. "Too simple. The logs of that
  shack are soaked as wet as they can be from the rains of the last week. And
  there's been too much shade over the house for the rain to get all dried out
  again. Most you could do would be to start a slow fire smoldering, and we
  can't wait for a slow fire to eat into that cabin."</p>

  <p>The argument seemed unanswerable.</p>

  <p>"But," persisted McNair, "we got to do something. Otherwise, we'll be a
  laughing stock. What's mostly kept us safe all of this time? The fact that
  nobody knew our faces or what we were like. It was just known that Jack Moon
  and his band were worse than the devil, and that we couldn't be follered and
  found. But if gents get to know that we've let two men sift through our
  fingers, and if those two gents go out and give a description of what we look
  like and all that, how long d'you think we'll last? Boys, we'll be signing
  our own death warrant if we let them two go free! They got to die. And they
  got to die, even if it costs the chief the good liking of that girl
  yonder!"</p>

  <p>"Boys," said Moon, "let's do the wise thing. I ain't going to stay here
  and waste words talking and arguing with Baldy McNair about his crazy idea
  that I want the girl. I'm willing to admit that we'd ought to make a final
  try at the cabin, and we'll attempt to plug the gents that's in it.</p>

  <p>"We'll work out a way of getting at it somehow or other, and then we'll
  try to finish up Doone and Hugh. But I warn you, it ain't going to be any
  easy job. If we fail, I'm for starting back over the hills as fast as we can
  travel, carrying the girl with us, as a hostage, and then, after we get a
  little distance off, I'm for splitting up and each man going for his home.
  Does that sound like good sense to the rest of you?"</p>

  <p>They all had to admit that it was the best plan. To wait to burn wet logs
  would be foolish. It might take them two days. To attempt to lay a long siege
  to the hut which sheltered the two enemies, was even more insane. But by a
  single rush, using weight of sheer numbers, they might do much. Then, as the
  leader had suggested, the possession of the girl might prove a point of the
  utmost importance, if they failed to capture the hut; for, while she was in
  their hands during their flight, Doone and Hugh, even though they followed,
  certainly would not dare to call up the powers of the law to run down the
  outlaw band.</p>

  <p>"Baldy," said the leader, "you and the boys put your heads together and
  lay a plan. I'm going out to get Si Treat. And when I come back I'll go over
  the scheme with you. We've got to make the plan and try it out before dawn.
  By daylight we've got to be on our way north!"</p>

  <p>Yet the preparations of Jack Moon, considering the fact that he had just
  arranged for an attack, were most singular. First he slipped around to the
  rearmost hut of the three which faced the clearing on this side, opposite to
  the one in which Doone and Hugh were.</p>

  <p>Behind this shack he found in the woods the two tall grays which the girl
  and her father had ridden out onto the trail. Tall and long of limb they
  were, and in a pinch it would go hard indeed if the common cow ponies of the
  band could keep pace with the big fellows.</p>

  <p>These two horses he saddled, putting the girl's saddle upon one and his
  own upon the other. But his preparations did not stop there. From the rest of
  the horses he selected the two which combined the greatest speed and
  strength. Then, having saddled them, he packed upon them his own three shares
  of the gold, shares which he had weighed out so cunningly that in reality
  there was the weight of four, and close to a hundred thousand dollars' worth
  of the precious metal was included in the double load.</p>

  <p>Still he was not content. Slipping into the next shack, unobserved all
  this time by the grave council which was deliberating on ways and means of
  attacking the house of Ronicky, he brought forth another load of the gold,
  the share of what member of the band he could not tell. This burden he
  divided carefully between the two grays, putting more than two thirds of it
  in the saddle-bags of the girl. Before he had ended, he had given to each of
  the four horses a well-apportioned load equal in weight to a very heavy
  rider. This done, he advanced, leading the four straight into the wood,
  making what speed he could, because time was infinitely precious&mdash;five
  minutes saved now might mean four horse-loads of gold saved later on.</p>

  <p>He advanced until he was far up on the side of the hill, where he tethered
  the four horses to a tree of conspicuous size, easily located from a
  distance. Then he turned back, and after a few minutes of search he found the
  girl and Silas Treat, who, with stolid obedience, had taken her well on into
  the forest and was now keeping her in a little clearing.</p>

  <p>"Go back to the boys," said the leader to Treat, "and tell them that I'm
  going to dispose of the girl and then follow later on."</p>

  <p>"How is it that you can leave the girl off here and come back yourself?"
  asked Treat curiously.</p>

  <p>"I'll manage that," said the leader. "There are lots of ways of
  managing."</p>

  <p>"This?" queried Treat, and with a broad grin he passed his forefinger
  across his throat.</p>

  <p>It was done with such inhuman complacence that even the hard heart of Jack
  Moon revolted.</p>

  <p>"Maybe that way," he admitted, eager simply to get rid of his gigantic
  follower and be alone with the girl. "Now get back, Si, and tell the boys to
  watch sharp, because Ronicky may start a rush. That's his kind. He don't like
  inaction, and when he starts he'll do enough to keep all of you warm."</p>

  <p>Jerry had not made an effort to escape during the conversation while the
  two men had turned their backs to her. Instead, she sat on a fallen log with
  her head supported in both hands, and the leader, approaching, had time even
  in his rush of thoughts, even in his eagerness to get away, to mark the
  slenderness of the fingers against her hair.</p>

  <p>"Jerry!" he called softly.</p>

  <p>She raised her head and stared at him blankly. But even now, after all she
  had seen and heard, there was no sign of hysterical terror about her. From
  the first, when a crisis came, she had made no outcry, no noisy appeals, but
  like a man of firm nerve she had waited for events to develop before she made
  her decisions, before she moved. She was waiting still as she faced the
  outlaw, and the big man admired her from the bottom of his heart and pitied
  her for the lie which he was about to tell.</p>

  <p>"Jerry," he went on, "I've come to ask you to trust in me another
  time."</p>

  <p>Her answer was a smile, no more, but the smile was of greater import than
  a thousand words of scorn, contempt, accusation. Moon winced before her, but
  he went on as smoothly as possible: "Wait till I get through talking before
  you make up your mind. Jerry, you know my place in the world. You know how
  I've fought to gain it. You know that up here in the mountains I'm as good as
  a king, with a kingdom and followers. Well, I've decided to give it all up
  &mdash;for your sake!"</p>

  <p>He waited for that point to tell.</p>

  <p>But she said: "So you've hemmed in my father. You've set your bloodhounds
  around him. And any moment, perhaps now, your men are sneaking up to set fire
  to his hiding place and shoot him as he runs out. You've done that also for
  my sake, Jack Moon?"</p>

  <p>He wondered at her calmness, until he saw that her hands were gripped. In
  a man such calm would have preceded a fierce attack. He said: "This'll go to
  show how wrong it is for folks to make up their minds about other gents until
  they know! Now listen to what's really happened. My boys want to kill, and
  they want to kill your father. I guess you know that."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"They were so dead set against him that I didn't dare let them see you
  around while I was talking to 'em. Seeing you would of made 'em think more
  and more about Hugh and made 'em wilder and wilder to get at him. That's why
  I sent you away with Si Treat&mdash;so's I could have a chance to be alone
  with 'em and try to make 'em talk sense and see sense. Well, when you were
  gone, I tried a high hand with 'em. I knew right enough that they could burn
  out your father and Ronicky like rats out of a hole. But because of you I had
  to stop 'em. So I piled up the difficulties and made it look bad to try.
  Anyway, I made 'em change their minds, which I couldn't of done if you'd been
  there to sort of urge 'em on to get at Hugh. I made 'em promise to get away
  as soon as they could and follow after me. So they're going to stay behind me
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you and I?" queried the girl, vaguely groping toward his meaning.</p>

  <p>"And you and I, Jerry, won't be on the north road at all! We'll be driving
  west as fast as the spurs will send the hosses! Ain't it clear, and ain't it
  a beauty? There was your father and Doone no better'n dead men, and here I've
  gotten 'em off free and sound!"</p>

  <p>It was all clear to her. Suddenly she cried, with a great impulse of
  thanksgiving: "Heaven bless you for it!"</p>

  <p>"Let them bless you," said the outlaw. "Because, except for you, they'd of
  been finished sure!"</p>

  <p>"But you and I ride west, and your men ride north&mdash;Jack Moon, does it
  mean that you've broken away from them, that you never intend to ride with
  them again, that you've given up your life of crime?"</p>

  <p>"It's all according to what you want it to mean."</p>

  <p>"Ah," she murmured, "if I could only trust you for half a minute! If I
  could only be sure of the thoughts that are going on in that wild, cruel mind
  of yours! Tell me, are you speaking true?"</p>

  <p>"Can you ask that?" he said, dodging her swiftly. Then he cried with utter
  sincerity: "I'd make myself over a thousand times if one shape of me would
  get a single smile out of you, Jerry. Will you believe that?"</p>

  <p>"After what I've seen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You've seen nothing. Neither you nor anybody else has ever seen a thing!
  My real self is a buried self, girl! And they's only one thing in the world
  that can make me what I ought to be."</p>

  <p>"I think I know what you mean," she said faintly. "And&mdash;and in spite
  of myself I think you mean what you say. Otherwise, how could you dare to
  leave your men&mdash;to betray them in order to ride with me? Because, Jack
  Moon, if you have left them, if you are speaking the truth to me, there are
  some of them who will never leave your trail until they have run you down and
  killed you like a dog! You know that!"</p>

  <p>"Ay, if they could run me down. But they can't. That west road I start on
  is going to swing off to an east road before long, and you and I are
  going&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Back to Trainor?"</p>

  <p>He winced, but then he went on glibly: "We're going to follow it wherever
  you want it to be followed. But the first thing now is for you and me to get
  onto our hosses and ride as we never rode before. Will you come?"</p>

  <p>"I'll come."</p>

  <p>"And trust me?"</p>

  <p>"What else can I do?"</p>

  <p>"Then," cried the outlaw, "I've started a new life."</p>

  <p>And, for the first time in his wild life, he meant what he
said!</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap24"
     name="chap24">XXIV. PREPARATIONS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">All unconscious of the fact that their leader, so long
trusted, had at
  last betrayed them, the band of Jack Moon gathered around Silas Treat when
  the black-bearded giant strode out of the trees and stood before them.</p>

  <p>"Where's Moon?" asked one.</p>

  <p>"Back with the girl. Going to put her out of the way while we plan to
  tackle the house. I told him he'd better knife the filly. That's what he'll
  do."</p>

  <p>"You're a fool, Treat," said Baldy McNair, who took greater liberties in
  his speech and manner than any other in the band. "You're a fool and a swine.
  But the chief's right. He'll tie up the girl and leave her in the woods. No
  use having her around when we rush the house. And no use having her so near
  she can hear any yells. Has he got her far enough back so's she won't hear
  much?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty near," said Si Treat. "Back there in that little clearing up the
  hill. The trees would cut off most of the noise near the ground from this
  direction."</p>

  <p>"How long'll it take him?"</p>

  <p>"Not long, and he says for us to keep right on planning till he shows
  up."</p>

  <p>"We've made our plan. We're going to scatter and rush the shack from all
  sides at once. The old boy," Baldy went on to explain, "always figures that
  we ain't got the gumption to do anything or plan anything while he's away.
  Like as not he's lying back there in the brush and laughing to himself
  because we sit around and do nothing, with dead Bud Kent lying here to urge
  us along. Well, boys, let's up and show lack Moon that with him or without
  him we can get along. It's time he was showed that, anyway! I say, let's
  scatter. Best place to start from is the shack beside Ronicky's. Well, let's
  half of us get in there and the rest scatter out sort of promiscuous and get
  ready for the run. We'll call in the other gents that are watching now, and
  then we'll let drive. If them two in the shack ain't got nine lives apiece,
  well salt 'em away and plant 'em under ground. Are you with me?"</p>

  <p>There was a grumble of sullen acquiescence in answer, and the eight began
  to spread swiftly around the edges of the clearing, taking advantage of all
  shelter of the trees until they should be within short sprinting distance of
  the shack.</p>

  <p>That hut, in the meantime, remained as silent and as black as though the
  two men who formerly occupied it had long since taken to flight, melting
  unseen into the forest by mysterious stealth.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, they had been hard at work during most of the past
  hour. It was Ronicky who possessed the feverish urge to get out of the
  confining quarters of the shack and strive to break through the lines of the
  enemy by a surprise attack. But the sober warnings of his companion deterred
  him. As Hugh Dawn repeatedly pointed out, they were being watched all the
  time, no matter how hushed the silence around the clearing might be. They
  were being watched by eyes that squinted down the deadly length of rifle
  barrels, and if they left their shelter and the thick log walls which were
  strong enough to stop a revolver bullet at least, they would certainly go
  down before they had taken more than two steps from their place of
  refuge.</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone submitted.</p>

  <p>"But it sure galls me," he had remarked through his teeth, "to think of
  lying here and getting trapped like a rat! It sure galls me, Hugh. I'd rather
  die ten times fighting in the open than once behind the walls of a cage!"</p>

  <p>The other had nodded, and, reaching through the darkness of the shack, he
  had laid his hand on the shoulder of his young friend and pressed it with a
  reassuring firmness. Indeed, Hugh was a rock of unperturbed strength during
  the entire crisis.</p>

  <p>"We got the strong position," he kept assuring Ronicky.</p>

  <p>"But suppose they rush us? It ain't more'n a couple of jumps to that
  nearest hut."</p>

  <p>"That's right. But a gent can do a pile of shooting while somebody else is
  taking a couple of steps."</p>

  <p>"In the night?"</p>

  <p>"That makes it bad, all right. But I don't think they'll rush your guns,
  Ronicky! We might hang out the lantern after lighting it. That'd give us some
  light on one side of the house, anyway."</p>

  <p>Ronicky merely laughed at the absurdity of the suggestion.</p>

  <p>"They'd smash the lantern to bits with a couple of shots."</p>

  <p>"Didn't think of that."</p>

  <p>"How much oil is in that lantern?" asked Ronicky suddenly.</p>

  <p>"It's a big one. About a quart of oil in it, I guess."</p>

  <p>"And what's that old mattress in the corner stuffed with?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno."</p>

  <p>Ronicky crossed the floor and ripped open the small section of mattress
  which had once served on the corner bunk. An instant later he muttered a low
  exclamation of satisfaction and came back with a liberal armful of the waste
  with which the mattress had been stuffed.</p>

  <p>"Now lemme have the lantern," he suggested.</p>

  <p>It was given him, and to the astonishment of the elder man Ronicky opened
  the bottom of the tin support and thoroughly wet large portions of the waste
  with the kerosene.</p>

  <p>"And what in Sam Hill," muttered Hugh Dawn, "d'you figure to win by
  wasting all that oil, son?"</p>

  <p>"I'll show you in a minute."</p>

  <p>He continued by lighting the lantern and taking off the chimney. Then he
  turned down the wick, so that there was only a quivering tongue tip of flame
  visible.</p>

  <p>"They's enough oil," he explained, "to keep that lantern going till pretty
  near morning, if we don't bum it no faster'n that."</p>

  <p>"I don't foller you, Ronicky."</p>

  <p>"Well," explained the other, "here I put a pile of this oil-soaked stuff
  in my corner, and there I put a pile of it alongside of you. Suppose they was
  to start a rush. The first one of us that sees a move gives a yell and
  instead of shooting grabs up the waste and passes it over the lantern. The
  minute the oil comes anywhere near that flame it will bust into fire, and we
  throw the stuff out through the windows. It'll light up everything for a
  minute or two. It'll make us miss a half second that we could of used for
  shooting, but it'll also give us a chance to get in three or four aimed
  shots. I'd rather have one aimed shot than ten chance cracks at shadows."</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn, as the idea struck home to him, gasped with pleasure.</p>

  <p>"I been lying here waiting to die," he admitted. "And now I figure that we
  got a ghost of a chance to keep 'em off. Just a ghost of a chance. But,
  Ronicky, ghosts can be mighty important things!"</p>

  <p>There was another time of silence. The hour was now close to half past
  four in the morning, or thereabouts, and it was the period of greatest
  fatigue, when nervous reactions are slower, when the muscles are deadened for
  lack of sleep, and the mind is sick for weariness. And yet, once or twice at
  about this time, Ronicky heard humming.</p>

  <p>After all, happiness is a comparative thing. Hugh Dawn had felt that he
  was to be slaughtered without a chance even to fight. The fighting chance was
  now to him almost as much as the promise of complete safety to most men.
  Ronicky, listening, wondered and admired.</p>

  <p>"Suppose Jerry could look inside here and see you fighting for me,
  Ronicky. She'd have to change her mind about a couple of things, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Not while Moon is there to talk to her. He won't give her a chance to
  think. The skunk has double crossed me, Hugh. I was a fool ever to listen to
  him, but I took his word. He swore that if there was trouble coming, he'd
  never let his crowd jump me. Him and me would fight it out man to man. That's
  why I come in&mdash;like a fool, partner! But here we are, both trapped, and
  me in no position to help the way I'd be if I was loose out there among the
  trees!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe not, son. And if there was ever a square-shooter, it's you,
  Ronicky. Look!" Dawn pointed suddenly. "I seen something move behind the
  trees."</p>

  <p>"And me!" answered Ronicky. "I think I hear somebody sneaking beside the
  other shack and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he leaped up from his knees with a yell.</p>

  <p>"Hugh! They're at us!"</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap25"
     name="chap25">XXV. THE ATTACK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Ronicky had seen two low-moving shadows detach themselves
from the front
  of the neighboring shack and start toward the front of his own at full speed,
  while from the window of the hut a rifleman began blazing away at his window.
  That hurricane of bullets, one after the other, should have the effect of
  making it lively for a marksman attempting to shoot from the aperture.</p>

  <p>Ronicky scooped up a quantity of the waste and passed it over the lantern.
  Instantly the flames burst out, fed by the kerosene, and he hurled the
  armful, with the flames already sweeping back across his shirt, through the
  window and out into the night. It fell a considerable distance from the wall,
  and the wind, catching the flames, lifted them high so that all the
  surroundings were suddenly and brilliantly illumined.</p>

  <p>It revealed the sharpshooter at the opposite window. It revealed the two
  skulkers midway between the fronts of the shacks. It showed, to the rear,
  three more breaking toward the shack at full speed. But one and all were
  checked. They yelled with astonishment and fear at this unexpected flood of
  light, while at the same time reechoed shouts of rage and fear from the other
  side of the house proved that Hugh Dawn had carried out his portion of the
  maneuver with equal success. Ronicky, aiming only at light, gained more than
  light. He derived the advantage of a surprise attack.</p>

  <p>He began shooting&mdash;and shooting to kill. Across the room he heard the
  roaring of Hugh Dawn's gun as the sturdy old warrior began pumping lead from
  two revolvers at the same time. Very well. He might make a terrific amount of
  noise, but it was hardly likely that he would do as much execution as this
  slender, keen-eyed fellow at the window, planting his shots and wasting few
  of them indeed.</p>

  <p>First of all he fired not at the onrushing forms, but directed his
  attention to the man at the opposite window. For he possessed a rifle, and he
  could take advantage of the flaring light from the waste, as it burned, to
  drive home a fatal shot. Straight at him Ronicky drove his first bullet, and
  he saw the other fling up his arms and sink from sight without a word.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the two men in the front had, after their moment of
  hesitation on being flooded with light, resumed their forward run, and
  another stride would take them into shelter around the corner of the hut. One
  of these Ronicky nailed midstride and saw the fellow pitch to his fate with a
  shrill scream of pain. But his companion shot out of view behind the corner
  of the logs.</p>

  <p>There would be a future danger, for the man was now under the wall, and
  the logs protected him fully as much as they protected the men inside the
  hut.</p>

  <p>Ronicky gave that danger only a fleeting thought. He had whirled, and now
  he looked to the south, where the three had been sweeping up from the
  woods.</p>

  <p>His first bullet went wild&mdash;the sudden change of direction had thrown
  him off. His second bullet made the middle man of the three stagger and reel,
  but the ruffian kept on running. His third shot sent the left-hand fellow
  whirling about, and he dropped on his face. Before he could fire again, both
  of the survivors of the rush were under the protection of the walls.</p>

  <p>At the same instant the firing of Hugh Dawn stopped, and Ronicky wheeled
  toward his companion.</p>

  <p>"How many?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"Nailed one, sure," replied Hugh Dawn, breathing hard. "And you?"</p>

  <p>"Three!" murmured Ronicky. "Down, Hugh!"</p>

  <p>He followed his own precepts by flattening himself against the floor. Well
  for him that he did so! Scarcely was he down and Hugh crouched likewise in
  the far and shadowy corner of the hut, when a shadowy form darted into the
  open doorway and blazed away at the window where Ronicky had been standing.
  Too late the outlaw saw the target sprawled along the floor instead of erect,
  and changed his aim. Before he could get in a second shot Ronicky had fired
  for the sixth time, and the other, gasping with agony, spun over and
  disappeared through the doorway and into the outer night.</p>

  <p>Then came silence.</p>

  <p>"Did you turn 'em?" whispered Ronicky.</p>

  <p>"Every one! One down and four went back&mdash;and a couple of them, I
  think, was nicked a little!"</p>

  <p>His exultation shook his voice. But Ronicky pointed to the rear of the
  house with a warning gesture.</p>

  <p>Of the eleven men of Moon's band, four had fallen dead, or apparently
  dead, in the attack. Two had been badly wounded by Ronicky, and perhaps one
  or more of the others had been struck by the bullets of Hugh Dawn. In a word,
  where the odds had been, counting Jack Moon, twelve to two, they had suddenly
  shrunk through this rushing assault and its attendant casualties to the far
  less imposing total of seven to two. Of the seven, at least two were badly
  hurt. It left at the most not more than five fighting effectives. But
  Ronicky, not knowing that Jack Moon had deserted his men, and never dreaming
  but that he was the directing mind behind the rush, counted the odds still
  three to one.</p>

  <p>The attack had at least placed the outlaws in a superior position to that
  which they had held before. One wounded man and one man sound in body and
  limb were now under the rear wall of the shack, sheltered by their nearness
  to it against gunfire from Ronicky or Dawn. Moreover&mdash;an incalculable
  advantage&mdash;they could attack suddenly, and they could overhear any but
  the most secretly whispered communications of Ronicky and Dawn.</p>

  <p>That very nearness, however, suggested to Ronicky the next maneuver.</p>

  <p>"Watch that rear wall, Hugh!" he called loudly.</p>

  <p>"Two of the skunks are behind it and may fire through the logs. Watch it
  close!"</p>

  <p>He added in a sudden whisper at the very ear of his companion: "We've got
  to get out now, Hugh, or wait here and be stuck like rats in the morning. We
  got to get out! The only way is to make a break across the clearing. You see?
  They've got two men right under the rear wall now, and that makes it so's we
  can't shoot out from the back door. The rest of 'em will come up on that
  side, and then they'll have us six to two, and we're goners at close
  range!"</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn nodded.</p>

  <p>"Straight across the clearing when I give the word," said Ronicky swiftly,
  taking command as though it had been agreed to put matters into his hands in
  the crisis. The older man nodded without a word and set his jaw grimly at the
  thought of that desperate venture.</p>

  <p>Ronicky, meantime, was calmly reloading his revolver, keeping the weapon
  which he had taken from the holster of Bud Kent as a reserve of ammunition.
  Hugh Dawn imitated the good example.</p>

  <p>The fire from the flaming waste was gradually decreasing. The oil which
  had made the flare so great had now been well nigh exhausted, and the hard
  light decreased in proportion; but it was still far too bright to admit of a
  rush for the safe darkness of the trees. A new and more dangerous expedient
  came to Ronicky Doone.</p>

  <p>"Watch well and keep your nerve," he cautioned Dawn, still in the most
  guarded whisper. "I'm going to explore!"</p>

  <p>So saying, he dropped to his knees and boldly slid out from the front door
  of the little building and toward its left side. In that direction, as he had
  noted with a glance, the quantity of ignited waste which Hugh Dawn had thrown
  through the rear door had been far less than that which he himself had flung
  out. Accordingly, while that which he himself had tossed out was still
  blazing, the waste of Hugh Dawn was now a darkening mass of cinders casting
  hardly any light. In that direction, therefore, he hoped to escape
  observation.</p>

  <p>He stayed close to the wall, wriggling forward slowly and constantly
  scanning the trees before him in search of the glint of a rifle or revolver
  raised to shoot. But he caught no such deadly glimmer, and for sound there
  came only the stifled groaning of the wounded men.</p>

  <p>So he came, pushing his revolver before him in extended right hand, to the
  rear of the house and glanced around the corner. As he had expected, he found
  two men there. But their condition was not at all what he had anticipated.
  The one lay on his back with his arms cast out crosswise. Above him knelt the
  huge body of Silas Treat who was making gestures toward the forest as though
  silently to encourage his backward comrades to come to his aid in this
  advanced position.</p>

  <p>Perhaps they could not see him; perhaps their nerve was not up to
  undertaking. At any rate, no one had as yet ventured forth. As for the
  wounded man, it must be he who had stumbled when Ronicky fired the second
  time at the group of three; and he was far gone, if not fatally hurt. Not an
  arm's length away was the immense back of Si Treat, seemingly confident that
  his closeness to the wall made attack from the house impossible.</p>

  <p>Ronicky shoved his revolver against the back of the giant's neck. There
  was a quiver and then a stiffening in that immense body. Then Silas Treat
  turned his head slowly and without a sound stared into the face of
  Ronicky.</p>

  <p>Why they were not observed, Ronicky could not tell, unless the rest of the
  band had now shifted around to the shack from which the first of the assault
  had been launched.</p>

  <p>"Drop your gun!" commanded Ronicky, noting from the corner of his eye that
  the wounded man made no effort to interfere&mdash;perhaps he was swooning, as
  a matter of fact.</p>

  <p>Si Treat obeyed without a word, tossing the gun into the shadows.</p>

  <p>"Crawl past me," whispered Ronicky to his captive, "and mind that you go
  slow so's nobody can see you from the forest. With the first shot that's
  fired, I sink a chunk of lead into your heart, Si! Now move!"</p>

  <p>Without answer Silas Treat began obediently to work his way around
  Ronicky, past the corner of the shack, and down its side until at Ronicky's
  order he turned into the interior of the little house.</p>

  <p>"Now get back against that wall," commanded Ronicky, "and keep your hands
  over your head. That's right. Hugh, get that rope and tie him, and tie him
  hard. I ought to stick a knife into the skunk, and I will if he don't talk
  out!"</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn, muttering in his astonishment, obeyed and bound their
  formidable captive tightly. Si Treat, in the meantime, retained an immobile
  expression, as they could see by the last glimmer of the burning waste.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Ronicky, "talk fast and talk straight. Part of what I'm going
  to ask you I already know. If I catch you in a lie, it's the last word you
  speak. Understand?"</p>

  <p>Treat nodded.</p>

  <p>"First: Where's the rest of 'em?"</p>

  <p>"Gone blind," said the big man savagely, "or else you'd be dead sure,
  Doone! But they're gone blind. Most like they've sneaked back in the trees to
  tie up some little cut places where they got nicked. They ain't got the nerve
  of Baldy McNair. He kept coming after he was drilled for fair."</p>

  <p>"That's Baldy lying behind the house?"</p>

  <p>"That's him."</p>

  <p>"Are any of 'em in the shack next to us here?"</p>

  <p>"Nope. Not a soul, unless they sneaked there, and I didn't see 'em. But
  they won't come that close. They're licked! The yaller dogs! They're licked,
  or they'd of follered me, and then we'd of had you!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe," said Ronicky, stumbling in his haste to get at the desired
  information, "but Where's Jack Moon? Did he go down?"</p>

  <p>"Moon? I dunno where he is. Maybe he's deserted. I left him in that little
  clearing up the hill with the girl. Maybe he's run off with her. He ain't
  showed up since we started the party."</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone groaned.</p>

  <p>"Gone off with Jerry?"</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn inhaled audibly. "It's a lie!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Look here," said Silas Treat, in the same singular calm. "I ain't got any
  call for lying or playing in with the rest of them swine outside. I done my
  part. They didn't do theirs. I'm through with 'em. All the good ones are done
  for, anyway, and Moon's band is busted up. Kent and Bush are dead. Corrigan's
  dead. Craig is dead and others along with him, and Baldy McNair is lying on
  his back nearer death than living. Moon's band is busted up, and Moon himself
  has beat it off with a piece of calico. I'll never trust or foller another
  man so long's I live!"</p>

  <p>"Gag him!" commanded Ronicky. "Gag him so's he can't yell. Hugh, we got to
  make our break, and we got to make it now. First: Where's the hosses?"</p>

  <p>"Over in the woods behind the third shack."</p>

  <p>"Any of 'em saddled?"</p>

  <p>"Three or four, I guess."</p>

  <p>"That's all!"</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap26"
     name="chap26">XXVI. ESCAPE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At the word Dawn clapped the gag, which he had meantime
improvised,
  between the teeth of the captive and secured it firmly.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Ronicky, "run for it!"</p>

  <p>And he darted through the door, followed at his heels by the older man.
  Half the distance to the trees they had covered with flying haste when there
  was a yell behind them&mdash;a yell from Silas Treat, who had so quickly
  worked out the gag that silenced him. Then&mdash;he must have burst the cords
  that held him by an exertion of his tremendous strength and scooped up a
  fallen revolver&mdash;a storm of bullets was driven after the fugitives.</p>

  <p>But the distance was great, and Ronicky set the example of dodging from
  side to side as he ran. In a moment, though, the bullets still whistling and
  crashing through the boughs around them, Ronicky had reached the safety of
  the forest and turned panting to Dawn.</p>

  <p>"Safe?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Thank Heaven! And you, Ronicky?"</p>

  <p>"Make for the hosses. Get two and come back. I'll keep 'em dancing to our
  music while you get 'em!"</p>

  <p>Dawn disappeared, and Ronicky faced the enemy. There was a new confusion
  of shouts. The enormous voice of Silas Treat was giving directions. The rest
  of Moon's shattered crew was coming to the firing line, and a scattering of
  shots was pumped toward the place where Ronicky had disappeared. He must give
  them the opinion that he and Dawn were preparing to make at least a short
  stand in this direction. Accordingly, he began to run from tree to tree,
  firing two shots in quick succession and then two more from another place, so
  as to give the effect of a pair of fighters working along the edge of the
  forest. He was aiming at the flashes on the far side of the clearing, but he
  had no hope of striking a target, and he was not surprised when no cries of
  pain greeted his attack. In a moment they would send a couple of men sifting
  around the edge of the clearing to make a flank attack, but now came Hugh
  Dawn leading one horse and riding another. One bound carried Ronicky into the
  saddle, and he and Dawn spurred recklessly into the heart of the woods.</p>

  <p>Behind them rose fresh yells of dismay, and the firing ceased. Of course
  they would pursue, but unless Ronicky were hugely mistaken, they would not
  pursue far through the darkness of the woods. Dawn was indeed beginning in
  the east, but the pines were thick enough to shut out the scattered rays of
  light and leave deep night beneath the lower branches.</p>

  <p>And to follow an armed enemy who had proved the sharpness of his teeth
  through such a thicket as this would probably overtask the worn nerves of the
  outlaws. Besides, he shrewdly guessed that they had had enough of fighting to
  last them for many days.</p>

  <p>Another interest was larger in the mind of Ronicky. He plunged with Hugh
  Dawn straight up the slope until he came to the clearing where Treat had said
  Jack Moon had last gone with the girl.</p>

  <p>It was quite empty, as he broke into the open space with his revolver
  poised. Drawing up his horse with a groan, he cried to Dawn: "Treat was
  right. The devil has taken Jerry."</p>

  <p>"Ay," said the despairing father, "devil he is and doubly a devil, but
  well never get him tonight, Ronicky. He's taken the grays. I seen that they
  weren't among the rest of the hosses, though I looked for 'em. On the grays
  he'll shake his heels in our faces, lad, or the faces of any hosses in these
  parts. They've got the foot. We can't catch 'em!"</p>

  <p>For answer Ronicky looked a moment in silence at his companion and then
  whistled a peculiarly high and piercing note, long held. Then he sat with his
  head canted a little to one side, listening intently.</p>

  <p>"How come?" growled Hugh Dawn uneasily. "Calling up Moon's gang of
  cutthroats?"</p>

  <p>But far away, faint as a small echo, the answer came in the form of a
  neigh. Ronicky smiled and shook his head at his companion.</p>

  <p>"You hear?"</p>

  <p>"It's Lou," said the other, a little awed. "She's like a man for sense,
  Ronicky."</p>

  <p>"Better'n most men," answered Ronicky tersely and whistled again.</p>

  <p>The answer this time was much closer. Then they heard a crashing in the
  underbrush, and the beautiful mare came like a bullet out of the trees and
  glinted in the dawnlight of the clearing. Beside Ronicky she drew up,
  snorting her pleasure at the reunion.</p>

  <p>A change of saddles was quickly made, and now, on the back of the mare,
  Ronicky laughed with joy.</p>

  <p>"Now let Jack Moon ride hard," he said, "because, no matter how much foot
  the grays have, I'm going to run 'em into the ground&mdash;if I can ever pick
  up the trail. But Lord knows where they've gone. Can you guess, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"Can't make a good guess," the older man returned, watching with an
  appreciative eye while the bay mare danced in her eagerness to be off. "But
  how'm I to keep up with that little streak of lightning you're on now?"</p>

  <p>"You won't keep up," answered Ronicky. "Never come across a hoss in the
  mountains that could keep up, partner."</p>

  <p>Now the gray morning was brightening each moment, and already the light
  was so clear that they could look back into the heart of the hollow and see
  the clearing and the shacks. There was no pursuit apparently. Small figures
  of men moved here and there hurriedly. There was a knot of horses, looking as
  small as ants in the distance, in the central space.</p>

  <p>"I knew," muttered Ronicky Doone, "that there was a curse on that treasure
  of Cosslett's. We ain't the men that dug the stuff out of the ground in the
  first place, and neither did they give it to us. Hugh, they's going to be a
  curse wherever that gold travels!"</p>

  <p>"I got none of it," said Hugh Dawn almost cheerfully. "Left it all behind
  in the shack. And I think you're right, Ronicky. But now where do we
  head?"</p>

  <p>"We can only guess. Where would a smart gent like Jack Moon go if he
  wanted to throw folks off the trail?"</p>

  <p>"North was where he and the band expected to head."</p>

  <p>"That's why he won't head there. And over to the east the ground slopes
  too easy and smooth. That's where folks would naturally think that Moon had
  gone trying to get away. But most like, just to throw us off, Moon has taken
  the west road, through those hills. The harder the road, the less chance we'd
  have to foller him on it. Ain't that the way he'd think?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno, Ronicky. But it sounds pretty reasonable, except that for my
  part I'd take the east road. That's where he must of gone."</p>

  <p>"Take it if you want. I go west."</p>

  <p>"Take it, then. We'll each try a road. And if we both miss?"</p>

  <p>"I'll see you in Trainor&mdash;if I come through alive."</p>

  <p>"Good-by, Ronicky&mdash;and Heaven bless you!"</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone waved his hand cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"You look happy," said the older man curiously, "like you was going to a
  party, son!"</p>

  <p>"I am," said Ronicky Doone. "I'm going on the trail of the gent I'd rather
  meet than anybody in the world. Good luck, Hugh!"</p>

  <p>Hugh Dawn waved again and then watched Ronicky send his mare at a gallop
  down through the sparsely wooded slope leading toward the west. He kept on
  watching as the rider disappeared in the thicket in the lower hollow, and
  until Ronicky came into view again on the farther slope. He was still
  allowing Lou to keep a swift pace, and he was riding jauntily erect, as
  though he rode to a feast.</p>

  <p>Then Hugh Dawn turned his face east and trotted down through the
  trees.</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap27"
     name="chap27">XXVII. THE THREAT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was, indeed, down the western trail taken by Ronicky,
that Jack Moon
  had urged his horses with Jerry Dawn at his side, and never before had the
  leader ridden with such high hopes of great success to lure him on. The
  weariness of the girl was a great part in his favor. He had well nigh
  convinced her of the honesty of his intentions during the first part of the
  ride, and now, as the long strain of anxiety and of physical effort during
  the past few days began to tell upon her, she turned to the strong man beside
  her automatically for assistance and guidance. If she had been in full
  possession of her natural keenness, she might have probed motives and
  probabilities far more deeply. But as it was, she took for granted, it
  seemed, in the mental fog that springs out of physical exhaustion, that Jack
  Moon was a rock of support.</p>

  <p>She had ceased riding erect and lightly in the saddle by the time the sun
  pushed up out of the eastern trees and looked down at them as they twisted
  along a narrow trail on a mountainside. Now her head had lowered a little,
  and one hand rested heavily on the pommel of the saddle. Sometimes he thought
  that she was on the verge of falling asleep, so heavily she swung to one side
  or another as the big gray turned a sharp corner of the trail, but these
  swerves always wakened her a little and made her smile at her companion with
  dim amusement. The outlaw pressed close to her side to make sure that she
  should not fall.</p>

  <p>In all his dark and cruel career he had never come so close to a good and
  pure emotion as he had come now. To him the girl in her weariness and
  helplessness was a more controlling power than a hundred men with guns
  rushing at him. The night of sleeplessness, with other dreary nights of
  watching before, had robbed her of all sprightliness of mind, all elasticity
  of body. She had become, mentally and physically, a child. He could mold her
  as he would. Should he take advantage of her now, to press on her the great
  desire which had been beating at his brain since he first saw her those few
  short days before?</p>

  <p>Watching her wavering in the saddle, he decided that for very shame he
  could not trouble her with his importunities. But looking more closely again,
  and this time at her bowed face, it seemed to Jack Moon that there was
  nothing in the world so tender or so perfectly beautiful as the line of her
  profile, curving over brow and nose and lips and chin and rounded throat.
  Behind all the gentleness, he knew there was more courage than ordinarily
  comes to the lot of woman. All in all, it seemed to him that he had at last
  found a helpmate &mdash;the woman he wished to make his wife.</p>

  <p>It must be said in justice to the man that in his associations with women
  he had ever played an honorable role. Whatever his ways with men, he had kept
  his trickery for them alone, and he had reserved for womankind as much
  reverence as he possessed. He was one of those odd fellows who, in the midst
  of a thousand crimes, retain a measure of self-respect by adhering to
  standards of one kind or another. It is not an unusual characteristic of
  criminals. There are murderers who kill for a price, and a cheap price, at
  that, who would scorn to commit an act of thievery. There are robbers who
  would not keep themselves from starving by descending to such a pitifully
  small act as picking a pocket. But with Jack Moon the exception had been a
  very large one&mdash;he had built a solid reputation as a man who never broke
  his word.</p>

  <p>He writhed with shame and anguish of spirit to think that at last he had
  shattered the painfully acquired repute. He had betrayed his own followers,
  he had tricked and betrayed Ronicky Doone, he had betrayed Hugh Dawn. But he
  had lied and perjured himself for the sake of the girl, and he had the price
  of his sin with him. At least he had her presence. How far he was from having
  won her confidence, her affection, remained to be seen. In the meantime, she
  was here beside him, and as the miser, looking at his gold, makes small the
  privations he has endured to heap up the money, so Jack Moon, looking at the
  girl, sneered at the lost honor which she had cost him.</p>

  <p>Yet, how much of her was his? How truly did she trust him? Might it not be
  that he had paid the terrible price simply for the sake of a single ride with
  her? All of these possibilities swarmed through the tormented mind of the
  outlaw, but he forced them away. It was too much to be considered. Never
  before had he laid siege to the mind of a man without eventually winning him
  over, and surely a single, weak woman could not endure against his
  persuasiveness!</p>

  <p>But before she could even listen to him, she must be stimulated to
  complete wakefulness. He halted his party, helped the girl dismount, and
  built a camp fire hastily. Over it he made coffee, finding all the materials
  necessary in the pack which was behind the saddle on Jerry's horse. Having
  prepared a steaming cup of the coffee, he gave it to the girl. Bacon and
  cracker sandwiches completed the meal, but they both ate ravenously; and
  before the brief repast was ended, the color was coming back into the face of
  the girl. Still he did not begin his talk, but waited until they were once
  more on the trail.</p>

  <p>Of course there was not a chance in a thousand that he would be pursued
  &mdash;not a chance, unless Ronicky Doone escaped from the band&mdash;which
  was absurd&mdash;and then was able to guess what trail the fugitive leader
  had taken. But there was not a single danger in a thousand possibilities that
  Ronicky Doone, if he escaped from the besieged shack, would even be able to
  guess that the leader of the outlaws was a fugitive! Still Jack Moon
  preferred to make surety doubly sure. So he pressed steadily westward. Before
  long they would come down into the lowlands; they would begin to enter a
  district where the plain was green with irrigation, and where little
  agricultural villages were dotting the green here and there. In one of these,
  if his persuasions took effect, he could find the minister. In one of these
  the ceremony could be performed.</p>

  <p>Still he delayed beginning the talk. It was hard to find the right
  opening. His heartbeat began to quicken; and he could have blessed her when
  she said suddenly: "It's all like a happy dream, you know. We've been through
  a nightmare time; it's unreal. I've been trying to convince myself that I've
  actually seen Cosslett's gold, but I can't."</p>

  <p>"And yet we have four horses here, all loaded with it! More than a hundred
  thousand dollars, Jerry!"</p>

  <p>"I wish it weren't here!" she answered. "There's no luck about it."</p>

  <p>"If you want," he answered, "I'll pitch the gold down into that ravine and
  let it lie there. Just say the word!"</p>

  <p>The violence of his expression made her glance up to his face, startled;
  she glanced away as quickly. Such talk as this could mean only one thing.
  Moreover, she had seen a pale, intense face and eyes that burned out of it at
  her. The usual pale calm was gone from Jack Moon. He was no longer the aloof,
  superior leader. He was simply a man, a man in love. She was frightened, but
  she was not altogether displeased. She cast about, however, for some other
  topic to carry the talk away from the danger point.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you should. I don't know. Perhaps Ronicky was right."</p>

  <p>Moon, gritting his teeth, saw that he must not take up the subject.
  Apparently the girl had recovered from her former aversion to Ronicky.</p>

  <p>"Doone is all right," he said mildly. "Anyway, he stuck by your father in
  the last pinch."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to make of it," she murmured. "First he seems to throw
  his own life away, fighting for us against you and your men. He does it for
  nothing&mdash;without a hope of reward. Then he sells his honor and becomes
  one of your band. Next he leaves the band and at the last moment throws
  himself on the side of my father again. How do you explain him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't try to," said the leader carelessly, far more carelessly than he
  really wished to speak. "He's just a wild man. That's all! Some gents are all
  straight and sane about most things, but go off on one subject. That's the
  way with Doone. Talks straight till he gets a chance to fight. Then he goes
  mad.</p>

  <p>"There's only one thing I'm sorry about," went on Moon, changing the
  subject, "and that's the gold. I promised to get all of it for your father.
  But all I can give him is the stuff we have with us."</p>

  <p>"You're going to give that to him?"</p>

  <p>"Do you think I'm carrying it for my own use?" asked the bandit
  sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>That won him a smile of gratitude.</p>

  <p>"I knew you were brave," she said, "and I knew you could be gentle and
  kind, but I didn't know that you could be so generous."</p>

  <p>"It's not for my sake or for his," answered Jack Moon. "It's you that have
  taught me what to do."</p>

  <p>He had come close to the point now, and he must press on.</p>

  <p>"Will you let me tell you what I've been planning?"</p>

  <p>She knew well enough what direction he was taking now, yet she could not
  stop him.</p>

  <p>"I'm going East," said Jack Moon. "You might think that that's a fool play
  to make. But mighty few people have ever seen my face. And them that have,
  would never know me when I'm dressed up in store clothes and wearing gloves
  and talking smooth. I can put on smooth talk well enough, and lay off on the
  bum grammar, too, Jerry. You trust to that! So what's to keep me from popping
  up in the East&mdash;in New York, say, with a new name and plenty of money to
  start me off in business of some kind? What's to stop me from all of
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said the girl heartily. "I wish you joy with all my heart. I
  know you can win out. Nobody would trail you there."</p>

  <p>"Nobody," echoed Jack Moon. "And by the same way that I've made a place
  for myself in the mountains, I'll make a place for myself in business, and
  I'll make money for myself, too. It won't be hard!"</p>

  <p>"No," agreed the girl. "You were born to lead men, Jack, and you can lead
  them in cities as well as you can in the mountains!"</p>

  <p>"Yet," said Jack Moon, "all the money in the world, tied up with a life in
  a city, wouldn't make up for the freedom I have in the mountains. Up here I'm
  a king. Down there I'll be just lost in the crowd. You see?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, dreading what was to come.</p>

  <p>"But there's one thing that would make me go&mdash;one thing that would
  lead me anywhere, Jerry, and that's you! Understand? You, Jerry!"</p>

  <p>He swerved his horse close to her and rode with his left hand on the
  cantle of her saddle. He was leaning so that, when she looked up to him, his
  tensed face was hardly an inch away. Jerry Dawn grew pale. His words came in
  a stream now.</p>

  <p>"Since I met you, Jerry, I've wanted one thing in the world more than all
  the rest of it, and that's you. I've quit the band, to follow you. I've given
  up what it's taken me years to build, to follow you. Understand? I'm through
  with the mountains&mdash;I'm through with the men. I've given it up for a new
  life, and the heart of the new life is you, Jerry. Without you, it's nothing
  to me. With you, it's everything. You're getting pale, honey, but it's not
  because you're afraid. You're too steady to do that. You know that, whatever
  I've been to the rest of the world, you can trust me to the finish. Will you
  tell me that, Jerry? Look up and tell me that!"</p>

  <p>She flushed, frightened and miserable.</p>

  <p>"But don't you see. Jack, that I can only answer you&mdash;honestly
  &mdash;in one way, if I answer yes to all that?"</p>

  <p>"What way?"</p>

  <p>"I can only say that I care for you as you care for me. I&mdash;I don't,
  Jack."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't," went on Moon. "It ain't possible that you could. I don't
  expect you to&mdash;yet. But with time, Jerry, I'll pour so much love around
  you that you can't help giving some of it back, any more than a mirror can
  help shining back some firelight! Will you believe that, or d'you see me only
  as an outlaw talking crazy words that mean nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Whatever you may have been," she answered, "I tell you truly now that
  you've honored me by saying all this to me. But what can I do? I simply don't
  care for you in that way, Jack. I know that I owe the life of my father to
  you, and still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jerry," he implored her, "think it over. Think quick and hard. If you
  turn me down, I go back where I started. I build a new band. I run the
  mountains again. But if you say the word, I'll leave the hills. I'll go to
  the city. I'll work to make you a home and happiness as no other man ever
  worked for a woman."</p>

  <p>Sincerity was in his voice and in his heart. The very fact that she was
  repulsing him made her the more desirable to Jack Moon. It seemed to him then
  that the cool gray eyes and the pale, trembling lips of the girl were worth
  more to him than ten thousand treasures as rich as the treasure of
  Cosslett.</p>

  <p>"I can't answer you in any other way," answered Jerry.</p>

  <p>"Is there somebody else?" he said through his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Nobody."</p>

  <p>"It's that smooth-faced, smiling, good-looking Ronicky Doone?"</p>

  <p>"On my honor, there's no one!"</p>

  <p>"Then, Jerry, the fact that you don't love me as much as I do you is just
  nothing! I can't expect you to. But in time I'll teach you how. It takes time
  for all great things. I'll surround you with it like a wall. You'll know
  nothing else. Look here. I know what it is to run men. It's better than
  running a thousand horses to run one man. And me, Jerry&mdash;I've run men
  and run 'em by the scores; and wherever I go, I'll still run men!"</p>

  <p>He raised his great head, and his voice swelled.</p>

  <p>"Wherever I've gone, I've been king," he declared. "I've never met a man
  that could match me if it came to strength of muscles or strength of quick
  thinking. I've planned better than the others, and I've beat 'em in cunning
  and in tricks. I've read their minds and beat them always. Just the same way,
  when it come to fighting, I've beat 'em at fighting. I'm going to go East,
  Jerry, if you say the word, and do the same thing there that I've done in the
  West. I'm going to run men&mdash;run 'em by the score&mdash;have 'em working
  for me! And you, Jerry&mdash;you'll be the power behind. You'll be the rider
  with your hand on the reins. I'll run scores, and you'll run me. You'll be
  like a queen on a throne, Jerry. You hear?"</p>

  <p>She believed him, as she had reason to. It was within his capabilities to
  do as he said&mdash;to build up a power relentlessly strong, to make her
  rich, to pour treasures into her lap. Wherever he went, he would be king, and
  she, by very virtue of the fact that she did not love him blindly, could be
  absolute dictator in his life and carry the great power of the man in the
  palm of her hand to do with it as she pleased.</p>

  <p>Yet she shook her head, though she paused a moment before she answered. It
  had been a great temptation. Moreover, she knew that the man would lead as
  straight a life, for her sake, as he had led a criminal one for his own
  sake.</p>

  <p>"I can't do it," she said simply. "I tell you frankly, Jack, that I admire
  you for your strength, and I'm grateful with all my soul for what you've done
  for me. But I respect you too much, and I respect all the possibilities in
  you too much, to do what you ask. There's no use talking any further!"</p>

  <p>It was her calmness that laid the whip on him more than her words. He had
  debased himself before her. He had offered to sell himself. He had, so to
  speak, put a saddle on his back and offered to go where she bid him, and her
  refusal tortured him.</p>

  <p>"Then," he said suddenly, "Heaven help Hugh Dawn!"</p>

  <p>She winced and stared at him.</p>

  <p>"I say it again," said the outlaw. "Heaven help Hugh Dawn!"</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap28"
     name="chap28">XXVIII. THE LAST CARD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was no question about the threat which his words
implied. He had
  drawn away from her as he spoke, and now he sat gloomily, drawing his horse
  to a halt.</p>

  <p>"Here's where I leave you," said Jack Moon. "You go on with the hosses,
  and you take the gold. I've promised you that, and I keep my promise."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I value the money a straw's weight?" she cried in terror.
  "Jack, what do you mean about my father?"</p>

  <p>"Why, Jerry," he said, frowning in wonder that she did not understand,
  "you see there ain't more'n two ways open to me. Either I sell myself out to
  you and go East as your husband, or else I go back up the north trail and
  meet my boys and take command again. I'll have to find an explanation for
  being away so long, but I'll explain it away, right enough, and take command;
  and, once back in command, I'll forget about you as though you never
  existed!"</p>

  <p>"But my father?"</p>

  <p>"Why, the boys have a claim on his life&mdash;and he's got to go! He owes
  us a debt, and he's got to pay. I've busted too many rules already. Once back
  at the head of the band, I play the game."</p>

  <p>"You can't do it," breathed the girl. "You can't do it!"</p>

  <p>"You think so?" he answered, almost sneering. "You don't know me, Jerry.
  There's one thing I love more than the rest of the world, and that's you; but
  next to you I love power, and to me power is the band. The way I hold the
  band together is by being as cold as iron and as hard as iron. I rule 'em
  with a stiff rod, and they come to me when I tell 'em to come, they go when I
  tell 'em to go. One sign of softening, and they'll turn and sink their teeth
  in me. So I won't soften!"</p>

  <p>It was a bluff. He knew that he had already hopelessly lost the band. But
  it was a bluff which must win.</p>

  <p>"If I don't soften, I've got to get your father out of the way. His life
  is a forfeit. And it's got to be paid down. I go back up the north trail. I
  find the boys and swing 'em southward. Before night I ride down your father
  on the way to Trainor and leave him dead on the trail. There's nothing else
  to do."</p>

  <p>He turned his horse, waving to her, settled his hat more firmly on his
  head, and touched the gray with the spurs, but at the first leap he heard her
  voice calling faintly after him. He checked the gray and turned, his heart
  bounding with triumph.</p>

  <p>There she sat with her eyes almost closed in the pain of what she was to
  do, and both her hands clutched hard over the pommel of the saddle.</p>

  <p>"Come back to me," said Jerry Dawn sadly. "I didn't know it was possible.
  Even now I'd go down on my knees and beg with you, Jack Moon, except that I
  know it's worse than useless! You are what you say&mdash;hard as iron. I
  surrender. Tell me what I have to do. I'll do it. But I never will forgive
  you."</p>

  <p>A strange sound of choked triumph came from the throat of the outlaw. He
  had played his last card, to be sure, but that last card had been enough, and
  he had won. He forbore, however, from pressing his triumph on her.</p>

  <p>"We'll ride out of the hills and down into the valley," he said quietly.
  "And there well find a minister in the first town. In that town we'll be
  married. You understand, Jerry?"</p>

  <p>She swallowed and then nodded, never looking at him.</p>

  <p>"But when we're East, Jerry, I'll teach you to forgive me. This thing may
  be hard for you to do. But someday&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She raised a hand in mute entreaty, and he stopped abruptly. So they rode
  on in silence until they reached the crest of the highest mountain, where the
  trail drove straight down before them. Faraway, beyond the foothills,
  stretched the green fields of that rich farming country, and he could see the
  windows of the first town gleaming faintly in the early rays of the morning
  sun. There was, indeed, his promised land!</p>

  <p>There was a sound of a caught breath from the girl. He glanced aside at
  her and saw that she had turned in the saddle and was looking back, though
  when he turned to her she instantly righted herself in the saddle and faced
  forward again. But that stifled exclamation of pleasure, or fear, aroused his
  interest, and, searching the ranges of hills which stretched behind and below
  him in wave after wave, he saw, two crests away, the form of a horseman
  riding over a summit at full gallop.</p>

  <p>The outlaw set his teeth and whipped out the field glasses from the saddle
  pocket. By the time he had focused the glasses, he was able to catch only a
  glimpse as the horseman dipped out of sight among the trees, but that glimpse
  had been enough. He had made out the flashing sides of a bay horse. He had
  marked the gait of the animal, long and free as the flight of a swallow,
  dipping lightly up and down on the wind. There was no other horse in the
  range of the mountains with that high-headed grace, that spiritlike ease of
  gait. It was the mare, Lou, and that rider was Ronicky Doone!</p>

  <p>"Ride!" he called to the girl. "Ride hard, Jerry. Don't put your hopes in
  the fool behind us. He's late. He's too late, like all the rest that come up
  against Jack Moon. He's late, and he's beaten!"</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" cried the girl above the roar of the hoofs as the horses
  broke down the slope of the mountain.</p>

  <p>"Nobody worth thinking about," said the other. "A gent I could wait for
  and salt away with lead. But I ain't going to stain our first ride
  together."</p>

  <p>He saw a fleeting sneer cross her face, and the expression was to him like
  a blow. Then: "It's Ronicky Doone!" she cried. "Ah, Heaven bless him! It's
  Ronicky Doone, and you're running from him like a coward. Running from one
  man like a coward!"</p>

  <p>She was even more clever than he had suspected. But after all it was a
  childish ruse to attempt to badger him into pausing to vindicate his prowess
  in single combat, while she, perhaps in the midst of the battle, slipped away
  to safety and rode to warn her father that the devil himself was on their
  trails! No, Jack Moon merely smiled to himself. Let her show her teeth now.
  Later on he would teach her what discipline meant! As they spurred on, he
  noticed that her expression was rather thoughtful than sullen, rather
  studious than terrified.</p>

  <p>They came off the first long down slope of the mountain, and they began to
  climb the slope of the hill beyond, only a short rise before they would again
  have a declining grade to make their way the easier and the swifter. Here the
  girl fell a little behind, but still he could hear her speaking to the horse
  to urge it on.</p>

  <p>Then he heard the grunt of a horse brought to a halt, or wrenched away in
  a new direction. He turned in haste. Jerry Dawn had whirled the tall gray and
  was dashing back down the trail as fast as the spurs would drive her mount,
  and the lead rope which had been bringing the horse on was dangling in the
  air where she had severed it with a single slash of her knife.</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap29"
     name="chap29">XXIX. A VITAL BLOW</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The outlaw jerked loose the knot which bound him to his own
lead horse,
  swinging his gray about at the same time, and so he was off in pursuit, his
  teeth set, and one of those red rages which occasionally swept over him now
  blurring his eyes. Jerry had reached the long upslope of the mountain while
  he was still coming down from the hill, so that he gained with tremendous
  bounds on her, but now she was reaching into the saddlebags and throwing out
  the treasure of gold which weighted her horse. It fell on the grass and
  gleamed there, unregarded. What was gold, save a heavy metal, a worse than
  useless thing to her?</p>

  <p>Cursing bitterly, the leader saw the horse of the girl pull away, thus
  lightened, and he followed the example, hurling out what was in his own
  saddlebags. Then he bent himself to the serious work of the pursuit.</p>

  <p>She was not a dozen feet away. With a lariat he could have roped her horse
  and brought it to a halt, but there was no rope on his saddle, and he groaned
  because of the lack. With all his skill brought to bear on the problem, with
  merciless spurs urging on his mount, he tore after her, but, to favor her
  horse, she was a full seventy pounds lighter than her gigantic pursuer, and
  she rode with all the energy she could bring to bear.</p>

  <p>No matter how he swung himself with the gallop of his gray, still her
  mount drew away little by little, widening the gap between them. For they
  were going up a steep grade, and her weight told as it would never have done
  on the level; all of the outlaw's skill in the saddle was wasted. He could
  not gain, he could not keep even with the fugitive. He saw her turn her head
  and then shout with joyous triumph!</p>

  <p>It was worse than merely being distanced. In that merciless drive at full
  speed up the side of the hill they were burning up precious strength, and the
  grays would be far from the horses they had been before the spur was started.
  With spurs, with beating quirt, he drove his gray until he heard the breath
  of the honest beast come in great, wheezing gasps&mdash;and still the other
  gained, for the girl was whipping as fiercely as himself.</p>

  <p>There was nothing else for it. To continue that stern chase was simply to
  waste valuable time. Moon drew his revolver and poised it. Perhaps bluff,
  which had won for him before, would win again.</p>

  <p>"Jerry!" he shouted. "Stop or I'll shoot."</p>

  <p>She turned toward him, and he glimpsed the white, set face.</p>

  <p>"I swear it!" called Jack Moon. "I'll shoot unless you stop."</p>

  <p>But she merely raised her clenched fist and shook it back at him in hatred
  and defiance. And suddenly he loved her more than he had ever loved her
  before. Here, indeed, in this fearless girl, was a mate for him! But could he
  let her go? Yonder, once over the crest of the hill, she would have downslope
  to give her horse impetus, and they would be driving straight into the arms
  of Ronicky Doone. No, he decided fiercely, it was better, far better, to see
  her die than to let that chance come to him. He aimed with all the skill at
  his command at the right off hind leg of the fleeing gray and fired. In
  response there was only a greater burst of speed, and a streak of crimson
  leaped out on the hip of the wounded horse.</p>

  <p>Once more he fired, taking still more careful aim, and this time his
  bullet struck. The gray pitched up with a snort of pain; then his quarters
  crumbled beneath him as he strove to take the next driving stride uphill. He
  sank to the right, and he fell heavily, the girl being flung out of the
  saddle and turning twice over and over before she struck.</p>

  <p>She lay where she dropped, a queerly twisted body with outflung arms, and
  Jack Moon felt in his heart that she was dead. He was out of the stirrups in
  an instant and beside her, lifting her in his arms. There was a long gash in
  her forehead, but it was only a shallow flesh wound where the edge of a sharp
  rock had clipped the skin. For the rest, as he ran his swift hands over her
  body, he could feet no broken bones.</p>

  <p>Jerry was still alive, she was still with him. Though they had wasted
  priceless time and burned up the strength of one horse and destroyed another,
  there was still, perhaps, a fighting chance.</p>

  <p>The girl was not badly injured&mdash;merely stunned, it seemed; but the
  cut on her face was flowing. He whipped out his bandanna and knotted it as a
  crimson bandage about her head. Then he picked her up lightly, as though she
  had been a child, and ran back to the gray. Once more in the saddle, he
  spurred back along the hill, heading toward the two led horses. They must be
  his last resource now&mdash;and a bad one to mate against the speed and
  great-hearted courage of the bay mare, Lou.</p>

  <p>But in the meantime, here was the girl, for one moment at least, his. No
  matter that she was unconscious, for when her senses returned she would
  either weep or moan her despair. Only for this instant, as the gray bore them
  with staggering gallop down the hill and the wind whipped into his face, she
  was his beyond question. Gathering her close to him, he cupped her head in
  his free hand and kissed her lips.</p>

  <p>By the time he reached the led horses and drew up his own mount, the gray
  was broken of wind and trembling of limb. That burst up the hill had
  completely shattered his running powers, and he would not be good for an hour
  more of going such as lay before them. Therefore, he was less than nothing to
  Jack Moon.</p>

  <p>Instead, the outlaw intended to use the two remaining horses. Into one
  saddle he raised the girl. Into the other he cast himself; first emptying the
  gold from the pouches along the saddles, he sent the horses ahead at a
  reckless gallop. The girl, since he could no longer trust her for an instant,
  he allowed to sit motionless in her saddle; taking the reins of her mount, he
  urged on both horses.</p>

  <p>Truly, the girl had worked better than she knew. She had not delayed them
  in actual time more than ten minutes, but in fact the delay would prove a far
  more vital thing. Instead of the ground-devouring swing of the grays there
  was now the choppy stride of the cow ponies. The leader remembered how the
  bay mare, Lou, had skimmed over the ground. She was the queen of horses, and
  this pair were like dirt compared with her! Yes, Jerry Dawn had struck her
  blow at the vital moment, and perhaps in the end she would win. With anxious
  eyes Jack Moon turned and scanned what lay behind.</p>

  <p>All his sacrifice, he felt a moment later, would be in vain, for now, over
  the top of the mountain far behind, skimmed the form of the bay mare, Lou,
  running as smoothly as ever, running with exhaustless strength, and with the
  sunlight flashing from her wet sides. While Moon looked, the pursuer, small
  in the distance, tore off his hat and waved it&mdash;a cheering sign to the
  girl, a nameless threat to Jack Moon.</p><hr><br>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap30"
     name="chap30">XXX. THE TRAIL ENDS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Straight west Ronicky Doone had sent Lou when he parted
from Hugh Dawn.
  There was not a chance in ten that he would come on signs of the fugitive, if
  indeed the bandit had taken this way. It only remained to play the single
  chance bravely and strongly. So he laid a true course due west and let the
  mare do her gallant best. Then, when the sun was well up, and before and
  behind him the mountains were tossing in endless waves of rocky summits, he
  saw the two figures hurrying far before him over a crest two ranges away. At
  the very moment when the two looked back and saw him, he had sighted them,
  and, though at that distance he could not tell whether or not one was a man
  and one was a woman, he sent Lou like a red-bay streak down the
  mountainside.</p>

  <p>But when he struck the opposite slope, unlike the blind eagerness of the
  outlaw, and even though he were groaning at the thought of a further delay,
  Ronicky drew down the willing mare to a slow trot. In this fashion he climbed
  the steep slope, even forcing Lou to come back to a steady walk when the
  trail rose sheer before him, and finally slipping from the saddle and
  trotting at the side of the beautiful creature.</p>

  <p>She knew what this meant. When the master so favored her, to lighten her
  burden, it meant that he expected her, sooner or later, to give every ounce
  of her energy in his service. Well, let him make the call; she was prepared
  to answer. How different from the method of huge Jack Moon was this
  partnership of man and beast! As he trotted beside his struggling mare along
  that heartbreaking trail, Ronicky called out to her cheerily and patted her
  shining shoulder. When they reached the top of the heavy grade, he jumped
  into the saddle and was off like the wind.</p>

  <p>Down the next mountainside they dipped and climbed the farther rise. Down
  they went again, and, reaching the farther summit, Ronicky stiffened in the
  saddle and cried out in joy.</p>

  <p>Straight down below him lay the struggling figure of the prostrate gray,
  ruined forever. Farther still, in the hollow before the first rise, there was
  the glint of gold which had been thrown away. And over the first foothill
  &mdash;could he believe his eyes?&mdash;were the girl and Jack Moon, so close
  that he could identify the broad shoulders of the outlaw!</p>

  <p>He took the shorter slope of the hill swiftly and broke on to the rolling
  surface of the foothills. Now, indeed, the mare could run, and Ronicky let
  her head go. He kept a rein just strong enough to steady her and keep her
  running straight, just firm enough to straighten her out in case of a
  stumble; and so they flashed over range after range of the softly molded
  hills and came again in sight of the fugitives.</p>

  <p>They were riding on the last range of the hills, the girl sitting straight
  in the saddle with the red silk bandanna fluttering about her head. Jack Moon
  was flogging with his quirt and alternately spurring his own mount and the
  horse of the girl.</p>

  <p>But he was lost. Even had he had the speed of the long-legged grays to
  help him, he could not have stood off the steady challenge of Lou. She came
  like the wind overtaking a ship. In five minutes she would range beside them.
  Now lack Moon knew that the girl had indeed ruined his effort. The delay had
  been fatal.</p>

  <p>He made up his mind instantly, it seemed. Ronicky saw him cast loose the
  reins of the girl's horse and draw his revolver, and a terrible premonition
  darted through the brain of Ronicky. Was the heartless devil going to murder
  the woman he could not carry away with him?</p>

  <p>But that was not the purpose of the outlaw.</p>

  <p>"Swear by everything that's holy," he called to Jerry Dawn, "that you'll
  stand by with your hoss and not try to escape. Otherwise I'll kill the roan
  while I go back and attend to the fool that's coming up on us!"</p>

  <p>There was no hesitation in the mind of the girl. She had seen one poor
  creature pistoled by this remorseless fiend of a man, and she could not face
  the thing again.</p>

  <p>"I'll promise," she said. And she added fiercely: "But you'll never come
  back, Jack Moon!"</p>

  <p>He laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"The man ain't born," he declared, "that can stand me off in man-to-man
  fight."</p>

  <p>"That," said the girl coldly, "is why you've run away like a whipped cur
  ever since you sighted Ronicky Doone. Bah!"</p>

  <p>He blinked before her scorn, and then, through his teeth, he answered: "I
  played safe. I took no chances. But if you think I fear him or any man, watch
  me now! I'll come back riding Lou!"</p>

  <p>She trembled at the thought, but she kept her head high and showed no sign
  of her fear.</p>

  <p>"You dare not face him, Jack Moon," she said fiercely. "It's the beginning
  of the end. You've failed from the first, ever since Ronicky Doone crossed
  your path. I begin to see a hundred things. Somehow you've lied and blinded
  me with your lies. But now, in my heart, I know that Ronicky Doone was never
  untrue to my father. Jack Moon, heaven pity you, because as sure as honesty
  is stronger than crime, Ronicky Doone is going to kill you here on this hill.
  And all your tricks won't help you!"</p>

  <p>He looked to the side.</p>

  <p>There came the pursuer, drawing his mare back to a long and swinging
  canter as he saw that the outlaw no longer fled.</p>

  <p>Moon knew that, whatever happened, he had already lost Jerry. "Stand by,"
  he said. "Watch Ronicky Doone go down. And before I go, I'll tell you the
  truth. I've made my play, and I've lost; but I'll show you how little you've
  won. It wasn't a bluff that I told my boys to run back there in the hollow. I
  told them to rush the house and shoot to kill. And that's what they done.
  Doone got away&mdash;to be finished by me. But your father is dead back
  yonder in the hollow. Otherwise, wouldn't he be there with Ronicky? He's
  dead, and that's the end of his story. And now I'll finish Ronicky's."</p>

  <p>He saw her lips part and her eyes widen with horror; then he shut out the
  picture by whirling his horse toward the oncoming rider.</p>

  <p>Ronicky Doone made out no detail of that conversation, of course, but its
  general tenor was unmistakable. There sat the girl with her head bowed, and
  her face covered by her hands. Here was Jack Moon cantering toward him.</p>

  <p>He stopped Lou on the crest of the hill and slipped from the saddle. Why
  should he imperil her life by putting her in the way of a chance bullet, so
  long as the enemy were coming on to fight the battle out bravely, man to man,
  in fair contest? The good mare followed him a pace or two, whinnying softly
  as though to ask why he had left the saddle, but he checked her advance with
  a sharp word, and she halted obediently, lifting her head and pricking her
  ears in curiosity.</p>

  <p>Half a dozen paces from her, Ronicky paused and dropped his right hand on
  his hip, for the approaching rider had also slipped his revolver into the
  holster now. Though he did not follow Ronicky's humane example and dismount,
  he came on with one hand raised in the time-honored fashion of those who
  request a truce. Ronicky raised his own left hand as signal that the truce
  was granted, and the outlaw halted not more than half a dozen paces away,
  still in the saddle.</p>

  <p>He waited, his head high, his clear eye sparkling with alertness. Not a
  movement of the sweat-brightened body of the horse, not a stir of the face of
  the outlaw, escaped him.</p>

  <p>That face was set with unutterable grimness, though Jack Moon was striving
  to relax his expression and adopt one of careless self-confidence. He so far
  succeeded that he was able to smile down to Ronicky.</p>

  <p>"I see," he said, "that you're so plumb tired of living that you pretty
  near wore out your hoss trying to get close to me."</p>

  <p>"I see," answered Ronicky, with a smile to match that of the big fellow,
  "that you're so plumb fond of life that you wore out two horses trying to get
  away from me."</p>

  <p>Unquestionably, if there were an advantage in that exchange of words, it
  lay on the side of Ronicky Doone. Since, in a manner, this was the first blow
  for him, Jack Moon set his teeth and strove to drive away the gloomy
  foreboding which flooded his mind. The words of the girl, too, rang through
  his memory. She had been strangely confident that her champion must win. That
  confidence had gleamed in her steady eyes, and the memory of that light now
  served to darken the vision of the outlaw. But he must rouse himself from
  this depression. In another moment his life would be staked upon his speed of
  hand, his lightning surety of eye, and he would be mated against a fighter
  such as he had never before in his life faced.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, he stared straight into the eyes of Ronicky Doone. He had
  many a time made men cringe under the weight of his dominant will, but now
  the glance of Ronicky clashed against his own with equal force. This was to
  be no cheaply won victory!</p>

  <p>But the youngster was smiling&mdash;no, he was sneering.</p>

  <p>"Your nerve's going, Moon," he was saving calmly. "You'd better make your
  play now before it's all gone."</p>

  <p>"Make my play now? Make my play first? I ain't sunk to that, kid!"</p>

  <p>"You'll sink to that now," said Ronicky Doone. "Because you're wilting,
  Jack. The skunk in you is coming out to the surface. You're beat, and you
  know it. If you wait a minute more, you'll begin begging for life!"</p>

  <p>The sweat poured out on the forehead of Jack Moon. For it was true! And he
  did know it. A great weakness was sweeping over him. The nervous, lean
  fingers of Ronicky Doone fascinated him. How could he expect to beat the
  speed of those fingers with his own great paws? If only the smaller man were
  within grip&mdash;</p>

  <p>But he must act at once. Behind him the girl would look on. But the moment
  his hand moved for his gun there would be a convulsive downward flick of the
  hand now hanging so loosely, so carelessly at the hip of Ronicky. How cool
  the man was! What a devil of surety was in him!</p>

  <p>The chestnut, impatient, pranced a little and turned sidewise toward
  Ronicky. Then the trick came to the outlaw. The horse would be his bulwark.
  Mighty must be the bullet that could plow through the body of a horse and
  reach him. Quick as thought he flung himself down along the chestnut,
  whipping out his revolver as he fell, and, encircling the neck of the horse
  with his left hand, he leveled the revolver and fired under the throat of his
  mount point- blank at Ronicky Doone.</p>

  <p>But swift though his maneuver had been, it was slow compared with the
  lightning gun play of Ronicky. At the first twitch of the big man's body, the
  gun had been conjured into those lean fingers, and as the right shoulder and
  chest of the outlaw surged down on the other side of the horse&mdash;after
  all, it was an old Indian trick&mdash;the blaze of Doone's gun beat that of
  the man-killer's by a split part of a second. A small interval, indeed, very
  small&mdash;but just long enough to send the soul of a man winging from its
  body.</p>

  <p>Jack Moon, without a sound, without a groan, slipped out of the saddle and
  landed with heavy inertness on the ground, face down, and Ronicky Doone
  touched his shirt sleeve, where the bullet had flicked through the cloth.</p>

  <p>He went to Jack Moon and gave the fallen man a cursory examination. It had
  been instant death. Ronicky looked down with a sort of childlike wonder. How
  could one bullet have opened the way for the passage of the vital spirit from
  that enormous frame, so cunningly made for strength and endurance, so trained
  to feats of strength? How could one bullet have stopped forever the
  machinations of that crafty brain?</p>

  <p>Ronicky went slowly to the girl.</p>

  <p>She still sat with her face bowed in her arms, but when he came near,
  still covering her eyes, she reached out one hand toward him, fumbling like a
  blind person.</p>

  <p>"Ronicky!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" he said gently.</p>

  <p>"Dad?"</p>

  <p>"All's well with him, thank Heaven!"</p>

  <p>"Thank Heaven, and thanks to you. Oh, Ronicky, what have you done for
  us?"</p>

  <p>"Only helped your dad fight a ghost out of his past," said Ronicky Doone
  as gently as before. "Now that the ghost's gone, let's forget all about
  it!"</p>
