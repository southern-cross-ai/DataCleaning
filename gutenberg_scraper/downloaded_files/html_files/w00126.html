<h1>The Run of the Yellow Mail</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h1>Frank H. Spearman</h1>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<p>There wasn't another engineer on the division who dared talk to
Doubleday the way Jimmie Bradshaw did.</p>

<p>But Jimmie had a grievance, and every time he thought about it, it
made him nervous.</p>

<p>Ninety-six years. It seemed a good while to wait; yet in the regular
course of events on the mountain division there appeared no earlier
prospect of Jimmies getting a passenger run.</p>

<p>"Got your rights, ain't you?" said Doubleday, when Jimmie
complained.</p>

<p>"I have and I haven't," grumbled Jimmie, winking hard; "there's
younger men than I am on the fast runs."</p>

<p>"They got in on the strike; you've been told that a hundred times. We
can't get up another strike just to fin you out on a fast run. Hang on to
your freight. There's better men than you in Ireland up to their belt in
the bog, Jimmie."</p>

<p>"It's a pity they didn't leave you there, Doubleday."</p>

<p>"You'd have been a good while hunting for a freight run if they
had."</p>

<p>Then Jimmie would get mad and shake his finger and talk fast: "Just
the same, I'll have a fast run here when you're dead."</p>

<p>"Maybe; but I'll be alive a good while yet, my son," the master
mechanic would laugh. Then Jimmie would walk off very warm, and when he
got into private with himself he would wink furiously and say friction
things about Doubleday which needn't now be printed, because it is
different. However, the talk always ended that way, and Jimmie Bradshaw
knew it always would end that way.</p>

<p>The trouble was, no one on the division would take Jimmie seriously,
and he felt that the ambition of his life would never be fulfilled; that
he would go plugging to gray hairs and the grave on an old freight train;
and that even when he got to the right side of the Jordan there would
still be something like half a century between him and a fast run. It was
funny to hear him complaining about it, for everything, even his
troubles, came funny to him; and in talking he had an odd way of
stuttering with his eyes, which were red. In fact, Jimmie was nearly all
red; hair, face, hands &mdash; they said his teeth were freckled.</p>

<p>When the first rumors about the proposed Yellow Mail reached the
mountains Jimmie was running a new ten-wheeler; breaking her in on a
freight "for some fellow without a lick o' sense to use on a limited
passenger run," as Jimmie observed bitterly. The rumors about the mail
came at first like stray mallards &mdash; opening signs of winter &mdash;
and as the season advanced flew thicker and faster. Washington never was
very progressive in the matter of improving the transcontinental service,
but they once put in a postmaster-general down there, by mistake, who
wouldn't take the old song. When the bureau fellows that put their brains
up in curl papers told him it couldn't be done he smiled softly, but he
sent for the managers of the crack lines across the continent, without
suspecting how it bore incidentally on Jimmie Bradshaw's grievance
against his master mechanic.</p>

<p>The postmaster-general called the managers of the big lines, and they
had a dinner at Chamberlain's, and they told him the same thing. "It has
been tried," they said in the old, tired way; "really it can't be
done."</p>

<p>"California has been getting the worst of it for years on the mail
service," persisted the postmaster-general moderately. "But Californians
ought to have the best of it. We don't think anything about putting New
York mail in Chicago in twenty hours. It ought to be simple to cut half a
day across the continent and give San Francisco her mail a day earlier.
Where's the fall-down?" he asked, like one refusing no for an answer.</p>

<p>The general managers looked at our representative sympathetically, and
coughed cigar smoke his way to hide him.</p>

<p>"West of the Missouri," murmured a Pennsylvania swell, who pulled
indifferently at a fifty-cent cigar. Everybody at the table took a drink
on the expos&eacute;, except the general manager, who sat at that time
for the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>The West End representative was unhappily accustomed to facing the
finger of scorn on such occasions. It had become with our managers a
tradition. There was never a conference of continental lines in which we
were not scoffed at as the weak link in the chain of everything &mdash;
mail, passenger, specials, what not &mdash; the trouble was invariably
laid at our door.</p>

<p>But this time there was a new man sitting for the line at the
Chamberlain dinner: a youngish man with a face that set like cement when
the West End was trod upon.</p>

<p>The postmaster-general was inclined, from the reputation we had, to
look on our chap as a man looks at a dog without a pedigree, or at a dray
horse in a bunch of standard breeds. But something in the mouth of the
West End man gave him pause; since the Rough Riders, it has been a bit
different about verdicts on things Western. The postmaster-general
suppressed a rising sarcasm with a sip of Chartreuse, for the dinner was
ripening, and waited; nor did he mistake &mdash; the West Ender was about
to speak.</p>

<p>"Why west of the Missouri?" he asked, with a lift of the face that was
not altogether candid. The Pennsylvania man shrugged his brows; to
explain might have seemed indelicate.</p>

<p>"If it is put through, how much of it do you propose to take
yourself?" inquired our man, looking evenly at the Alleghany
official.</p>

<p>"Sixty-five miles, including stops from New York post-office to Canal
Street," replied the Pennsylvania man, and his words flowed with
irritating smoothness and ease.</p>

<p>"What do you take" continued the man with the jaw, turning to the
Burlington representative, who was struggling, belated, with an
artichoke.</p>

<p>"About seventy from Canal to Tenth and Mason. Say, seventy," repeated
the "Q" manager, with the lordliness of a man who has smiles to throw at
almost anybody, and knows it.</p>

<p>"Then suppose we say sixty-five from Tenth and Mason to Ogden,"
suggested the West Ender. There was a well-bred stare the table round, a
lifting of glasses to mask expressions that might give pain. Sixty-five
miles an hour? Through the Rockies?</p>

<p>But the postmaster-general struck the table quickly and heavily; he
didn't want to let it get away. "Why, hang it, Mr. Bucks," he exclaimed
with emphasis, "if you will say sixty, the business is done. We don't ask
you to do the Rockies in the time these fellows take to cut the
Alleghenies. Do sixty, and I will put mail in 'Frisco a day earlier every
week in the year."</p>

<p>"Nothing on the West End to keep you from doing it," said General
Manager Bucks. He had been put up then only about six months. "But
&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Every one looked at the young manager. The Pennsylvania man looked
with confidence, for he instantly suspected there must be a string to
such a proposition, or that the new representative was "talking through
his hat."</p>

<p>"But what?" asked the Cabinet member, uncomfortably apprehensive.</p>

<p>"But we are not putting on a sixty-five mile schedule just because we
love our country, you understand, nor to lighten an already glorious
reputation. Oh, no," smiled Bucks faintly, "we are doing it for 'the
stuff.' You put up the money; we put up the speed. Not sixty miles;
sixty-five &mdash; from the Missouri to the Sierras. No; no more wine.
Yes, thank you, I will take a cigar."</p>

<p>The trade was on from that minute. Bucks said no more then; he was a
good listener. But next day &mdash; when it came to talking money &mdash;
he talked more money into the West End treasury for one year's running
than was ever talked before on a mail contract for the best three years'
work we ever did.</p>

<p>When they asked him how much time he wanted to get ready, and told him
to take plenty, three months' were stipulated. The contracts were drawn,
and they were signed by our people without hesitation because they knew
Bucks. But while the preparations for the fast schedule were being made,
the Government weakened on signing. Nothing ever got through a Washington
department without hitch, and they said our road had so often failed on
like proposition that they wanted a test. There was a deal of wrangling,
then a test run was agreed upon by all the roads concerned. If it proved
successful &mdash; if the mail was put to the Golden Gate on the second
of the schedule &mdash; public opinion and the interests in the
Philippines, it was concluded, would justify the heavy premium asked for
the service.</p>

<p>In this way the dickering and the figuring became, in a measure,
public, and keyed up everybody interested to a high pitch. We said
nothing for publication, but under Bucks' energy sawed wood for three
whole months. Indeed, three months goes as a day getting a system into
shape for an extraordinary schedule. Success meant with us prestige; but
failure meant obloquy for the road and for our division chief who had
been so lately called to handle it.</p>

<p>The real strain, it was clear, would come on his old &mdash; the
mountain &mdash; division; and to carry out the point rested on the
motive power of the mountain division; hence, concretely, on Doubleday,
master mechanic of the hill country.</p>

<p>In thirty days Neighbor, superintendent of the motive power, called
for reports from the division master mechanics on the preparations for
the Yellow Mail run, and they reported progress. In sixty days he called
again. The subordinates reported well except Doubleday. Doubleday said
merely "Not ready"; he was busy tinkering with his engines. There was a
third call in eighty days, and on the eighty-fifth a peremptory call.
Everybody said ready except Doubleday. When Neighbor remonstrated
sharply, he would say only that he would be ready in time. That was the
most he would promise, though it was generally understood that if he
failed to deliver the goods he would have to make way for somebody who
could.</p>

<p>The plains division of the system was marked up for seventy miles an
hour, and, if the truth were told, a little better; but, with all the
help they could give us, it still left sixty for the mountains to take
care of, and the Yellow Mail proposition was conceded to be the toughest
affair the motive power at Medicine Bend ever faced. However, forty-eight
hours before the mail left the New York post-office Doubleday wired to
Neighbor, "Ready"; Neighbor to Bucks, "Ready"; and Bucks to Washington;
"Ready" and we were ready from end to end.</p>

<p>Then the orders began to shoot through the mountains. The test run was
of especial importance, because the signing of the contract was believed
to depend on the success of it. Once signed, accidents and delays might
be explained; for the test run there must be no delays. Despatches were
given the 11, which meant Bucks; no lay-outs, no slows for the Yellow
Mail. Road masters were notified: no trick work in front of the Yellow
Mail. Bridge gangs were warned, yard masters instructed, section bosses
cautioned, track walkers spurred &mdash; the system was polished like a
barkeeper's diamond, and swept like a parlor car for the test flight of
the Yellow Mail.</p>

<p>Doubleday, working like a boiler washer, spent all day Thursday and
all Thursday night in the roundhouse. He had personally gone over the
engines that were to take the racket in the mountains. Ten-wheelers they
were, the 1012 and the 1014, with fifty-six-inch drivers and cylinders
big enough to sit up and eat breakfast in. Spick and span both of them,
just long enough out of the shops to run smoothly to the work; and on
Friday Oliver Sollers, who, when he opened a throttle, blew miles over
the tender like feathers, took the 1012, groomed as you'd groom a Wilkes
mare, down to Piedmont for the run up to the Bend.</p>

<p>Now Oliver Sollers was a runner in a thousand, and steady as a clock;
but he had a fireman who couldn't stand prosperity, Steve Horigan, a
cousin of Johnnie's. The glory was too great for Steve, and he spent
Friday night in Gallagher's place celebrating, telling the boys what the
1012 would do to the Yellow Mail. Not a thing, Steve claimed after five
drinks, but pull the stamps clean off the letters the minute they struck
the foothills. But when Steve showed up at five A.M. to superintend the
movement, he was seasick. The instant Sollers set eyes on him he objected
to taking him out. Mr. Sollers was not looking for any unnecessary
chances on one of Bucks' personal matters, and for the general manager
the Yellow Mail test had become exceedingly personal. Practically
everybody East and West had said it would fail; Bucks said no.</p>

<p>Neighbor himself was on the Piedmont platform that morning, watching
things. The McCloud despatchers had promised the train to our division on
time, and her smoke was due with the rise of the sun. The big
superintendent of motive power, watching anxiously for her arrival, and
planning anxiously for her outgoing, glared at the bunged fireman in
front of him, and, when Sollers protested, Neighbor turned on the swollen
Steve with sorely bitter words. Steve swore mightily he was fit and could
do the trick &mdash; but what's the word of a railroad man that drinks.
Neighbor spoke wicked words, and while they poured on the guilty Steve's
crop there was a shout down the platform. In the east the sun was
breaking over the sandhills, and below it a haze of black thickened the
horizon. It was McTerza with the 808 and the Yellow Mail. Neighbor looked
at his watch; she was, if anything, a minute to the good, and before the
car tinks could hustle across the yard, a streak of gold cut the sea of
purple alfalfa in the lower valley, and the narrows began to smoke with
the dust of the race for the platform.</p>

<p>When McTerza blocked the big drivers at the west end of the depot,
every eye was on the new equipment. Three standard railway mail cars,
done in varnished buttercup, strung out behind the sizzling engine, and
they looked pretty as cowslips. While Neighbor vaguely meditated on their
beauty and on his boozing fireman, Jimmie Bradshaw, just in from a night
run down from the Bend, walked across the yard. He had just seen Steve
Horigan making a "sneak" for the bath-house, and from the yard gossip
Jimmie had guessed the rest.</p>

<p>"What are you looking for, Neighbor?" asked Jimmie Bradshaw.</p>

<p>"A man to fire for Sollers &mdash; up. Do you want it?"</p>

<p>Neighbor threw it at him across and carelessly, not having any idea
Jimmie was looking for trouble. But Jimmie surprised him; Jimmie did want
it.</p>

<p>"Sure, I want it. Put me on. Tired? No. I'm fresh as rainwater. Put me
on, Neighbor; I'll never get fast any other way. Doubleday wouldn't give
me a fast run in a hundred years. Neighbor," exclaimed Jimmie, greatly
wrought, "put me on, And I'll plant sunflowers on your grave."</p>

<p>There wasn't much time to look around; the 1011 was being coupled on
to the mail for the hardest run on the line.</p>

<p>"Get in there, you blamed idiot," roared Neighbor presently at Jimmie.
"Get in and fire her; and if you don't give Sollers 210 pounds every inch
of the way I'll set you back wiping."</p>

<p>Jimmie winked furiously at the proposition while it was being hurled
at him, but he lost no time climbing in. The 1017 was drumming then at
her gage with better than 200 pounds. Adam Shafer, conductor for the run,
ran backward and forward a minute examining the air. At the final word
from his brakeman he lifted two fingers at Sollers; Oliver opened a
notch, and Jimmie Bradshaw stuck his head out of the gangway. Slowly, but
with swiftly rising speed, the yellow string began to move out through
the long lines of freight cars that blocked the spurs; and those who
watched that morning from the Piedmont platform thought a smoother
equipment than Bucks' mail train never drew out of the mountain
yards.</p>

<p>Jimmie Bradshaw jumped at the work in front of him. He had never in
his life lifted a pick in as swell a cab as that. The hind end of the
1012 was as big as a private car; Jimmie had never seen so much play for
a shovel in his life, and he knew the trick of his business better than
most men even in West End cabs &mdash; the trick of holding the high
pressure every minute, of feeling the drafts before they left the
throttle; and as Oliver let the engine out very, very fast, Jimmie
Bradshaw sprinkled the grate bars craftily and blinked at the shivering
pointer, as much as to say, "It's you and me now for the Yellow Mail, and
nobody else on earth."</p>

<p>There was a long reach of smooth track in front of the foothills. It
was there the big start had to be made, and in two minutes the bark of
the big machine hail deepened to a chest tone full as thunder. It was all
fun for an hour, for two hours. It was that long before the ambitious
fireman realized what the new speed meant: the sickening slew, the lurch
on lurch so fast that the engine never righted, the shortened breath
along the tangent, the giddy roll to the elevation and the sudden shock
of the curve, the roar of the flight on the ear, and, above it all, the
booming purr of the maddened steel. The canoe in the heart of the rapids,
the bridge of a liner at sea, the gun in the heat of the fight, take
something of this &mdash; the cab of the mail takes it all.</p>

<p>When they struck the foothills, Sollers and Jimmie Bradshaw looked at
their watches and looked at each other, but like men who had turned their
backs on every mountain record. There was a stop for water &mdash; speed
drinks so hard &mdash; an oil round, an anxious touch on the journals;
then the Yellow Mail drew reeling into the hills. Oliver eased her just a
bit for the heavier curves, but for all that the train writhed
frantically as it cut the segments, and the men thought, in spite of
themselves, of the mountain curves ahead. The worst of the run lay ahead
of the pilot, because the art in mountain running is not alone or so much
in getting up hill; it is in getting down hill. But by the way the Yellow
Mail got that day up hill and down, it seemed as if Steve Horigan's dream
would be realized and that the 1012 actually would pull the stamps off
the letters. Before they knew it they were through the gateway, out into
the desert country, up along the crested buttes, and then, sudden as
eternity the wheel-base of the 1012 struck a tight curve, a pent-down
rail sprang out like a knitting-needle, and the Yellow Mail shot
staggering off the track into a gray borrow-pit.</p>

<p>There was a crunching of truck and frame, a crashing splinter of
varnished cars, a scream from the wounded engine, a cloud of gray ash in
the burning sun, and a ruin of human effort in the ditch. In the twinkle
of an eye the mail train lay spilled on the alkali; for a minute it
looked desperately bad for the general manager's test.</p>

<p>It was hardly more than a minute, tho, then like ants from out a
trampled hill men began crawling from the yellow wreck. There was more
&mdash; there was groaning and worse, yet little for so frightful a
shock. And first on his feet, with no more than scratches, and quickest
back under the cab after his engineer, was Jimmie Bradshaw, the
fireman.</p>

<p>Sollers, barely conscious, lay wedged between the tank and the
footboard. Jimmie, all by himself, eased him away from the boiler. The
conductor stood with a broken arm directing his brakeman how to chop a
crew out of the head mail car, and the hind crews were getting out
themselves. There was a quick calling back and forth, and the cry,
"Nobody killed!"</p>

<p>But the engineer and conductor were put out of action. There was, in
fact, but one West End man unhurt; yet that was enough &mdash; for it was
Jimmie Bradshaw.</p>

<p>The first wreck of the fast mail &mdash; there had been worse since
&mdash; took place just east of Crockett's siding. A west-bound freight
lay at that moment on the passing track waiting for the mail. Jimmie
Bradshaw cast up the possibilities of the situation the minute he righted
himself.</p>

<p>Before the freight crew had reached the wreck, Jimmie was hustling
ahead to tell them what he wanted. The freight conductor demurred; and
when they discussed it with the freight engineer, Kingsley, he objected.
"My engine won't never stand it; it'll pound her to pieces," he argued.
"I reckon the safest thing to do is to get orders."</p>

<p>"Get orders!" stormed Jimmie Bradshaw, pointing at the wreck, "Get
orders! Are you running an engine on this line and don't know the orders
for those mail bags? The orders is to move 'em! That's orders enough.
Move 'em! Uncouple three of those empty box-cars and hustle 'em back. By
the Great United States! any man that interferes with the moving of this
mail will get his time &mdash; that's what he'll get. That's Doubleday,
and don't you forget it. The thing is to move the mail &mdash; not stand
here chewing about it!"</p>

<p>"Bucks wants the stuff hustled," put in the freight conductor,
weakening before Jimmies eloquence. "Everybody knows that."</p>

<p>"Uncouple there!" cried Jimmie, climbing into the Mogul cab. "I'll
pull the bags, Kingsley; you needn't take any chances. Come back there,
every mother's son of you, and help on the transfer."</p>

<p>He carried his points with a gale. He was conductor and engineer and
general manager all in one. He backed the boxes to the curve below the
spill, and set every man at work piling the mail from the wrecked train
to the freight cars. The wounded cared for the wounded, and the dead
might have buried the dead; Jimmie moved the mail. Only one thing turned
his hair gray; the transfer was so slow, it looked as if it would defeat
his plan. As he stood fermenting, a stray party of Sioux bucks on a
vagrant hunt rose out of the desert passes, and halted to survey the
confusion. It was Jimmie Bradshaw's opportunity. He had the blanket men
in council in a trice. They talked for one minute, in two he had them
regularly sworn in and carrying second-class. The registered stuff was
jealously guarded by those of the mail clerks who could still hobble
&mdash; and who, head for head, leg for leg, and arm for arm, can stand
the wrecking that a mail clerk can stand? The mail crews took the
registered matter; the freight crews and Jimmie, dripping sweat and
anxiety, handled the letter bags; but second and third class were
temporarily hustled for the Great White Father by his irreverent children
of the Rockies.</p>

<p>Before the disabled men could credit their senses the business was
done, themselves made as comfortable as possible, and with the promise of
speedy aid back to the injured, the Yellow Mail, somewhat disfigured, was
again heading westward in the box-cars. This time Jimmie Bradshaw, like a
dog with a bone, had the throttle. Jimmie Bradshaw for once in his life
had the coveted fast run, and till he sighted Fort Rucker he never for a
minute let up.</p>

<p>Meantime there was a desperate crowd round the despatches at Medicine
Bend. It was an hour and twenty minutes after Ponca Station reported the
Yellow Mail out, before Fort Rucker, eighteen miles farther west,
reported the box-cars and Jimmie Bradshaw in, and followed with a wreck
report from the Crockett siding. When that end of it began to tumble into
the Wickiup office Doubleday's face went very hard &mdash; fate was
against him, the contract was gone glimmering, he didn't feel at all sure
his own head and the roadmaster's wouldn't follow it. Then the Rucker
operator began again to talk about Jimmie Bradshaw, and "Who's Bradshaw?"
asked somebody; and Rucker went on excitedly with the story of the Mogul
and of three box-cars, and of a war party of Sioux squatting on the
brake-wheels; it came so mixed that Medicine Bend thought everybody at
Rucker Station had gone mad.</p>

<p>While they fumed, Jimmie Bradshaw was speeding the mail through the
mountains. He had Kingsley's fireman, big as an ox and full of his own
enthusiasm. In no time they were flying across the flats of the Spider
Water, threading the curves of the Peace River, and hitting the rails of
the Painted Desert, with the Mogul sprinting like a Texas steer, and the
box-cars leaping like yearlings at the points. It was no case of
scientific running, no case of favoring the roadbed, of easing the strain
on the equipment; it was simply a case of galloping to a Broadway fire
with a Silsby rotary on a 4-11 call. Up hill and down, curve and tangent,
it was all one. There was speed made on the plains with that mail, and
there was speed made in the foothills with the fancy equipment, but never
the speed that Jimmie Bradshaw made when he ran the mail through the
gorges in three box-cars; and frightened operators and paralyzed
station-agents all the way up the line watched the fearful and wonderful
train jump the switches with Bradshaw's red head sticking out of the cab
window.</p>

<p>Medicine Bend couldn't get the straight of it over the wires. There
was an electric storm in the mountains, and the wires went bad in the
midst of the confusion. They knew there was a wreck, and supposed there
was mail in the ditch, and, with Doubleday frantic, the despatchers were
trying to get the track to run a train down to Crockett's. But Jimmie
Bradshaw had asked at Rucker for rights to the Bend, and in an unguarded
moment they had been given; after that it was all off. Nobody could get
action on Jimmie Bradshaw to head him off. He took the rights, and stayed
not for stake and stopped not for stone. In thirty minutes the operating
department was ready to kill him, but he was making such time it was
concluded better to humor the lunatic than to try to hold him up anywhere
for a parley. When this was decided Jimmie and his war party were already
reported past Bad Axe, fifteen miles below the Bend, with every truck on
the box-cars smoking.</p>

<p>The Bad Axe run to the Bend was never done in less than fourteen
minutes until Bradshaw that day brought up the mail. Between those two
points the line is modeled on the curves of a ram's horn, but Jimmie with
the Mogul found every twist on the right of way in eleven minutes; that
particular record is good yet. Indeed, before Doubleday, then in a
frenzied condition, got his cohorts fairly on the platform to look for
Jimmie, the hollow scream of the big freight engine echoed through the
mountains. Shouts from below brought the operators to the upper windows;
down the Bend they saw a monster locomotive flying from a trailing horn
of smoke. As the stubby string of freight cars slewed quartering into the
lower yard, the startled officials saw them from the Wickfup windows
wrapped in a stream of flame. Every journal was afire, and the blaze from
the hoses, rolling into the steam from the stack, curled hotly around a
bevy of Sioux Indians, who clung sternly to the foot-boards and
brake-wheels on top of the box-cars. It was a ride for the red men that
is told around the council fires yet. But they do not always add in their
traditions that they were hanging on, not only for life, but also for a
butt of plug tobacco promised for their timely help at Crockett
siding.</p>

<p>By the time Jimmie slowed up his amazing equipment the fire brigade
was on the run from the roundhouse. The Sioux warriors climbed hastily
down the fire escapes, a force of bruised and bareheaded mail clerks
shoved back the box-car doors, the car tinks tackled the conflagration,
and Jimmie Bradshaw, dropping from the cab with the swing of a man who
has done it, waited at the gangway for the questions to come to him, and
for a minute they came hot.</p>

<p>"What the blazes do you mean by bringing in an engine in that
condition?" yelled Doubleday, pointing to the blown machine.</p>

<p>"I thought you wanted the mail," winked Jimmie.</p>

<p>"How the devil are we to get the mail with you blocking the track for
two hours?" demanded Calahan insanely.</p>

<p>"Why, the mail's here &mdash; in these box-cars," responded Jimmie
Bradshaw, pointing to his bobtail train. "Now don't look daffy like that;
every sack is right here. I thought the best way to get the mail here was
to bring it. Hm! We're forty minutes late, ain't we?"</p>

<p>Doubleday waited to hear no more. Orders flew like curlews from the
superintendent and the master mechanic. They saw there was a life for it
yet. A string of new mail cars was backed down beside the train before
the fire brigade had done with the tracks. The relieving mail crews
waiting at the Bend took hold like cats at a pudding, and a dozen extra
men helped them sling the pouches. The 1014, blowing porpoise-wise, was
backed up just as Benedict Morgan's train pulled down for Crockett's
siding, and the Yellow Mail, rehabilitated, rejuvenated, and exultant,
started up the gorge for Bear Dance, only fifty-three minutes late, with
Hawksworth in the cab.</p>

<p>"And if you can't make that up, Frank, you're no good on earth,"
sputtered Doubleday at the engineer he had put in for that special
endeavor. And Frank Hawksworth did make it up, and the Yellow Mail went
on and off the West End on the test, and into the Sierras for the coast,
on time.</p>

<p>"There's a butt of plug tobacco and transportation to Crockett's
coming to these bucks, Mr. Doubleday," winked Jimmie Bradshaw
uncertainly, for with the wearing off of the strain came the idea to
Jimmie that he might have to pay for it himself. "I promised them that,"
he added, "for helping with the transfer. If it hadn't been for the
blankets we wouldn't have got off for another hour. They chew Tomahawk
&mdash; rough and ready preferred &mdash; Mr. Doubleday. Hm!"</p>

<p>Doubleday was looking off into the mountains.</p>

<p>"You've been on a freight run some time, Jimmie," said he tentatively
after a while.</p>

<p>The Indian detachment was crowding in pretty close on the red-headed
engineer. He blushed. "If you'll take care of my tobacco contract,
Doubleday, we'll call the other matter square. I'm not looking for a fast
run as much as I was."</p>

<p>"If we get the mail contract," resumed Doubleday reflectively, "and it
won't be your fault if we don't &mdash; hm! &mdash; we may need you on
one of the runs. Looks to me like you ought to have one."</p>

<p>Jimmie shook his head. "I don't want one &mdash; don't mind me; just
fix these gentlemen out with some tobacco before they scalp me, will
you?"</p>

<p>The Indians got their leaf, and Bucks got his contract, and Jimmie
Bradshaw got the pick of the runs on the Yellow Mail, and ever since he's
been kicking to get back on a freight. But they don't call him Bradshaw
any more. No man in the mountains can pace him on a dare-devil run. And
when the head brave of the hunting party received the butt of tobacco on
behalf of his company, he looked at Doubleday with dignity, pointed to
the sandy engineer, and spoke freckled words in the Sioux.</p>

<p>That's the way it came about. Bradshaw holds the belt for the run from
Bad Axe to Medicine Bend; but he never goes by the name of Bradshaw any
more. West of McCloyd; everywhere up and down the mountains, they give
him the name that the Sioux gave him that day Jimmie the Wind.</p>
