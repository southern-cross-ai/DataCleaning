"Lift up your swags and follow me!
Take up your swags and follow me!
Hark to the Bush a-calling:
Follow me, follow me home!"

&mdash;From <a href=

                Swags up!

Swags up! and yet I turn upon the way.
  The yellow hill against a dapple sky,
  With tufts and clumps of thorn, the bush whereby
All through the wonder-pregnant night I lay
Until the silver stars were merged in grey
  --Our fragrant camp--demand a parting sigh:
  New tracks, new camps, and hearts for ever high,
Yet brief regret with every welcome day.

Dear dreamy earth, receding flickering lamp,
  Dear dust wherein I found this night a home,
    Still for a memory's sake I turn and cling,
Then take the road for many a distant camp,
  Among what hills, by what pale whispering foam,
    With eager faith for ever wandering.

--John Le Gay Brereton

<p>In <i>The Ways of the Bushwalker, On Foot in Australia</i> by
Melissa Harper (UNSW Press, 2007), we find that as early as May
1788, about four months after the arrival in Australia of the First
Fleet, some of the people were walking for pleasure. In a letter to
his brother in England, George Worgan, surgeon to the inhabitants
of the fledgling colony of New South wales, wrote:</p>

<p><i>"We sometimes, put a Bit of Salt Beef or Pork, Bisket, a
Bottle of O be joyful, in a Snapsack throw it over our Backs, take
a Hatchet, a Brace of Pistols, and a Musket, and away we go,
scouring the Woods, sometimes East, West, N.S. if Night overtakes
us, we light up a rousing Fire, Cut Boughs &amp; make up a Wig-Wam,
open our Wallets, and eat as hearty of our Fare as You, of your
Dainties, then lie down on a Bed, which tho' not of Roses, yet we
sleep as sound as You do, on down; I enjoy these little Rambles,
and I think you would, however, I think it is hardly worth your
while to come and try them.'"</i>
</p>

<p>We have gathered together some books by walkers and some books
about walking, which we hope you will enjoy.</p>

(1899) by John Le Gay Brereton</td>
<td style="height: 63px">A charming tale of a walk of about one
month's duration during March and April. Two travellers set out
from Sydney, crossed the Blue Mountains and returned to Sydney via
the Jenolan Caves, Mount Werong, Wombeyan Caves, Berrima and Kiama.
The book is littered with drawings and scraps of verse.</td>

<td>In the early 1900s Hamlet walked twice from Brisbane to Sydney
and once from Sydney to Melbourne, each walk taking about a month.
The accounts of his walks were serialised in the <i>Sydney Morning
Herald</i>.&nbsp; Those accounts, gathered together here, give a
lively commentary on his trips and provide us with a picture of the
south east coast of Australia as it was more than 100 years
ago.</td>

and Billy: A Guide to Walking Trips in Tourist Districts of New
South Wales</i></a> (1910) by H. J. Tompkins</td>
<td>This booklet was published by the New South Wales government
Tourist Bureau. It describes many walks or varying duration. In the
details provided in a number of the trips, reference is made to the
<i>boat</i> meeting the train at Milson's point, or at Circular
Quay. To which <i>boat</i> is the author referring? Upon
reflection, one realises that he is referring to the <i>boat</i>
which plied between Circular Quay and Milson's point, ferrying
passengers to and fro across Sydney Harbour so that they could
catch a train on the other side. There was, of course, no bridge
spanning the harbour at the time the book was written.</td>
