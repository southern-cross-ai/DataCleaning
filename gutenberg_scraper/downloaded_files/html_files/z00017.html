<h2>Author's Note</h2>

<p>My friends the children are responsible for this new "Oz Book,"
as they were for the last one, which was called The Land of Oz.
Their sweet little letters plead to know "more about Dorothy"; and
they ask: "What became of the Cowardly Lion?" and "What did Ozma do
afterward?"&mdash;meaning, of course, after she became the Ruler of
Oz. And some of them suggest plots to me, saying: "Please have
Dorothy go to the Land of Oz again"; or, "Why don't you make Ozma
and Dorothy meet, and have a good time together?" Indeed, could I
do all that my little friends ask, I would be obliged to write
dozens of books to satisfy their demands. And I wish I could, for I
enjoy writing these stories just as much as the children say they
enjoy reading them.</p>

<p>Well, here is "more about Dorothy," and about our old friends
the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, and about the Cowardly Lion, and
Ozma, and all the rest of them; and here, likewise, is a good deal
about some new folks that are queer and unusual. One little friend,
who read this story before it was printed, said to me: "Billina is
REAL OZZY, Mr. Baum, and so are Tiktok and the Hungry Tiger."</p>

<p>If this judgment is unbiased and correct, and the little folks
find this new story "real Ozzy," I shall be very glad indeed that I
wrote it. But perhaps I shall get some more of those very welcome
letters from my readers, telling me just how they like "Ozma of
Oz." I hope so, anyway.</p>

<p>L. FRANK BAUM.<br>
MACATAWA, 1907.</p>

<h2>1. The Girl in the Chicken Coop</h2>

<p>The wind blew hard and joggled the water of the ocean, sending
ripples across its surface. Then the wind pushed the edges of the
ripples until they became waves, and shoved the waves around until
they became billows. The billows rolled dreadfully high: higher
even than the tops of houses. Some of them, indeed, rolled as high
as the tops of tall trees, and seemed like mountains; and the gulfs
between the great billows were like deep valleys.</p>

<p>All this mad dashing and splashing of the waters of the big
ocean, which the mischievous wind caused without any good reason
whatever, resulted in a terrible storm, and a storm on the ocean is
liable to cut many queer pranks and do a lot of damage.</p>

<p>At the time the wind began to blow, a ship was sailing far out
upon the waters. When the waves began to tumble and toss and to
grow bigger and bigger the ship rolled up and down, and tipped
sidewise&mdash;first one way and then the other&mdash;and was
jostled around so roughly that even the sailor-men had to hold fast
to the ropes and railings to keep themselves from being swept away
by the wind or pitched headlong into the sea.</p>

<p>And the clouds were so thick in the sky that the sunlight
couldn't get through them; so that the day grew dark as night,
which added to the terrors of the storm.</p>

<p>The Captain of the ship was not afraid, because he had seen
storms before, and had sailed his ship through them in safety; but
he knew that his passengers would be in danger if they tried to
stay on deck, so he put them all into the cabin and told them to
stay there until after the storm was over, and to keep brave hearts
and not be scared, and all would be well with them.</p>

<p>Now, among these passengers was a little Kansas girl named
Dorothy Gale, who was going with her Uncle Henry to Australia, to
visit some relatives they had never before seen. Uncle Henry, you
must know, was not very well, because he had been working so hard
on his Kansas farm that his health had given way and left him weak
and nervous. So he left Aunt Em at home to watch after the hired
men and to take care of the farm, while he traveled far away to
Australia to visit his cousins and have a good rest.</p>

<p>Dorothy was eager to go with him on this journey, and Uncle
Henry thought she would be good company and help cheer him up; so
he decided to take her along. The little girl was quite an
experienced traveller, for she had once been carried by a cyclone
as far away from home as the marvelous Land of Oz, and she had met
with a good many adventures in that strange country before she
managed to get back to Kansas again. So she wasn't easily
frightened, whatever happened, and when the wind began to howl and
whistle, and the waves began to tumble and toss, our little girl
didn't mind the uproar the least bit.</p>

<p>"Of course we'll have to stay in the cabin," she said to Uncle
Henry and the other passengers, "and keep as quiet as possible
until the storm is over. For the Captain says if we go on deck we
may be blown overboard."</p>

<p>No one wanted to risk such an accident as that, you may be sure;
so all the passengers stayed huddled up in the dark cabin,
listening to the shrieking of the storm and the creaking of the
masts and rigging and trying to keep from bumping into one another
when the ship tipped sidewise.</p>

<p>Dorothy had almost fallen asleep when she was aroused with a
start to find that Uncle Henry was missing. She couldn't imagine
where he had gone, and as he was not very strong she began to worry
about him, and to fear he might have been careless enough to go on
deck. In that case he would be in great danger unless he instantly
came down again.</p>

<p>The fact was that Uncle Henry had gone to lie down in his little
sleeping-berth, but Dorothy did not know that. She only remembered
that Aunt Em had cautioned her to take good care of her uncle, so
at once she decided to go on deck and find him, in spite of the
fact that the tempest was now worse than ever, and the ship was
plunging in a really dreadful manner. Indeed, the little girl found
it was as much as she could do to mount the stairs to the deck, and
as soon as she got there the wind struck her so fiercely that it
almost tore away the skirts of her dress. Yet Dorothy felt a sort
of joyous excitement in defying the storm, and while she held fast
to the railing she peered around through the gloom and thought she
saw the dim form of a man clinging to a mast not far away from her.
This might be her uncle, so she called as loudly as she could:</p>

<p>"Uncle Henry! Uncle Henry!"</p>

<p>But the wind screeched and howled so madly that she scarce heard
her own voice, and the man certainly failed to hear her, for he did
not move.</p>

<p>Dorothy decided she must go to him; so she made a dash forward,
during a lull in the storm, to where a big square chicken-coop had
been lashed to the deck with ropes. She reached this place in
safety, but no sooner had she seized fast hold of the slats of the
big box in which the chickens were kept than the wind, as if
enraged because the little girl dared to resist its power, suddenly
redoubled its fury. With a scream like that of an angry giant it
tore away the ropes that held the coop and lifted it high into the
air, with Dorothy still clinging to the slats. Around and over it
whirled, this way and that, and a few moments later the
chicken-coop dropped far away into the sea, where the big waves
caught it and slid it up-hill to a foaming crest and then down-hill
into a deep valley, as if it were nothing more than a plaything to
keep them amused.</p>

<p>Dorothy had a good ducking, you may be sure, but she didn't lose
her presence of mind even for a second. She kept tight hold of the
stout slats and as soon as she could get the water out of her eyes
she saw that the wind had ripped the cover from the coop, and the
poor chickens were fluttering away in every direction, being blown
by the wind until they looked like feather dusters without handles.
The bottom of the coop was made of thick boards, so Dorothy found
she was clinging to a sort of raft, with sides of slats, which
readily bore up her weight. After coughing the water out of her
throat and getting her breath again, she managed to climb over the
slats and stand upon the firm wooden bottom of the coop, which
supported her easily enough.</p>

<p>"Why, I've got a ship of my own!" she thought, more amused than
frightened at her sudden change of condition; and then, as the coop
climbed up to the top of a big wave, she looked eagerly around for
the ship from which she had been blown.</p>

<p>It was far, far away, by this time. Perhaps no one on board had
yet missed her, or knew of her strange adventure. Down into a
valley between the waves the coop swept her, and when she climbed
another crest the ship looked like a toy boat, it was such a long
way off. Soon it had entirely disappeared in the gloom, and then
Dorothy gave a sigh of regret at parting with Uncle Henry and began
to wonder what was going to happen to her next.</p>

<p>Just now she was tossing on the bosom of a big ocean, with
nothing to keep her afloat but a miserable wooden hen-coop that had
a plank bottom and slatted sides, through which the water
constantly splashed and wetted her through to the skin! And there
was nothing to eat when she became hungry&mdash;as she was sure to
do before long&mdash;and no fresh water to drink and no dry clothes
to put on.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" she exclaimed, with a laugh. "You're in a
pretty fix, Dorothy Gale, I can tell you! and I haven't the least
idea how you're going to get out of it!"</p>

<p>As if to add to her troubles the night was now creeping on, and
the gray clouds overhead changed to inky blackness. But the wind,
as if satisfied at last with its mischievous pranks, stopped
blowing this ocean and hurried away to another part of the world to
blow something else; so that the waves, not being joggled any more,
began to quiet down and behave themselves.</p>

<p>It was lucky for Dorothy, I think, that the storm subsided;
otherwise, brave though she was, I fear she might have perished.
Many children, in her place, would have wept and given way to
despair; but because Dorothy had encountered so many adventures and
come safely through them it did not occur to her at this time to be
especially afraid. She was wet and uncomfortable, it is true; but,
after sighing that one sigh I told you of, she managed to recall
some of her customary cheerfulness and decided to patiently await
whatever her fate might be.</p>

<p>By and by the black clouds rolled away and showed a blue sky
overhead, with a silver moon shining sweetly in the middle of it
and little stars winking merrily at Dorothy when she looked their
way. The coop did not toss around any more, but rode the waves more
gently&mdash;almost like a cradle rocking&mdash;so that the floor
upon which Dorothy stood was no longer swept by water coming
through the slats. Seeing this, and being quite exhausted by the
excitement of the past few hours, the little girl decided that
sleep would be the best thing to restore her strength and the
easiest way in which she could pass the time. The floor was damp
and she was herself wringing wet, but fortunately this was a warm
climate and she did not feel at all cold.</p>

<p>So she sat down in a corner of the coop, leaned her back against
the slats, nodded at the friendly stars before she closed her eyes,
and was asleep in half a minute.</p>

<h2>2. The Yellow Hen</h2>

<p>A strange noise awoke Dorothy, who opened her eyes to find that
day had dawned and the sun was shining brightly in a clear sky. She
had been dreaming that she was back in Kansas again, and playing in
the old barn-yard with the calves and pigs and chickens all around
her; and at first, as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes, she
really imagined she was there.</p>

<p>"Kut-kut-kut, ka-daw-kut! Kut-kut-kut, ka-daw-kut!"</p>

<p>Ah; here again was the strange noise that had awakened her.
Surely it was a hen cackling! But her wide-open eyes first saw,
through the slats of the coop, the blue waves of the ocean, now
calm and placid, and her thoughts flew back to the past night, so
full of danger and discomfort. Also she began to remember that she
was a waif of the storm, adrift upon a treacherous and unknown
sea.</p>

<p>"Kut-kut-kut, ka-daw-w-w&mdash;kut!"</p>

<p>"What's that?" cried Dorothy, starting to her feet.</p>

<p>"Why, I've just laid an egg, that's all," replied a small, but
sharp and distinct voice, and looking around her the little girl
discovered a yellow hen squatting in the opposite corner of the
coop.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" she exclaimed, in surprise; "have YOU been here all
night, too?"</p>

<p>"Of course," answered the hen, fluttering her wings and yawning.
"When the coop blew away from the ship I clung fast to this corner,
with claws and beak, for I knew if I fell into the water I'd surely
be drowned. Indeed, I nearly drowned, as it was, with all that
water washing over me. I never was so wet before in my life!"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Dorothy, "it was pretty wet, for a time, I know.
But do you feel comfor'ble now?"</p>

<p>"Not very. The sun has helped to dry my feathers, as it has your
dress, and I feel better since I laid my morning egg. But what's to
become of us, I should like to know, afloat on this big pond?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to know that, too," said Dorothy. "But, tell me; how
does it happen that you are able to talk? I thought hens could only
cluck and cackle."</p>

<p>"Why, as for that," answered the yellow hen thoughtfully, "I've
clucked and cackled all my life, and never spoken a word before
this morning, that I can remember. But when you asked a question, a
minute ago, it seemed the most natural thing in the world to answer
you. So I spoke, and I seem to keep on speaking, just as you and
other human beings do. Strange, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Very," replied Dorothy. "If we were in the Land of Oz, I
wouldn't think it so queer, because many of the animals can talk in
that fairy country. But out here in the ocean must be a good long
way from Oz."</p>

<p>"How is my grammar?" asked the yellow hen, anxiously. "Do I
speak quite properly, in your judgment?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dorothy, "you do very well, for a beginner."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to know that," continued the yellow hen, in a
confidential tone; "because, if one is going to talk, it's best to
talk correctly. The red rooster has often said that my cluck and my
cackle were quite perfect; and now it's a comfort to know I am
talking properly."</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to get hungry," remarked Dorothy. "It's breakfast
time; but there's no breakfast."</p>

<p>"You may have my egg," said the yellow hen. "I don't care for
it, you know."</p>

<p>"Don't you want to hatch it?" asked the little girl, in
surprise.</p>

<p>"No, indeed; I never care to hatch eggs unless I've a nice snug
nest, in some quiet place, with a baker's dozen of eggs under me.
That's thirteen, you know, and it's a lucky number for hens. So you
may as well eat this egg."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't POSS'BLY eat it, unless it was cooked,"
exclaimed Dorothy. "But I'm much obliged for your kindness, just
the same."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it, my dear," answered the hen, calmly, and began
preening her feathers.</p>

<p>For a moment Dorothy stood looking out over the wide sea. She
was still thinking of the egg, though; so presently she asked:</p>

<p>"Why do you lay eggs, when you don't expect to hatch them?"</p>

<p>"It's a habit I have," replied the yellow hen. "It has always
been my pride to lay a fresh egg every morning, except when I'm
moulting. I never feel like having my morning cackle till the egg
is properly laid, and without the chance to cackle I would not be
happy."</p>

<p>"It's strange," said the girl, reflectively; "but as I'm not a
hen I can't be 'spected to understand that."</p>

<p>"Certainly not, my dear."</p>

<p>Then Dorothy fell silent again. The yellow hen was some company,
and a bit of comfort, too; but it was dreadfully lonely out on the
big ocean, nevertheless.</p>

<p>After a time the hen flew up and perched upon the topmost slat
of the coop, which was a little above Dorothy's head when she was
sitting upon the bottom, as she had been doing for some moments
past.</p>

<p>"Why, we are not far from land!" exclaimed the hen.</p>

<p>"Where? Where is it?" cried Dorothy, jumping up in great
excitement.</p>

<p>"Over there a little way," answered the hen, nodding her head in
a certain direction. "We seem to be drifting toward it, so that
before noon we ought to find ourselves upon dry land again."</p>

<p>"I shall like that!" said Dorothy, with a little sigh, for her
feet and legs were still wetted now and then by the sea-water that
came through the open slats.</p>

<p>"So shall I," answered her companion. "There is nothing in the
world so miserable as a wet hen."</p>

<p>The land, which they seemed to be rapidly approaching, since it
grew more distinct every minute, was quite beautiful as viewed by
the little girl in the floating hen-coop. Next to the water was a
broad beach of white sand and gravel, and farther back were several
rocky hills, while beyond these appeared a strip of green trees
that marked the edge of a forest. But there were no houses to be
seen, nor any sign of people who might inhabit this unknown
land.</p>

<p>"I hope we shall find something to eat," said Dorothy, looking
eagerly at the pretty beach toward which they drifted. "It's long
past breakfast time, now."</p>

<p>"I'm a trifle hungry, myself," declared the yellow hen.</p>

<p>"Why don't you eat the egg?" asked the child. "You don't need to
have your food cooked, as I do."</p>

<p>"Do you take me for a cannibal?" cried the hen, indignantly. "I
do not know what I have said or done that leads you to insult
me!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, I'm sure Mrs.&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;by the way,
may I inquire your name, ma'am?" asked the little girl.</p>

<p>"My name is Bill," said the yellow hen, somewhat gruffly.</p>

<p>"Bill! Why, that's a boy's name."</p>

<p>"What difference does that make?"</p>

<p>"You're a lady hen, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course. But when I was first hatched out no one could tell
whether I was going to be a hen or a rooster; so the little boy at
the farm where I was born called me Bill, and made a pet of me
because I was the only yellow chicken in the whole brood. When I
grew up, and he found that I didn't crow and fight, as all the
roosters do, he did not think to change my name, and every creature
in the barn-yard, as well as the people in the house, knew me as
'Bill.' So Bill I've always been called, and Bill is my name."</p>

<p>"But it's all wrong, you know," declared Dorothy, earnestly;
"and, if you don't mind, I shall call you 'Billina.' Putting the
'eena' on the end makes it a girl's name, you see."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind it in the least," returned the yellow hen. "It
doesn't matter at all what you call me, so long as I know the name
means ME."</p>

<p>"Very well, Billina. MY name is Dorothy Gale&mdash;just Dorothy
to my friends and Miss Gale to strangers. You may call me Dorothy,
if you like. We're getting very near the shore. Do you suppose it
is too deep for me to wade the rest of the way?"</p>

<p>"Wait a few minutes longer. The sunshine is warm and pleasant,
and we are in no hurry."</p>

<p>"But my feet are all wet and soggy," said the girl. "My dress is
dry enough, but I won't feel real comfor'ble till I get my feet
dried."</p>

<p>She waited, however, as the hen advised, and before long the big
wooden coop grated gently on the sandy beach and the dangerous
voyage was over.</p>

<p>It did not take the castaways long to reach the shore, you may
be sure. The yellow hen flew to the sands at once, but Dorothy had
to climb over the high slats. Still, for a country girl, that was
not much of a feat, and as soon as she was safe ashore Dorothy drew
off her wet shoes and stockings and spread them upon the sun-warmed
beach to dry.</p>

<p>Then she sat down and watched Billina, who was pick-pecking away
with her sharp bill in the sand and gravel, which she scratched up
and turned over with her strong claws.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Getting my breakfast, of course," murmured the hen, busily
pecking away.</p>

<p>"What do you find?" inquired the girl, curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, some fat red ants, and some sand-bugs, and once in a while
a tiny crab. They are very sweet and nice, I assure you."</p>

<p>"How dreadful!" exclaimed Dorothy, in a shocked voice.</p>

<p>"What is dreadful?" asked the hen, lifting her head to gaze with
one bright eye at her companion.</p>

<p>"Why, eating live things, and horrid bugs, and crawly ants. You
ought to be 'SHAMED of yourself!"</p>

<p>"Goodness me!" returned the hen, in a puzzled tone; "how queer
you are, Dorothy! Live things are much fresher and more wholesome
than dead ones, and you humans eat all sorts of dead
creatures."</p>

<p>"We don't!" said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"You do, indeed," answered Billina. "You eat lambs and sheep and
cows and pigs and even chickens."</p>

<p>"But we cook 'em," said Dorothy, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"What difference does that make?"</p>

<p>"A good deal," said the girl, in a graver tone. "I can't just
'splain the diff'rence, but it's there. And, anyhow, we never eat
such dreadful things as BUGS."</p>

<p>"But you eat the chickens that eat the bugs," retorted the
yellow hen, with an odd cackle. "So you are just as bad as we
chickens are."</p>

<p>This made Dorothy thoughtful. What Billina said was true enough,
and it almost took away her appetite for breakfast. As for the
yellow hen, she continued to peck away at the sand busily, and
seemed quite contented with her bill-of-fare.</p>

<p>Finally, down near the water's edge, Billina stuck her bill deep
into the sand, and then drew back and shivered.</p>

<p>"Ow!" she cried. "I struck metal, that time, and it nearly broke
my beak."</p>

<p>"It prob'bly was a rock," said Dorothy, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Nonsense. I know a rock from metal, I guess," said the hen.
"There's a different feel to it."</p>

<p>"But there couldn't be any metal on this wild, deserted
seashore," persisted the girl. "Where's the place? I'll dig it up,
and prove to you I'm right."</p>

<p>Billina showed her the place where she had "stubbed her bill,"
as she expressed it, and Dorothy dug away the sand until she felt
something hard. Then, thrusting in her hand, she pulled the thing
out, and discovered it to be a large sized golden key&mdash;rather
old, but still bright and of perfect shape.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?" cried the hen, with a cackle of triumph.
"Can I tell metal when I bump into it, or is the thing a rock?"</p>

<p>"It's metal, sure enough," answered the child, gazing
thoughtfully at the curious thing she had found. "I think it is
pure gold, and it must have lain hidden in the sand for a long
time. How do you suppose it came there, Billina? And what do you
suppose this mysterious key unlocks?"</p>

<p>"I can't say," replied the hen. "You ought to know more about
locks and keys than I do."</p>

<p>Dorothy glanced around. There was no sign of any house in that
part of the country, and she reasoned that every key must fit a
lock and every lock must have a purpose. Perhaps the key had been
lost by somebody who lived far away, but had wandered on this very
shore.</p>

<p>Musing on these things the girl put the key in the pocket of her
dress and then slowly drew on her shoes and stockings, which the
sun had fully dried.</p>

<p>"I b'lieve, Billina," she said, "I'll have a look 'round, and
see if I can find some breakfast."</p>

<h2>3. Letters in the Sand</h2>

<p>Walking a little way back from the water's edge, toward the
grove of trees, Dorothy came to a flat stretch of white sand that
seemed to have queer signs marked upon its surface, just as one
would write upon sand with a stick.</p>

<p>"What does it say?" she asked the yellow hen, who trotted along
beside her in a rather dignified fashion.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" returned the hen. "I cannot read."</p>

<p>"Oh! Can't you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; I've never been to school, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, I have," admitted Dorothy; "but the letters are big and
far apart, and it's hard to spell out the words."</p>

<p>But she looked at each letter carefully, and finally discovered
that these words were written in the sand:</p>

<p>"BEWARE THE WHEELERS!"</p>

<p>"That's rather strange," declared the hen, when Dorothy had read
aloud the words. "What do you suppose the Wheelers are?"</p>

<p>"Folks that wheel, I guess. They must have wheelbarrows, or
baby-cabs or hand-carts," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they're automobiles," suggested the yellow hen. "There
is no need to beware of baby-cabs and wheelbarrows; but automobiles
are dangerous things. Several of my friends have been run over by
them."</p>

<p>"It can't be auto'biles," replied the girl, "for this is a new,
wild country, without even trolley-cars or tel'phones. The people
here haven't been discovered yet, I'm sure; that is, if there ARE
any people. So I don't b'lieve there CAN be any auto'biles,
Billina."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," admitted the yellow hen. "Where are you going
now?"</p>

<p>"Over to those trees, to see if I can find some fruit or nuts,"
answered Dorothy.</p>

<p>She tramped across the sand, skirting the foot of one of the
little rocky hills that stood near, and soon reached the edge of
the forest.</p>

<p>At first she was greatly disappointed, because the nearer trees
were all punita, or cotton-wood or eucalyptus, and bore no fruit or
nuts at all. But, bye and bye, when she was almost in despair, the
little girl came upon two trees that promised to furnish her with
plenty of food.</p>

<p>One was quite full of square paper boxes, which grew in clusters
on all the limbs, and upon the biggest and ripest boxes the word
"Lunch" could be read, in neat raised letters. This tree seemed to
bear all the year around, for there were lunch-box blossoms on some
of the branches, and on others tiny little lunch-boxes that were as
yet quite green, and evidently not fit to eat until they had grown
bigger.</p>

<p>The leaves of this tree were all paper napkins, and it presented
a very pleasing appearance to the hungry little girl.</p>

<p>But the tree next to the lunch-box tree was even more wonderful,
for it bore quantities of tin dinner-pails, which were so full and
heavy that the stout branches bent underneath their weight. Some
were small and dark-brown in color; those larger were of a dull tin
color; but the really ripe ones were pails of bright tin that shone
and glistened beautifully in the rays of sunshine that touched
them.</p>

<p>Dorothy was delighted, and even the yellow hen acknowledged that
she was surprised.</p>

<p>The little girl stood on tip-toe and picked one of the nicest
and biggest lunch-boxes, and then she sat down upon the ground and
eagerly opened it. Inside she found, nicely wrapped in white
papers, a ham sandwich, a piece of sponge-cake, a pickle, a slice
of new cheese and an apple. Each thing had a separate stem, and so
had to be picked off the side of the box; but Dorothy found them
all to be delicious, and she ate every bit of luncheon in the box
before she had finished.</p>

<p>"A lunch isn't zactly breakfast," she said to Billina, who sat
beside her curiously watching. "But when one is hungry one can eat
even supper in the morning, and not complain."</p>

<p>"I hope your lunch-box was perfectly ripe," observed the yellow
hen, in a anxious tone. "So much sickness is caused by eating green
things."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure it was ripe," declared Dorothy, "all, that is,
'cept the pickle, and a pickle just HAS to be green, Billina. But
everything tasted perfectly splendid, and I'd rather have it than a
church picnic. And now I think I'll pick a dinner-pail, to have
when I get hungry again, and then we'll start out and 'splore the
country, and see where we are."</p>

<p>"Haven't you any idea what country this is?" inquired
Billina.</p>

<p>"None at all. But listen: I'm quite sure it's a fairy country,
or such things as lunch-boxes and dinner-pails wouldn't be growing
upon trees. Besides, Billina, being a hen, you wouldn't be able to
talk in any civ'lized country, like Kansas, where no fairies live
at all."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we're in the Land of Oz," said the hen,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"No, that can't be," answered the little girl; "because I've
been to the Land of Oz, and it's all surrounded by a horrid desert
that no one can cross."</p>

<p>"Then how did you get away from there again?" asked Billina.</p>

<p>"I had a pair of silver shoes, that carried me through the air;
but I lost them," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed," remarked the yellow hen, in a tone of
unbelief.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," resumed the girl, "there is no seashore near the Land
of Oz, so this must surely be some other fairy country."</p>

<p>While she was speaking she selected a bright and pretty
dinner-pail that seemed to have a stout handle, and picked it from
its branch. Then, accompanied by the yellow hen, she walked out of
the shadow of the trees toward the seashore.</p>

<p>They were part way across the sands when Billina suddenly cried,
in a voice of terror:</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>Dorothy turned quickly around, and saw coming out of a path that
led from between the trees the most peculiar person her eyes had
ever beheld.</p>

<p>It had the form of a man, except that it walked, or rather
rolled, upon all fours, and its legs were the same length as its
arms, giving them the appearance of the four legs of a beast. Yet
it was no beast that Dorothy had discovered, for the person was
clothed most gorgeously in embroidered garments of many colors, and
wore a straw hat perched jauntily upon the side of its head. But it
differed from human beings in this respect, that instead of hands
and feet there grew at the end of its arms and legs round wheels,
and by means of these wheels it rolled very swiftly over the level
ground. Afterward Dorothy found that these odd wheels were of the
same hard substance that our finger-nails and toe-nails are
composed of, and she also learned that creatures of this strange
race were born in this queer fashion. But when our little girl
first caught sight of the first individual of a race that was
destined to cause her a lot of trouble, she had an idea that the
brilliantly-clothed personage was on roller-skates, which were
attached to his hands as well as to his feet.</p>

<p>"Run!" screamed the yellow hen, fluttering away in great fright.
"It's a Wheeler!"</p>

<p>"A Wheeler?" exclaimed Dorothy. "What can that be?"</p>

<p>"Don't you remember the warning in the sand: 'Beware the
Wheelers'? Run, I tell you&mdash;run!"</p>

<p>So Dorothy ran, and the Wheeler gave a sharp, wild cry and came
after her in full chase.</p>

<p>Looking over her shoulder as she ran, the girl now saw a great
procession of Wheelers emerging from the forest&mdash;dozens and
dozens of them&mdash;all clad in splendid, tight-fitting garments
and all rolling swiftly toward her and uttering their wild, strange
cries.</p>

<p>"They're sure to catch us!" panted the girl, who was still
carrying the heavy dinner-pail she had picked. "I can't run much
farther, Billina."</p>

<p>"Climb up this hill,&mdash;quick!" said the hen; and Dorothy
found she was very near to the heap of loose and jagged rocks they
had passed on their way to the forest. The yellow hen was even now
fluttering among the rocks, and Dorothy followed as best she could,
half climbing and half tumbling up the rough and rugged steep.</p>

<p>She was none too soon, for the foremost Wheeler reached the hill
a moment after her; but while the girl scrambled up the rocks the
creature stopped short with howls of rage and disappointment.</p>

<p>Dorothy now heard the yellow hen laughing, in her cackling,
henny way.</p>

<p>"Don't hurry, my dear," cried Billina. "They can't follow us
among these rocks, so we're safe enough now."</p>

<p>Dorothy stopped at once and sat down upon a broad boulder, for
she was all out of breath.</p>

<p>The rest of the Wheelers had now reached the foot of the hill,
but it was evident that their wheels would not roll upon the rough
and jagged rocks, and therefore they were helpless to follow
Dorothy and the hen to where they had taken refuge. But they
circled all around the little hill, so the child and Billina were
fast prisoners and could not come down without being captured.</p>

<p>Then the creatures shook their front wheels at Dorothy in a
threatening manner, and it seemed they were able to speak as well
as to make their dreadful outcries, for several of them
shouted:</p>

<p>"We'll get you in time, never fear! And when we do get you,
we'll tear you into little bits!"</p>

<p>"Why are you so cruel to me?" asked Dorothy. "I'm a stranger in
your country, and have done you no harm."</p>

<p>"No harm!" cried one who seemed to be their leader. "Did you not
pick our lunch-boxes and dinner-pails? Have you not a stolen
dinner-pail still in your hand?"</p>

<p>"I only picked one of each," she answered. "I was hungry, and I
didn't know the trees were yours."</p>

<p>"That is no excuse," retorted the leader, who was clothed in a
most gorgeous suit. "It is the law here that whoever picks a
dinner-pail without our permission must die immediately."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe him," said Billina. "I'm sure the trees do
not belong to these awful creatures. They are fit for any mischief,
and it's my opinion they would try to kill us just the same if you
hadn't picked a dinner-pail."</p>

<p>"I think so, too," agreed Dorothy. "But what shall we do
now?"</p>

<p>"Stay where we are," advised the yellow hen. "We are safe from
the Wheelers until we starve to death, anyhow; and before that time
comes a good many things can happen."</p>

<h2>4. Tiktok the Machine Man</h2>

<p>After an hour or so most of the band of Wheelers rolled back
into the forest, leaving only three of their number to guard the
hill. These curled themselves up like big dogs and pretended to go
to sleep on the sands; but neither Dorothy nor Billina were fooled
by this trick, so they remained in security among the rocks and
paid no attention to their cunning enemies.</p>

<p>Finally the hen, fluttering over the mound, exclaimed: "Why,
here's a path!"</p>

<p>So Dorothy at once clambered to where Billina sat, and there,
sure enough, was a smooth path cut between the rocks. It seemed to
wind around the mound from top to bottom, like a cork-screw,
twisting here and there between the rough boulders but always
remaining level and easy to walk upon.</p>

<p>Indeed, Dorothy wondered at first why the Wheelers did not roll
up this path; but when she followed it to the foot of the mound she
found that several big pieces of rock had been placed directly
across the end of the way, thus preventing any one outside from
seeing it and also preventing the Wheelers from using it to climb
up the mound.</p>

<p>Then Dorothy walked back up the path, and followed it until she
came to the very top of the hill, where a solitary round rock stood
that was bigger than any of the others surrounding it. The path
came to an end just beside this great rock, and for a moment it
puzzled the girl to know why the path had been made at all. But the
hen, who had been gravely following her around and was now perched
upon a point of rock behind Dorothy, suddenly remarked:</p>

<p>"It looks something like a door, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"What looks like a door?" enquired the child.</p>

<p>"Why, that crack in the rock, just facing you," replied Billina,
whose little round eyes were very sharp and seemed to see
everything. "It runs up one side and down the other, and across the
top and the bottom."</p>

<p>"What does?"</p>

<p>"Why, the crack. So I think it must be a door of rock, although
I do not see any hinges."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Dorothy, now observing for the first time the
crack in the rock. "And isn't this a key-hole, Billina?" pointing
to a round, deep hole at one side of the door.</p>

<p>"Of course. If we only had the key, now, we could unlock it and
see what is there," replied the yellow hen. "May be it's a treasure
chamber full of diamonds and rubies, or heaps of shining gold,
or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That reminds me," said Dorothy, "of the golden key I picked up
on the shore. Do you think that it would fit this key-hole,
Billina?"</p>

<p>"Try it and see," suggested the hen.</p>

<p>So Dorothy searched in the pocket of her dress and found the
golden key. And when she had put it into the hole of the rock, and
turned it, a sudden sharp snap was heard; then, with a solemn creak
that made the shivers run down the child's back, the face of the
rock fell outward, like a door on hinges, and revealed a small dark
chamber just inside.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" cried Dorothy, shrinking back as far as the
narrow path would let her.</p>

<p>For, standing within the narrow chamber of rock, was the form of
a man&mdash;or, at least, it seemed like a man, in the dim light.
He was only about as tall as Dorothy herself, and his body was
round as a ball and made out of burnished copper. Also his head and
limbs were copper, and these were jointed or hinged to his body in
a peculiar way, with metal caps over the joints, like the armor
worn by knights in days of old. He stood perfectly still, and where
the light struck upon his form it glittered as if made of pure
gold.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened," called Billina, from her perch. "It isn't
alive."</p>

<p>"I see it isn't," replied the girl, drawing a long breath.</p>

<p>"It is only made out of copper, like the old kettle in the
barn-yard at home," continued the hen, turning her head first to
one side and then to the other, so that both her little round eyes
could examine the object.</p>

<p>"Once," said Dorothy, "I knew a man made out of tin, who was a
woodman named Nick Chopper. But he was as alive as we are, 'cause
he was born a real man, and got his tin body a little at a
time&mdash;first a leg and then a finger and then an ear&mdash;for
the reason that he had so many accidents with his axe, and cut
himself up in a very careless manner."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the hen, with a sniff, as if she did not believe the
story.</p>

<p>"But this copper man," continued Dorothy, looking at it with big
eyes, "is not alive at all, and I wonder what it was made for, and
why it was locked up in this queer place."</p>

<p>"That is a mystery," remarked the hen, twisting her head to
arrange her wing-feathers with her bill.</p>

<p>Dorothy stepped inside the little room to get a back view of the
copper man, and in this way discovered a printed card that hung
between his shoulders, it being suspended from a small copper peg
at the back of his neck. She unfastened this card and returned to
the path, where the light was better, and sat herself down upon a
slab of rock to read the printing.</p>

<p>"What does it say?" asked the hen, curiously.</p>

<p>Dorothy read the card aloud, spelling out the big words with
some difficulty; and this is what she read:</p>

<blockquote>SMITH &amp; TINKER'S<br>
Patent Double-Action, Extra-Responsive,<br>
Thought-Creating, Perfect-Talking<br>
MECHANICAL MAN<br>
Fitted with our Special Clock-Work Attachment.<br>
Thinks, Speaks, Acts, and Does Everything but Live.<br>
Manufactured only at our Works at Evna, Land of Ev.<br>
All infringements will be promptly Prosecuted according to
Law.</blockquote>

<p>"How queer!" said the yellow hen. "Do you think that is all
true, my dear?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Dorothy, who had more to read. "Listen
to this, Billina:"</p>

<blockquote>DIRECTIONS FOR USING:<br>
For THINKING:&mdash;Wind the Clock-work Man under his<br>
left arm, (marked No. 1.)<br>

For WALKING and ACTION:&mdash;Wind Clock-work in the<br>
middle of his back, (marked No. 3.)<br>
N. B.&mdash;This Mechanism is guaranteed to work<br>
perfectly for a thousand years.</blockquote>

<p>"Well, I declare!" gasped the yellow hen, in amazement; "if the
copper man can do half of these things he is a very wonderful
machine. But I suppose it is all humbug, like so many other
patented articles."</p>

<p>"We might wind him up," suggested Dorothy, "and see what he'll
do."</p>

<p>"Where is the key to the clock-work?" asked Billina.</p>

<p>"Hanging on the peg where I found the card."</p>

<p>"Then," said the hen, "let us try him, and find out if he will
go. He is warranted for a thousand years, it seems; but we do not
know how long he has been standing inside this rock."</p>

<p>Dorothy had already taken the clock key from the peg.</p>

<p>"Which shall I wind up first?" she asked, looking again at the
directions on the card.</p>

<p>"Number One, I should think," returned Billina. "That makes him
think, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dorothy, and wound up Number One, under the left
arm.</p>

<p>"He doesn't seem any different," remarked the hen,
critically.</p>

<p>"Why, of course not; he is only thinking, now," said
Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he is thinking about."</p>

<p>"I'll wind up his talk, and then perhaps he can tell us," said
the girl.</p>

<p>So she wound up Number Two, and immediately the clock-work man
said, without moving any part of his body except his lips:</p>

<p>"Good morn-ing, lit-tle girl. Good morn-ing, Mrs. Hen."</p>

<p>The words sounded a little hoarse and creaky, and they were
uttered all in the same tone, without any change of expression
whatever; but both Dorothy and Billina understood them
perfectly.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," they answered, politely.</p>

<p>"Thank you for res-cu-ing me," continued the machine, in the
same monotonous voice, which seemed to be worked by a bellows
inside of him, like the little toy lambs and cats the children
squeeze so that they will make a noise.</p>

<p>"Don't mention it," answered Dorothy. And then, being very
curious, she asked: "How did you come to be locked up in this
place?"</p>

<p>"It is a long sto-ry," replied the copper man; "but I will tell
it to you brief-ly. I was pur-chased from Smith &amp; Tin-ker, my
man-u-fac-tur-ers, by a cru-el King of Ev, named Ev-ol-do, who used
to beat all his serv-ants un-til they died. How-ev-er, he was not
a-ble to kill me, be-cause I was not a-live, and one must first
live in or-der to die. So that all his beat-ing did me no harm, and
mere-ly kept my cop-per bod-y well pol-ished.</p>

<p>"This cru-el king had a love-ly wife and ten beau-ti-ful
chil-dren&mdash;five boys and five girls&mdash;but in a fit of
an-ger he sold them all to the Nome King, who by means of his
mag-ic arts changed them all in-to oth-er forms and put them in his
un-der-ground pal-ace to or-na-ment the rooms.</p>

<p>"Af-ter-ward the King of Ev re-gret-ted his wick-ed ac-tion, and
tried to get his wife and chil-dren a-way from the Nome King, but
with-out a-vail. So, in de-spair, he locked me up in this rock,
threw the key in-to the o-cean, and then jumped in af-ter it and
was drowned."</p>

<p>"How very dreadful!" exclaimed Dorothy.</p>

<p>"It is, in-deed," said the machine. "When I found my-self
im-pris-oned I shout-ed for help un-til my voice ran down; and then
I walked back and forth in this lit-tle room un-til my ac-tion ran
down; and then I stood still and thought un-til my thoughts ran
down. Af-ter that I re-mem-ber noth-ing un-til you wound me up
a-gain."</p>

<p>"It's a very wonderful story," said Dorothy, "and proves that
the Land of Ev is really a fairy land, as I thought it was."</p>

<p>"Of course it is," answered the copper man. "I do not sup-pose
such a per-fect ma-chine as I am could be made in an-y place but a
fair-y land."</p>

<p>"I've never seen one in Kansas," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"But where did you get the key to un-lock this door?" asked the
clock-work voice.</p>

<p>"I found it on the shore, where it was prob'ly washed up by the
waves," she answered. "And now, sir, if you don't mind, I'll wind
up your action."</p>

<p>"That will please me ve-ry much," said the machine.</p>

<p>So she wound up Number Three, and at once the copper man in a
somewhat stiff and jerky fashion walked out of the rocky cavern,
took off his copper hat and bowed politely, and then kneeled before
Dorothy. Said he:</p>

<p>"From this time forth I am your o-be-di-ent ser-vant. What-ev-er
you com-mand, that I will do will-ing-ly&mdash;if you keep me wound
up."</p>

<p>"What is your name?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Tik-tok," he replied. "My for-mer mas-ter gave me that name
be-cause my clock-work al-ways ticks when it is wound up."</p>

<p>"I can hear it now," said the yellow hen.</p>

<p>"So can I," said Dorothy. And then she added, with some anxiety:
"You don't strike, do you?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Tiktok; "and there is no a-larm con-nec-ted with
my ma-chin-er-y. I can tell the time, though, by speak-ing, and as
I nev-er sleep I can wak-en you at an-y hour you wish to get up in
the morn-ing."</p>

<p>"That's nice," said the little girl; "only I never wish to get
up in the morning."</p>

<p>"You can sleep until I lay my egg," said the yellow hen. "Then,
when I cackle, Tiktok will know it is time to waken you."</p>

<p>"Do you lay your egg very early?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"About eight o'clock," said Billina. "And everybody ought to be
up by that time, I'm sure."</p>

<h2>5. Dorothy Opens the Dinner Pail</h2>

<p>"Now Tiktok," said Dorothy, "the first thing to be done is to
find a way for us to escape from these rocks. The Wheelers are down
below, you know, and threaten to kill us."</p>

<p>"There is no rea-son to be a-fraid of the Wheel-ers," said
Tiktok, the words coming more slowly than before.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Be-cause they are ag-g-g&mdash;gr-gr-r-r-"</p>

<p>He gave a sort of gurgle and stopped short, waving his hands
frantically until suddenly he became motionless, with one arm in
the air and the other held stiffly before him with all the copper
fingers of the hand spread out like a fan.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Dorothy, in a frightened tone. "What can the
matter be?"</p>

<p>"He's run down, I suppose," said the hen, calmly. "You couldn't
have wound him up very tight."</p>

<p>"I didn't know how much to wind him," replied the girl; "but
I'll try to do better next time."</p>

<p>She ran around the copper man to take the key from the peg at
the back of his neck, but it was not there.</p>

<p>"It's gone!" cried Dorothy, in dismay.</p>

<p>"What's gone?" asked Billina.</p>

<p>"The key."</p>

<p>"It probably fell off when he made that low bow to you,"
returned the hen. "Look around, and see if you cannot find it
again."</p>

<p>Dorothy looked, and the hen helped her, and by and by the girl
discovered the clock-key, which had fallen into a crack of the
rock.</p>

<p>At once she wound up Tiktok's voice, taking care to give the key
as many turns as it would go around. She found this quite a task,
as you may imagine if you have ever tried to wind a clock, but the
machine man's first words were to assure Dorothy that he would now
run for at least twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>"You did not wind me much, at first," he calmly said, "and I
told you that long sto-ry a-bout King Ev-ol-do; so it is no won-der
that I ran down."</p>

<p>She next rewound the action clock-work, and then Billina advised
her to carry the key to Tiktok in her pocket, so it would not get
lost again.</p>

<p>"And now," said Dorothy, when all this was accomplished, "tell
me what you were going to say about the Wheelers."</p>

<p>"Why, they are noth-ing to be fright-en'd at," said the machine.
"They try to make folks be-lieve that they are ver-y ter-ri-ble,
but as a mat-ter of fact the Wheel-ers are harm-less e-nough to
an-y one that dares to fight them. They might try to hurt a lit-tle
girl like you, per-haps, be-cause they are ver-y mis-chiev-ous. But
if I had a club they would run a-way as soon as they saw me."</p>

<p>"Haven't you a club?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"No," said Tiktok.</p>

<p>"And you won't find such a thing among these rocks, either,"
declared the yellow hen.</p>

<p>"Then what shall we do?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Wind up my think-works tight-ly, and I will try to think of
some oth-er plan," said Tiktok.</p>

<p>So Dorothy rewound his thought machinery, and while he was
thinking she decided to eat her dinner. Billina was already pecking
away at the cracks in the rocks, to find something to eat, so
Dorothy sat down and opened her tin dinner-pail.</p>

<p>In the cover she found a small tank that was full of very nice
lemonade. It was covered by a cup, which might also, when removed,
be used to drink the lemonade from. Within the pail were three
slices of turkey, two slices of cold tongue, some lobster salad,
four slices of bread and butter, a small custard pie, an orange and
nine large strawberries, and some nuts and raisins. Singularly
enough, the nuts in this dinner-pail grew already cracked, so that
Dorothy had no trouble in picking out their meats to eat.</p>

<p>She spread the feast upon the rock beside her and began her
dinner, first offering some of it to Tiktok, who declined because,
as he said, he was merely a machine. Afterward she offered to share
with Billina, but the hen murmured something about "dead things"
and said she preferred her bugs and ants.</p>

<p>"Do the lunch-box trees and the dinner-pail trees belong to the
Wheelers?" the child asked Tiktok, while engaged in eating her
meal.</p>

<p>"Of course not," he answered. "They be-long to the roy-al
fam-il-y of Ev, on-ly of course there is no roy-al fam-il-y just
now be-cause King Ev-ol-do jumped in-to the sea and his wife and
ten chil-dren have been trans-formed by the Nome King. So there is
no one to rule the Land of Ev, that I can think of. Per-haps it is
for this rea-son that the Wheel-ers claim the trees for their own,
and pick the lunch-eons and din-ners to eat them-selves. But they
be-long to the King, and you will find the roy-al 'E' stamped up-on
the bot-tom of ev-er-y din-ner pail."</p>

<p>Dorothy turned the pail over, and at once discovered the royal
mark upon it, as Tiktok had said.</p>

<p>"Are the Wheelers the only folks living in the Land of Ev?"
enquired the girl.</p>

<p>"No; they on-ly in-hab-it a small por-tion of it just back of
the woods," replied the machine. "But they have al-ways been
mis-chiev-ous and im-per-ti-nent, and my old mas-ter, King
Ev-ol-do, used to car-ry a whip with him, when he walked out, to
keep the crea-tures in or-der. When I was first made the Wheel-ers
tried to run o-ver me, and butt me with their heads; but they soon
found I was built of too sol-id a ma-ter-i-al for them to
in-jure."</p>

<p>"You seem very durable," said Dorothy. "Who made you?"</p>

<p>"The firm of Smith &amp; Tin-ker, in the town of Evna, where the
roy-al pal-ace stands," answered Tiktok.</p>

<p>"Did they make many of you?" asked the child.</p>

<p>"No; I am the on-ly au-to-mat-ic me-chan-i-cal man they ev-er
com-plet-ed," he replied. "They were ver-y won-der-ful in-ven-tors,
were my mak-ers, and quite ar-tis-tic in all they did."</p>

<p>"I am sure of that," said Dorothy. "Do they live in the town of
Evna now?"</p>

<p>"They are both gone," replied the machine. "Mr. Smith was an
art-ist, as well as an in-vent-or, and he paint-ed a pic-ture of a
riv-er which was so nat-ur-al that, as he was reach-ing a-cross it
to paint some flow-ers on the op-po-site bank, he fell in-to the
wa-ter and was drowned."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry for that!" exclaimed the little girl.</p>

<p>"Mis-ter Tin-ker," continued Tiktok, "made a lad-der so tall
that he could rest the end of it a-gainst the moon, while he stood
on the high-est rung and picked the lit-tle stars to set in the
points of the king's crown. But when he got to the moon Mis-ter
Tin-ker found it such a love-ly place that he de-cid-ed to live
there, so he pulled up the lad-der af-ter him and we have nev-er
seen him since."</p>

<p>"He must have been a great loss to this country," said Dorothy,
who was by this time eating her custard pie.</p>

<p>"He was," acknowledged Tiktok. "Also he is a great loss to me.
For if I should get out of or-der I do not know of an-y one a-ble
to re-pair me, be-cause I am so com-pli-cat-ed. You have no i-de-a
how full of ma-chin-er-y I am."</p>

<p>"I can imagine it," said Dorothy, readily.</p>

<p>"And now," continued the machine, "I must stop talk-ing and
be-gin think-ing a-gain of a way to es-cape from this rock." So he
turned half way around, in order to think without being
disturbed.</p>

<p>"The best thinker I ever knew," said Dorothy to the yellow hen,
"was a scarecrow."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" snapped Billina.</p>

<p>"It is true," declared Dorothy. "I met him in the Land of Oz,
and he traveled with me to the city of the great Wizard of Oz, so
as to get some brains, for his head was only stuffed with straw.
But it seemed to me that he thought just as well before he got his
brains as he did afterward."</p>

<p>"Do you expect me to believe all that rubbish about the Land of
Oz?" enquired Billina, who seemed a little cross&mdash;perhaps
because bugs were scarce.</p>

<p>"What rubbish?" asked the child, who was now finishing her nuts
and raisins.</p>

<p>"Why, your impossible stories about animals that can talk, and a
tin woodman who is alive, and a scarecrow who can think."</p>

<p>"They are all there," said Dorothy, "for I have seen them."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!" cried the hen, with a toss of her
head.</p>

<p>"That's 'cause you're so ign'rant," replied the girl, who was a
little offended at her friend Billina's speech.</p>

<p>"In the Land of Oz," remarked Tiktok, turning toward them,
"an-y-thing is pos-si-ble. For it is a won-der-ful fair-y
coun-try."</p>

<p>"There, Billina! what did I say?" cried Dorothy. And then she
turned to the machine and asked in an eager tone: "Do you know the
Land of Oz, Tiktok?"</p>

<p>"No; but I have heard a-bout it," said the copper man. "For it
is on-ly sep-a-ra-ted from this Land of Ev by a broad des-ert."</p>

<p>Dorothy clapped her hands together delightedly.</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that!" she exclaimed. "It makes me quite happy to
be so near my old friends. The scarecrow I told you of, Billina, is
the King of the Land of Oz."</p>

<p>"Par-don me. He is not the king now," said Tiktok.</p>

<p>"He was when I left there," declared Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I know," said Tiktok, "but there was a rev-o-lu-tion in the
Land of Oz, and the Scare-crow was de-posed by a sol-dier wo-man
named Gen-er-al Jin-jur. And then Jin-jur was de-posed by a lit-tle
girl named Oz-ma, who was the right-ful heir to the throne and now
rules the land un-der the ti-tle of Oz-ma of Oz."</p>

<p>"That is news to me," said Dorothy, thoughtfully. "But I s'pose
lots of things have happened since I left the Land of Oz. I wonder
what has become of the Scarecrow, and of the Tin Woodman, and the
Cowardly Lion. And I wonder who this girl Ozma is, for I never
heard of her before."</p>

<p>But Tiktok did not reply to this. He had turned around again to
resume his thinking.</p>

<p>Dorothy packed the rest of the food back into the pail, so as
not to be wasteful of good things, and the yellow hen forgot her
dignity far enough to pick up all of the scattered crumbs, which
she ate rather greedily, although she had so lately pretended to
despise the things that Dorothy preferred as food.</p>

<p>By this time Tiktok approached them with his stiff bow.</p>

<p>"Be kind e-nough to fol-low me," he said, "and I will lead you
a-way from here to the town of Ev-na, where you will be more
com-for-ta-ble, and al-so I will pro-tect you from the
Wheel-ers."</p>

<p>"All right," answered Dorothy, promptly. "I'm ready!"</p>

<h2>6. The Heads of Langwidere</h2>

<p>They walked slowly down the path between the rocks, Tiktok going
first, Dorothy following him, and the yellow hen trotting along
last of all.</p>

<p>At the foot of the path the copper man leaned down and tossed
aside with ease the rocks that encumbered the way. Then he turned
to Dorothy and said:</p>

<p>"Let me car-ry your din-ner-pail."</p>

<p>She placed it in his right hand at once, and the copper fingers
closed firmly over the stout handle.</p>

<p>Then the little procession marched out upon the level sands.</p>

<p>As soon as the three Wheelers who were guarding the mound saw
them, they began to shout their wild cries and rolled swiftly
toward the little group, as if to capture them or bar their way.
But when the foremost had approached near enough, Tiktok swung the
tin dinner-pail and struck the Wheeler a sharp blow over its head
with the queer weapon. Perhaps it did not hurt very much, but it
made a great noise, and the Wheeler uttered a howl and tumbled over
upon its side. The next minute it scrambled to its wheels and
rolled away as fast as it could go, screeching with fear at the
same time.</p>

<p>"I told you they were harm-less," began Tiktok; but before he
could say more another Wheeler was upon them. Crack! went the
dinner-pail against its head, knocking its straw hat a dozen feet
away; and that was enough for this Wheeler, also. It rolled away
after the first one, and the third did not wait to be pounded with
the pail, but joined its fellows as quickly as its wheels would
whirl.</p>

<p>The yellow hen gave a cackle of delight, and flying to a perch
upon Tiktok's shoulder, she said:</p>

<p>"Bravely done, my copper friend! and wisely thought of, too. Now
we are free from those ugly creatures."</p>

<p>But just then a large band of Wheelers rolled from the forest,
and relying upon their numbers to conquer, they advanced fiercely
upon Tiktok. Dorothy grabbed Billina in her arms and held her
tight, and the machine embraced the form of the little girl with
his left arm, the better to protect her. Then the Wheelers were
upon them.</p>

<p>Rattlety, bang! bang! went the dinner-pail in every direction,
and it made so much clatter bumping against the heads of the
Wheelers that they were much more frightened than hurt and fled in
a great panic. All, that is, except their leader. This Wheeler had
stumbled against another and fallen flat upon his back, and before
he could get his wheels under him to rise again, Tiktok had
fastened his copper fingers into the neck of the gorgeous jacket of
his foe and held him fast.</p>

<p>"Tell your peo-ple to go a-way," commanded the machine.</p>

<p>The leader of the Wheelers hesitated to give this order, so
Tiktok shook him as a terrier dog does a rat, until the Wheeler's
teeth rattled together with a noise like hailstones on a window
pane. Then, as soon as the creature could get its breath, it
shouted to the others to roll away, which they immediately did.</p>

<p>"Now," said Tiktok, "you shall come with us and tell me what I
want to know."</p>

<p>"You'll be sorry for treating me in this way," whined the
Wheeler. "I'm a terribly fierce person."</p>

<p>"As for that," answered Tiktok, "I am only a ma-chine, and
can-not feel sor-row or joy, no mat-ter what hap-pens. But you are
wrong to think your-self ter-ri-ble or fierce."</p>

<p>"Why so?" asked the Wheeler.</p>

<p>"Be-cause no one else thinks as you do. Your wheels make you
help-less to in-jure an-y one. For you have no fists and can not
scratch or e-ven pull hair. Nor have you an-y feet to kick with.
All you can do is to yell and shout, and that does not hurt an-y
one at all."</p>

<p>The Wheeler burst into a flood of tears, to Dorothy's great
surprise.</p>

<p>"Now I and my people are ruined forever!" he sobbed; "for you
have discovered our secret. Being so helpless, our only hope is to
make people afraid of us, by pretending we are very fierce and
terrible, and writing in the sand warnings to Beware the Wheelers.
Until now we have frightened everyone, but since you have
discovered our weakness our enemies will fall upon us and make us
very miserable and unhappy."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," exclaimed Dorothy, who was sorry to see this
beautifully dressed Wheeler so miserable; "Tiktok will keep your
secret, and so will Billina and I. Only, you must promise not to
try to frighten children any more, if they come near to you."</p>

<p>"I won't&mdash;indeed I won't!" promised the Wheeler, ceasing to
cry and becoming more cheerful. "I'm not really bad, you know; but
we have to pretend to be terrible in order to prevent others from
attacking us."</p>

<p>"That is not ex-act-ly true," said Tiktok, starting to walk
toward the path through the forest, and still holding fast to his
prisoner, who rolled slowly along beside him. "You and your peo-ple
are full of mis-chief, and like to both-er those who fear you. And
you are of-ten im-pu-dent and dis-a-gree-a-ble, too. But if you
will try to cure those faults I will not tell any-one how help-less
you are."</p>

<p>"I'll try, of course," replied the Wheeler, eagerly. "And thank
you, Mr. Tiktok, for your kindness."</p>

<p>"I am on-ly a ma-chine," said Tiktok. "I can not be kind an-y
more than I can be sor-ry or glad. I can on-ly do what I am wound
up to do."</p>

<p>"Are you wound up to keep my secret?" asked the Wheeler,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes; if you be-have your-self. But tell me: who rules the Land
of Ev now?" asked the machine.</p>

<p>"There is no ruler," was the answer, "because every member of
the royal family is imprisoned by the Nome King. But the Princess
Langwidere, who is a niece of our late King Evoldo, lives in a part
of the royal palace and takes as much money out of the royal
treasury as she can spend. The Princess Langwidere is not exactly a
ruler, you see, because she doesn't rule; but she is the nearest
approach to a ruler we have at present."</p>

<p>"I do not re-mem-ber her," said Tiktok. "What does she look
like?"</p>

<p>"That I cannot say," replied the Wheeler, "although I have seen
her twenty times. For the Princess Langwidere is a different person
every time I see her, and the only way her subjects can recognize
her at all is by means of a beautiful ruby key which she always
wears on a chain attached to her left wrist. When we see the key we
know we are beholding the Princess."</p>

<p>"That is strange," said Dorothy, in astonishment. "Do you mean
to say that so many different princesses are one and the same
person?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," answered the Wheeler. "There is, of course, but
one princess; but she appears to us in many forms, which are all
more or less beautiful."</p>

<p>"She must be a witch," exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>"I do not think so," declared the Wheeler. "But there is some
mystery connected with her, nevertheless. She is a very vain
creature, and lives mostly in a room surrounded by mirrors, so that
she can admire herself whichever way she looks."</p>

<p>No one answered this speech, because they had just passed out of
the forest and their attention was fixed upon the scene before
them&mdash;a beautiful vale in which were many fruit trees and
green fields, with pretty farm-houses scattered here and there and
broad, smooth roads that led in every direction.</p>

<p>In the center of this lovely vale, about a mile from where our
friends were standing, rose the tall spires of the royal palace,
which glittered brightly against their background of blue sky. The
palace was surrounded by charming grounds, full of flowers and
shrubbery. Several tinkling fountains could be seen, and there were
pleasant walks bordered by rows of white marble statuary.</p>

<p>All these details Dorothy was, of course, unable to notice or
admire until they had advanced along the road to a position quite
near to the palace, and she was still looking at the pretty sights
when her little party entered the grounds and approached the big
front door of the king's own apartments. To their disappointment
they found the door tightly closed. A sign was tacked to the panel
which read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>OWNER ABSENT.<br>
Please Knock at the Third<br>
Door in the Left Wing.</blockquote>

<p>"Now," said Tiktok to the captive Wheeler, "you must show us the
way to the Left Wing."</p>

<p>"Very well," agreed the prisoner, "it is around here at the
right."</p>

<p>"How can the left wing be at the right?" demanded Dorothy, who
feared the Wheeler was fooling them.</p>

<p>"Because there used to be three wings, and two were torn down,
so the one on the right is the only one left. It is a trick of the
Princess Langwidere to prevent visitors from annoying her."</p>

<p>Then the captive led them around to the wing, after which the
machine man, having no further use for the Wheeler, permitted him
to depart and rejoin his fellows. He immediately rolled away at a
great pace and was soon lost to sight.</p>

<p>Tiktok now counted the doors in the wing and knocked loudly upon
the third one.</p>

<p>It was opened by a little maid in a cap trimmed with gay
ribbons, who bowed respectfully and asked:</p>

<p>"What do you wish, good people?"</p>

<p>"Are you the Princess Langwidere?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"No, miss; I am her servant," replied the maid.</p>

<p>"May I see the Princess, please?"</p>

<p>"I will tell her you are here, miss, and ask her to grant you an
audience," said the maid. "Step in, please, and take a seat in the
drawing-room."</p>

<p>So Dorothy walked in, followed closely by the machine. But as
the yellow hen tried to enter after them, the little maid cried
"Shoo!" and flapped her apron in Billina's face.</p>

<p>"Shoo, yourself!" retorted the hen, drawing back in anger and
ruffling up her feathers. "Haven't you any better manners than
that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, do you talk?" enquired the maid, evidently surprised.</p>

<p>"Can't you hear me?" snapped Billina. "Drop that apron, and get
out of the doorway, so that I may enter with my friends!"</p>

<p>"The Princess won't like it," said the maid, hesitating.</p>

<p>"I don't care whether she likes it or not," replied Billina, and
fluttering her wings with a loud noise she flew straight at the
maid's face. The little servant at once ducked her head, and the
hen reached Dorothy's side in safety.</p>

<p>"Very well," sighed the maid; "if you are all ruined because of
this obstinate hen, don't blame me for it. It isn't safe to annoy
the Princess Langwidere."</p>

<p>"Tell her we are waiting, if you please," Dorothy requested,
with dignity. "Billina is my friend, and must go wherever I
go."</p>

<p>Without more words the maid led them to a richly furnished
drawing-room, lighted with subdued rainbow tints that came in
through beautiful stained-glass windows.</p>

<p>"Remain here," she said. "What names shall I give the
Princess?"</p>

<p>"I am Dorothy Gale, of Kansas," replied the child; "and this
gentleman is a machine named Tiktok, and the yellow hen is my
friend Billina."</p>

<p>The little servant bowed and withdrew, going through several
passages and mounting two marble stairways before she came to the
apartments occupied by her mistress.</p>

<p>Princess Langwidere's sitting-room was paneled with great
mirrors, which reached from the ceiling to the floor; also the
ceiling was composed of mirrors, and the floor was of polished
silver that reflected every object upon it. So when Langwidere sat
in her easy chair and played soft melodies upon her mandolin, her
form was mirrored hundreds of times, in walls and ceiling and
floor, and whichever way the lady turned her head she could see and
admire her own features. This she loved to do, and just as the maid
entered she was saying to herself:</p>

<p>"This head with the auburn hair and hazel eyes is quite
attractive. I must wear it more often than I have done of late,
although it may not be the best of my collection."</p>

<p>"You have company, Your Highness," announced the maid, bowing
low.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked Langwidere, yawning.</p>

<p>"Dorothy Gale of Kansas, Mr. Tiktok and Billina," answered the
maid.</p>

<p>"What a queer lot of names!" murmured the Princess, beginning to
be a little interested. "What are they like? Is Dorothy Gale of
Kansas pretty?"</p>

<p>"She might be called so," the maid replied.</p>

<p>"And is Mr. Tiktok attractive?" continued the Princess.</p>

<p>"That I cannot say, Your Highness. But he seems very bright.
Will Your Gracious Highness see them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I may as well, Nanda. But I am tired admiring this head,
and if my visitor has any claim to beauty I must take care that she
does not surpass me. So I will go to my cabinet and change to No.
17, which I think is my best appearance. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Your No. 17 is exceedingly beautiful," answered Nanda, with
another bow.</p>

<p>Again the Princess yawned. Then she said:</p>

<p>"Help me to rise."</p>

<p>So the maid assisted her to gain her feet, although Langwidere
was the stronger of the two; and then the Princess slowly walked
across the silver floor to her cabinet, leaning heavily at every
step upon Nanda's arm.</p>

<p>Now I must explain to you that the Princess Langwidere had
thirty heads&mdash;as many as there are days in the month. But of
course she could only wear one of them at a time, because she had
but one neck. These heads were kept in what she called her
"cabinet," which was a beautiful dressing-room that lay just
between Langwidere's sleeping-chamber and the mirrored
sitting-room. Each head was in a separate cupboard lined with
velvet. The cupboards ran all around the sides of the
dressing-room, and had elaborately carved doors with gold numbers
on the outside and jeweled-framed mirrors on the inside of
them.</p>

<p>When the Princess got out of her crystal bed in the morning she
went to her cabinet, opened one of the velvet-lined cupboards, and
took the head it contained from its golden shelf. Then, by the aid
of the mirror inside the open door, she put on the head&mdash;as
neat and straight as could be&mdash;and afterward called her maids
to robe her for the day. She always wore a simple white costume,
that suited all the heads. For, being able to change her face
whenever she liked, the Princess had no interest in wearing a
variety of gowns, as have other ladies who are compelled to wear
the same face constantly.</p>

<p>Of course the thirty heads were in great variety, no two formed
alike but all being of exceeding loveliness. There were heads with
golden hair, brown hair, rich auburn hair and black hair; but none
with gray hair. The heads had eyes of blue, of gray, of hazel, of
brown and of black; but there were no red eyes among them, and all
were bright and handsome. The noses were Grecian, Roman, retrousse
and Oriental, representing all types of beauty; and the mouths were
of assorted sizes and shapes, displaying pearly teeth when the
heads smiled. As for dimples, they appeared in cheeks and chins,
wherever they might be most charming, and one or two heads had
freckles upon the faces to contrast the better with the brilliancy
of their complexions.</p>

<p>One key unlocked all the velvet cupboards containing these
treasures&mdash;a curious key carved from a single blood-red
ruby&mdash;and this was fastened to a strong but slender chain
which the Princess wore around her left wrist.</p>

<p>When Nanda had supported Langwidere to a position in front of
cupboard No. 17, the Princess unlocked the door with her ruby key
and after handing head No. 9, which she had been wearing, to the
maid, she took No. 17 from its shelf and fitted it to her neck. It
had black hair and dark eyes and a lovely pearl-and-white
complexion, and when Langwidere wore it she knew she was remarkably
beautiful in appearance.</p>

<p>There was only one trouble with No. 17; the temper that went
with it (and which was hidden somewhere under the glossy black
hair) was fiery, harsh and haughty in the extreme, and it often led
the Princess to do unpleasant things which she regretted when she
came to wear her other heads.</p>

<p>But she did not remember this today, and went to meet her guests
in the drawing-room with a feeling of certainty that she would
surprise them with her beauty.</p>

<p>However, she was greatly disappointed to find that her visitors
were merely a small girl in a gingham dress, a copper man that
would only go when wound up, and a yellow hen that was sitting
contentedly in Langwidere's best work-basket, where there was a
china egg used for darning stockings. (It may surprise you to learn
that a princess ever does such a common thing as darn stockings.
But, if you will stop to think, you will realize that a princess is
sure to wear holes in her stockings, the same as other people; only
it isn't considered quite polite to mention the matter.)</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Langwidere, slightly lifting the nose of No. 17. "I
thought some one of importance had called."</p>

<p>"Then you were right," declared Dorothy. "I'm a good deal of
'portance myself, and when Billina lays an egg she has the proudest
cackle you ever heard. As for Tiktok, he's the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop&mdash;Stop!" commanded the Princess, with an angry flash
of her splendid eyes. "How dare you annoy me with your senseless
chatter?"</p>

<p>"Why, you horrid thing!" said Dorothy, who was not accustomed to
being treated so rudely.</p>

<p>The Princess looked at her more closely.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she resumed, "are you of royal blood?"</p>

<p>"Better than that, ma'am," said Dorothy. "I came from
Kansas."</p>

<p>"Huh!" cried the Princess, scornfully. "You are a foolish child,
and I cannot allow you to annoy me. Run away, you little goose, and
bother some one else."</p>

<p>Dorothy was so indignant that for a moment she could find no
words to reply. But she rose from her chair, and was about to leave
the room when the Princess, who had been scanning the girl's face,
stopped her by saying, more gently:</p>

<p>"Come nearer to me."</p>

<p>Dorothy obeyed, without a thought of fear, and stood before the
Princess while Langwidere examined her face with careful
attention.</p>

<p>"You are rather attractive," said the lady, presently. "Not at
all beautiful, you understand, but you have a certain style of
prettiness that is different from that of any of my thirty heads.
So I believe I'll take your head and give you No. 26 for it."</p>

<p>"Well, I b'lieve you won't!" exclaimed Dorothy.</p>

<p>"It will do you no good to refuse," continued the Princess; "for
I need your head for my collection, and in the Land of Ev my will
is law. I never have cared much for No. 26, and you will find that
it is very little worn. Besides, it will do you just as well as the
one you're wearing, for all practical purposes."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about your No. 26, and I don't want to,"
said Dorothy, firmly. "I'm not used to taking cast-off things, so
I'll just keep my own head."</p>

<p>"You refuse?" cried the Princess, with a frown.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Then," said Langwidere, "I shall lock you up in a tower until
you decide to obey me. Nanda," turning to her maid, "call my
army."</p>

<p>Nanda rang a silver bell, and at once a big fat colonel in a
bright red uniform entered the room, followed by ten lean soldiers,
who all looked sad and discouraged and saluted the princess in a
very melancholy fashion.</p>

<p>"Carry that girl to the North Tower and lock her up!" cried the
Princess, pointing to Dorothy.</p>

<p>"To hear is to obey," answered the big red colonel, and caught
the child by her arm. But at that moment Tiktok raised his
dinner-pail and pounded it so forcibly against the colonel's head
that the big officer sat down upon the floor with a sudden bump,
looking both dazed and very much astonished.</p>

<p>"Help!" he shouted, and the ten lean soldiers sprang to assist
their leader.</p>

<p>There was great excitement for the next few moments, and Tiktok
had knocked down seven of the army, who were sprawling in every
direction upon the carpet, when suddenly the machine paused, with
the dinner-pail raised for another blow, and remained perfectly
motionless.</p>

<p>"My ac-tion has run down," he called to Dorothy. "Wind me up,
quick."</p>

<p>She tried to obey, but the big colonel had by this time managed
to get upon his feet again, so he grabbed fast hold of the girl and
she was helpless to escape.</p>

<p>"This is too bad," said the machine. "I ought to have run six
hours lon-ger, at least, but I sup-pose my long walk and my fight
with the Wheel-ers made me run down fast-er than us-u-al."</p>

<p>"Well, it can't be helped," said Dorothy, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Will you exchange heads with me?" demanded the Princess.</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" cried Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Then lock her up," said Langwidere to her soldiers, and they
led Dorothy to a high tower at the north of the palace and locked
her securely within.</p>

<p>The soldiers afterward tried to lift Tiktok, but they found the
machine so solid and heavy that they could not stir it. So they
left him standing in the center of the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"People will think I have a new statue," said Langwidere, "so it
won't matter in the least, and Nanda can keep him well
polished."</p>

<p>"What shall we do with the hen?" asked the colonel, who had just
discovered Billina in the work-basket.</p>

<p>"Put her in the chicken-house," answered the Princess. "Someday
I'll have her fried for breakfast."</p>

<p>"She looks rather tough, Your Highness," said Nanda,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"That is a base slander!" cried Billina, struggling frantically
in the colonel's arms. "But the breed of chickens I come from is
said to be poison to all princesses."</p>

<p>"Then," remarked Langwidere, "I will not fry the hen, but keep
her to lay eggs; and if she doesn't do her duty I'll have her
drowned in the horse trough."</p>

<h2>7. Ozma of Oz to the Rescue</h2>

<p>Nanda brought Dorothy bread and water for her supper, and she
slept upon a hard stone couch with a single pillow and a silken
coverlet.</p>

<p>In the morning she leaned out of the window of her prison in the
tower to see if there was any way to escape. The room was not so
very high up, when compared with our modern buildings, but it was
far enough above the trees and farm houses to give her a good view
of the surrounding country.</p>

<p>To the east she saw the forest, with the sands beyond it and the
ocean beyond that. There was even a dark speck upon the shore that
she thought might be the chicken-coop in which she had arrived at
this singular country.</p>

<p>Then she looked to the north, and saw a deep but narrow valley
lying between two rocky mountains, and a third mountain that shut
off the valley at the further end.</p>

<p>Westward the fertile Land of Ev suddenly ended a little way from
the palace, and the girl could see miles and miles of sandy desert
that stretched further than her eyes could reach. It was this
desert, she thought, with much interest, that alone separated her
from the wonderful Land of Oz, and she remembered sorrowfully that
she had been told no one had ever been able to cross this dangerous
waste but herself. Once a cyclone had carried her across it, and a
magical pair of silver shoes had carried her back again. But now
she had neither a cyclone nor silver shoes to assist her, and her
condition was sad indeed. For she had become the prisoner of a
disagreeable princess who insisted that she must exchange her head
for another one that she was not used to, and which might not fit
her at all.</p>

<p>Really, there seemed no hope of help for her from her old
friends in the Land of Oz. Thoughtfully she gazed from her narrow
window. On all the desert not a living thing was stirring.</p>

<p>Wait, though! Something surely WAS stirring on the
desert&mdash;something her eyes had not observed at first. Now it
seemed like a cloud; now it seemed like a spot of silver; now it
seemed to be a mass of rainbow colors that moved swiftly toward
her.</p>

<p>What COULD it be, she wondered?</p>

<p>Then, gradually, but in a brief space of time nevertheless, the
vision drew near enough to Dorothy to make out what it was.</p>

<p>A broad green carpet was unrolling itself upon the desert, while
advancing across the carpet was a wonderful procession that made
the girl open her eyes in amazement as she gazed.</p>

<p>First came a magnificent golden chariot, drawn by a great Lion
and an immense Tiger, who stood shoulder to shoulder and trotted
along as gracefully as a well-matched team of thoroughbred horses.
And standing upright within the chariot was a beautiful girl
clothed in flowing robes of silver gauze and wearing a jeweled
diadem upon her dainty head. She held in one hand the satin ribbons
that guided her astonishing team, and in the other an ivory wand
that separated at the top into two prongs, the prongs being tipped
by the letters "O" and "Z", made of glistening diamonds set closely
together.</p>

<p>The girl seemed neither older nor larger than Dorothy herself,
and at once the prisoner in the tower guessed that the lovely
driver of the chariot must be that Ozma of Oz of whom she had so
lately heard from Tiktok.</p>

<p>Following close behind the chariot Dorothy saw her old friend
the Scarecrow, riding calmly astride a wooden Saw-Horse, which
pranced and trotted as naturally as any meat horse could have
done.</p>

<p>And then came Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman, with his
funnel-shaped cap tipped carelessly over his left ear, his gleaming
axe over his right shoulder, and his whole body sparkling as
brightly as it had ever done in the old days when first she knew
him.</p>

<p>The Tin Woodman was on foot, marching at the head of a company
of twenty-seven soldiers, of whom some were lean and some fat, some
short and some tall; but all the twenty-seven were dressed in
handsome uniforms of various designs and colors, no two being alike
in any respect.</p>

<p>Behind the soldiers the green carpet rolled itself up again, so
that there was always just enough of it for the procession to walk
upon, in order that their feet might not come in contact with the
deadly, life-destroying sands of the desert.</p>

<p>Dorothy knew at once it was a magic carpet she beheld, and her
heart beat high with hope and joy as she realized she was soon to
be rescued and allowed to greet her dearly beloved friends of
Oz&mdash;the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion.</p>

<p>Indeed, the girl felt herself as good as rescued as soon as she
recognized those in the procession, for she well knew the courage
and loyalty of her old comrades, and also believed that any others
who came from their marvelous country would prove to be pleasant
and reliable acquaintances.</p>

<p>As soon as the last bit of desert was passed and all the
procession, from the beautiful and dainty Ozma to the last soldier,
had reached the grassy meadows of the Land of Ev, the magic carpet
rolled itself together and entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>Then the chariot driver turned her Lion and Tiger into a broad
roadway leading up to the palace, and the others followed, while
Dorothy still gazed from her tower window in eager excitement.</p>

<p>They came quite close to the front door of the palace and then
halted, the Scarecrow dismounting from his Saw-Horse to approach
the sign fastened to the door, that he might read what it said.</p>

<p>Dorothy, just above him, could keep silent no longer.</p>

<p>"Here I am!" she shouted, as loudly as she could. "Here's
Dorothy!"</p>

<p>"Dorothy who?" asked the Scarecrow, tipping his head to look
upward until he nearly lost his balance and tumbled over
backward.</p>

<p>"Dorothy Gale, of course. Your friend from Kansas," she
answered.</p>

<p>"Why, hello, Dorothy!" said the Scarecrow. "What in the world
are you doing up there?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," she called down, "because there's nothing to do. Save
me, my friend&mdash;save me!"</p>

<p>"You seem to be quite safe now," replied the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"But I'm a prisoner. I'm locked in, so that I can't get out,"
she pleaded.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said the Scarecrow. "You might be worse off,
little Dorothy. Just consider the matter. You can't get drowned, or
be run over by a Wheeler, or fall out of an apple-tree. Some folks
would think they were lucky to be up there."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't," declared the girl, "and I want to get down
immed'i'tly and see you and the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly
Lion."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Scarecrow, nodding. "It shall be just as
you say, little friend. Who locked you up?"</p>

<p>"The princess Langwidere, who is a horrid creature," she
answered.</p>

<p>At this Ozma, who had been listening carefully to the
conversation, called to Dorothy from her chariot, asking:</p>

<p>"Why did the Princess lock you up, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Because," exclaimed Dorothy, "I wouldn't let her have my head
for her collection, and take an old, cast-off head in exchange for
it."</p>

<p>"I do not blame you," exclaimed Ozma, promptly. "I will see the
Princess at once, and oblige her to liberate you."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you very, very much!" cried Dorothy, who as soon as
she heard the sweet voice of the girlish Ruler of Oz knew that she
would soon learn to love her dearly.</p>

<p>Ozma now drove her chariot around to the third door of the wing,
upon which the Tin Woodman boldly proceeded to knock.</p>

<p>As soon as the maid opened the door Ozma, bearing in her hand
her ivory wand, stepped into the hall and made her way at once to
the drawing-room, followed by all her company, except the Lion and
the Tiger. And the twenty-seven soldiers made such a noise and a
clatter that the little maid Nanda ran away screaming to her
mistress, whereupon the Princess Langwidere, roused to great anger
by this rude invasion of her palace, came running into the
drawing-room without any assistance whatever.</p>

<p>There she stood before the slight and delicate form of the
little girl from Oz and cried out;&mdash;</p>

<p>"How dare you enter my palace unbidden? Leave this room at once,
or I will bind you and all your people in chains, and throw you
into my darkest dungeons!"</p>

<p>"What a dangerous lady!" murmured the Scarecrow, in a soft
voice.</p>

<p>"She seems a little nervous," replied the Tin Woodman.</p>

<p>But Ozma only smiled at the angry Princess.</p>

<p>"Sit down, please," she said, quietly. "I have traveled a long
way to see you, and you must listen to what I have to say."</p>

<p>"Must!" screamed the Princess, her black eyes flashing with
fury&mdash;for she still wore her No. 17 head. "Must, to ME!"</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Ozma. "I am Ruler of the Land of Oz, and I am
powerful enough to destroy all your kingdom, if I so wish. Yet I
did not come here to do harm, but rather to free the royal family
of Ev from the thrall of the Nome King, the news having reached me
that he is holding the Queen and her children prisoners."</p>

<p>Hearing these words, Langwidere suddenly became quiet.</p>

<p>"I wish you could, indeed, free my aunt and her ten royal
children," said she, eagerly. "For if they were restored to their
proper forms and station they could rule the Kingdom of Ev
themselves, and that would save me a lot of worry and trouble. At
present there are at least ten minutes every day that I must devote
to affairs of state, and I would like to be able to spend my whole
time in admiring my beautiful heads."</p>

<p>"Then we will presently discuss this matter," said Ozma, "and
try to find a way to liberate your aunt and cousins. But first you
must liberate another prisoner&mdash;the little girl you have
locked up in your tower."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Langwidere, readily. "I had forgotten all
about her. That was yesterday, you know, and a Princess cannot be
expected to remember today what she did yesterday. Come with me,
and I will release the prisoner at once."</p>

<p>So Ozma followed her, and they passed up the stairs that led to
the room in the tower.</p>

<p>While they were gone Ozma's followers remained in the
drawing-room, and the Scarecrow was leaning against a form that he
had mistaken for a copper statue when a harsh, metallic voice said
suddenly in his ear:</p>

<p>"Get off my foot, please. You are scratch-ing my pol-ish."</p>

<p>"Oh, excuse me!" he replied, hastily drawing back. "Are you
alive?"</p>

<p>"No," said Tiktok, "I am on-ly a ma-chine. But I can think and
speak and act, when I am pro-per-ly wound up. Just now my ac-tion
is run down, and Dor-o-thy has the key to it."</p>

<p>"That's all right," replied the Scarecrow. "Dorothy will soon be
free, and then she'll attend to your works. But it must be a great
misfortune not to be alive. I'm sorry for you."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Tiktok.</p>

<p>"Because you have no brains, as I have," said the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have," returned Tiktok. "I am fit-ted with Smith
&amp; Tin-ker's Im-proved Com-bi-na-tion Steel Brains. They are
what make me think. What sort of brains are you fit-ted with?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," admitted the Scarecrow. "They were given to me
by the great Wizard of Oz, and I didn't get a chance to examine
them before he put them in. But they work splendidly and my
conscience is very active. Have you a conscience?"</p>

<p>"No," said Tiktok.</p>

<p>"And no heart, I suppose?" added the Tin Woodman, who had been
listening with interest to this conversation.</p>

<p>"No," said Tiktok.</p>

<p>"Then," continued the Tin Woodman, "I regret to say that you are
greatly inferior to my friend the Scarecrow, and to myself. For we
are both alive, and he has brains which do not need to be wound up,
while I have an excellent heart that is continually beating in my
bosom."</p>

<p>"I con-grat-u-late you," replied Tiktok. "I can-not help be-ing
your in-fer-i-or for I am a mere ma-chine. When I am wound up I do
my du-ty by go-ing just as my ma-chin-er-y is made to go. You have
no i-de-a how full of ma-chin-er-y I am."</p>

<p>"I can guess," said the Scarecrow, looking at the machine man
curiously. "Some day I'd like to take you apart and see just how
you are made."</p>

<p>"Do not do that, I beg of you," said Tiktok; "for you could not
put me to-geth-er a-gain, and my use-ful-ness would be
de-stroyed."</p>

<p>"Oh! are you useful?" asked the Scarecrow, surprised.</p>

<p>"Ve-ry," said Tiktok.</p>

<p>"In that case," the Scarecrow kindly promised, "I won't fool
with your interior at all. For I am a poor mechanic, and might mix
you up."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tiktok.</p>

<p>Just then Ozma re-entered the room, leading Dorothy by the hand
and followed closely by the Princess Langwidere.</p>

<h2>8. The Hungry Tiger</h2>

<p>The first thing Dorothy did was to rush into the embrace of the
Scarecrow, whose painted face beamed with delight as he pressed her
form to his straw-padded bosom. Then the Tin Woodman embraced
her&mdash;very gently, for he knew his tin arms might hurt her if
he squeezed too roughly.</p>

<p>These greetings having been exchanged, Dorothy took the key to
Tiktok from her pocket and wound up the machine man's action, so
that he could bow properly when introduced to the rest of the
company. While doing this she told them how useful Tiktok had been
to her, and both the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman shook hands with
the machine once more and thanked him for protecting their
friend.</p>

<p>Then Dorothy asked: "Where is Billina?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the Scarecrow. "Who is Billina?"</p>

<p>"She's a yellow hen who is another friend of mine," answered the
girl, anxiously. "I wonder what has become of her?"</p>

<p>"She is in the chicken house, in the back yard," said the
Princess. "My drawing-room is no place for hens."</p>

<p>Without waiting to hear more Dorothy ran to get Billina, and
just outside the door she came upon the Cowardly Lion, still
hitched to the chariot beside the great Tiger. The Cowardly Lion
had a big bow of blue ribbon fastened to the long hair between his
ears, and the Tiger wore a bow of red ribbon on his tail, just in
front of the bushy end.</p>

<p>In an instant Dorothy was hugging the huge Lion joyfully.</p>

<p>"I'm SO glad to see you again!" she cried.</p>

<p>"I am also glad to see you, Dorothy," said the Lion. "We've had
some fine adventures together, haven't we?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," she replied. "How are you?"</p>

<p>"As cowardly as ever," the beast answered in a meek voice.
"Every little thing scares me and makes my heart beat fast. But let
me introduce to you a new friend of mine, the Hungry Tiger."</p>

<p>"Oh! Are you hungry?" she asked, turning to the other beast, who
was just then yawning so widely that he displayed two rows of
terrible teeth and a mouth big enough to startle anyone.</p>

<p>"Dreadfully hungry," answered the Tiger, snapping his jaws
together with a fierce click.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you eat something?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It's no use," said the Tiger sadly. "I've tried that, but I
always get hungry again."</p>

<p>"Why, it is the same with me," said Dorothy. "Yet I keep on
eating."</p>

<p>"But you eat harmless things, so it doesn't matter," replied the
Tiger. "For my part, I'm a savage beast, and have an appetite for
all sorts of poor little living creatures, from a chipmunk to fat
babies."</p>

<p>"How dreadful!" said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Isn't it, though?" returned the Hungry Tiger, licking his lips
with his long red tongue. "Fat babies! Don't they sound delicious?
But I've never eaten any, because my conscience tells me it is
wrong. If I had no conscience I would probably eat the babies and
then get hungry again, which would mean that I had sacrificed the
poor babies for nothing. No; hungry I was born, and hungry I shall
die. But I'll not have any cruel deeds on my conscience to be sorry
for."</p>

<p>"I think you are a very good tiger," said Dorothy, patting the
huge head of the beast.</p>

<p>"In that you are mistaken," was the reply. "I am a good beast,
perhaps, but a disgracefully bad tiger. For it is the nature of
tigers to be cruel and ferocious, and in refusing to eat harmless
living creatures I am acting as no good tiger has ever before
acted. That is why I left the forest and joined my friend the
Cowardly Lion."</p>

<p>"But the Lion is not really cowardly," said Dorothy. "I have
seen him act as bravely as can be."</p>

<p>"All a mistake, my dear," protested the Lion gravely. "To others
I may have seemed brave, at times, but I have never been in any
danger that I was not afraid."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Dorothy, truthfully. "But I must go and set free
Billina, and then I will see you again."</p>

<p>She ran around to the back yard of the palace and soon found the
chicken house, being guided to it by a loud cackling and crowing
and a distracting hubbub of sounds such as chickens make when they
are excited.</p>

<p>Something seemed to be wrong in the chicken house, and when
Dorothy looked through the slats in the door she saw a group of
hens and roosters huddled in one corner and watching what appeared
to be a whirling ball of feathers. It bounded here and there about
the chicken house, and at first Dorothy could not tell what it was,
while the screeching of the chickens nearly deafened her.</p>

<p>But suddenly the bunch of feathers stopped whirling, and then,
to her amazement, the girl saw Billina crouching upon the prostrate
form of a speckled rooster. For an instant they both remained
motionless, and then the yellow hen shook her wings to settle the
feathers and walked toward the door with a strut of proud defiance
and a cluck of victory, while the speckled rooster limped away to
the group of other chickens, trailing his crumpled plumage in the
dust as he went.</p>

<p>"Why, Billina!" cried Dorothy, in a shocked voice; "have you
been fighting?"</p>

<p>"I really think I have," retorted Billina. "Do you think I'd let
that speckled villain of a rooster lord it over ME, and claim to
run this chicken house, as long as I'm able to peck and scratch?
Not if my name is Bill!"</p>

<p>"It isn't Bill, it's Billina; and you're talking slang, which is
very undig'n'fied," said Dorothy, reprovingly. "Come here, Billina,
and I'll let you out; for Ozma of Oz is here, and has set us
free."</p>

<p>So the yellow hen came to the door, which Dorothy unlatched for
her to pass through, and the other chickens silently watched them
from their corner without offering to approach nearer.</p>

<p>The girl lifted her friend in her arms and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, Billina! how dreadful you look. You've lost a lot of
feathers, and one of your eyes is nearly pecked out, and your comb
is bleeding!"</p>

<p>"That's nothing," said Billina. "Just look at the speckled
rooster! Didn't I do him up brown?"</p>

<p>Dorothy shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don't 'prove of this, at all," she said, carrying Billina
away toward the palace. "It isn't a good thing for you to 'sociate
with those common chickens. They would soon spoil your good
manners, and you wouldn't be respec'able any more."</p>

<p>"I didn't ask to associate with them," replied Billina. "It is
that cross old Princess who is to blame. But I was raised in the
United States, and I won't allow any one-horse chicken of the Land
of Ev to run over me and put on airs, as long as I can lift a claw
in self-defense."</p>

<p>"Very well, Billina," said Dorothy. "We won't talk about it any
more."</p>

<p>Soon they came to the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger to whom
the girl introduced the Yellow Hen.</p>

<p>"Glad to meet any friend of Dorothy's," said the Lion, politely.
"To judge by your present appearance, you are not a coward, as I
am."</p>

<p>"Your present appearance makes my mouth water," said the Tiger,
looking at Billina greedily. "My, my! how good you would taste if I
could only crunch you between my jaws. But don't worry. You would
only appease my appetite for a moment; so it isn't worth while to
eat you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the hen, nestling closer in Dorothy's
arms.</p>

<p>"Besides, it wouldn't be right," continued the Tiger, looking
steadily at Billina and clicking his jaws together.</p>

<p>"Of course not," cried Dorothy, hastily. "Billina is my friend,
and you mustn't ever eat her under any circ'mstances."</p>

<p>"I'll try to remember that," said the Tiger; "but I'm a little
absent-minded, at times."</p>

<p>Then Dorothy carried her pet into the drawing-room of the
palace, where Tiktok, being invited to do so by Ozma, had seated
himself between the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman. Opposite to them
sat Ozma herself and the Princess Langwidere, and beside them there
was a vacant chair for Dorothy.</p>

<p>Around this important group was ranged the Army of Oz, and as
Dorothy looked at the handsome uniforms of the Twenty-Seven she
said:</p>

<p>"Why, they seem to be all officers."</p>

<p>"They are, all except one," answered the Tin Woodman. "I have in
my Army eight Generals, six Colonels, seven Majors and five
Captains, besides one private for them to command. I'd like to
promote the private, for I believe no private should ever be in
public life; and I've also noticed that officers usually fight
better and are more reliable than common soldiers. Besides, the
officers are more important looking, and lend dignity to our
army."</p>

<p>"No doubt you are right," said Dorothy, seating herself beside
Ozma.</p>

<p>"And now," announced the girlish Ruler of Oz, "we will hold a
solemn conference to decide the best manner of liberating the royal
family of this fair Land of Ev from their long imprisonment."</p>

<h2>9. The Royal Family of Ev</h2>

<p>The Tin Woodman was the first to address the meeting.</p>

<p>"To begin with," said he, "word came to our noble and
illustrious Ruler, Ozma of Oz, that the wife and ten
children&mdash;five boys and five girls&mdash;of the former King of
Ev, by name Evoldo, have been enslaved by the Nome King and are
held prisoners in his underground palace. Also that there was no
one in Ev powerful enough to release them. Naturally our Ozma
wished to undertake the adventure of liberating the poor prisoners;
but for a long time she could find no way to cross the great desert
between the two countries. Finally she went to a friendly sorceress
of our land named Glinda the Good, who heard the story and at once
presented Ozma a magic carpet, which would continually unroll
beneath our feet and so make a comfortable path for us to cross the
desert. As soon as she had received the carpet our gracious Ruler
ordered me to assemble our army, which I did. You behold in these
bold warriors the pick of all the finest soldiers of Oz; and, if we
are obliged to fight the Nome King, every officer as well as the
private, will battle fiercely unto death."</p>

<p>Then Tiktok spoke.</p>

<p>"Why should you fight the Nome King?" he asked. "He has done no
wrong."</p>

<p>"No wrong!" cried Dorothy. "Isn't it wrong to imprison a queen
mother and her ten children?"</p>

<p>"They were sold to the Nome King by King Ev-ol-do," replied
Tiktok. "It was the King of Ev who did wrong, and when he
re-al-ized what he had done he jumped in-to the sea and drowned
him-self."</p>

<p>"This is news to me," said Ozma, thoughtfully. "I had supposed
the Nome King was all to blame in the matter. But, in any case, he
must be made to liberate the prisoners."</p>

<p>"My uncle Evoldo was a very wicked man," declared the Princess
Langwidere. "If he had drowned himself before he sold his family,
no one would have cared. But he sold them to the powerful Nome King
in exchange for a long life, and afterward destroyed the life by
jumping into the sea."</p>

<p>"Then," said Ozma, "he did not get the long life, and the Nome
King must give up the prisoners. Where are they confined?"</p>

<p>"No one knows, exactly," replied the Princess. "For the king,
whose name is Roquat of the Rocks, owns a splendid palace
underneath the great mountain which is at the north end of this
kingdom, and he has transformed the queen and her children into
ornaments and bric-a-brac with which to decorate his rooms."</p>

<p>"I'd like to know," said Dorothy, "who this Nome King is?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you," replied Ozma. "He is said to be the Ruler of
the Underground World, and commands the rocks and all that the
rocks contain. Under his rule are many thousands of the Nomes, who
are queerly shaped but powerful sprites that labor at the furnaces
and forges of their king, making gold and silver and other metals
which they conceal in the crevices of the rocks, so that those
living upon the earth's surface can only find them with great
difficulty. Also they make diamonds and rubies and emeralds, which
they hide in the ground; so that the kingdom of the Nomes is
wonderfully rich, and all we have of precious stones and silver and
gold is what we take from the earth and rocks where the Nome King
has hidden them."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Dorothy, nodding her little head
wisely.</p>

<p>"For the reason that we often steal his treasures," continued
Ozma, "the Ruler of the Underground World is not fond of those who
live upon the earth's surface, and never appears among us. If we
wish to see King Roquat of the Rocks, we must visit his own
country, where he is all powerful, and therefore it will be a
dangerous undertaking."</p>

<p>"But, for the sake of the poor prisoners," said Dorothy, "we
ought to do it."</p>

<p>"We shall do it," replied the Scarecrow, "although it requires a
lot of courage for me to go near to the furnaces of the Nome King.
For I am only stuffed with straw, and a single spark of fire might
destroy me entirely."</p>

<p>"The furnaces may also melt my tin," said the Tin Woodman; "but
I am going."</p>

<p>"I can't bear heat," remarked the Princess Langwidere, yawning
lazily, "so I shall stay at home. But I wish you may have success
in your undertaking, for I am heartily tired of ruling this stupid
kingdom, and I need more leisure in which to admire my beautiful
heads."</p>

<p>"We do not need you," said Ozma. "For, if with the aid of my
brave followers I cannot accomplish my purpose, then it would be
useless for you to undertake the journey."</p>

<p>"Quite true," sighed the Princess. "So, if you'll excuse me, I
will now retire to my cabinet. I've worn this head quite awhile,
and I want to change it for another."</p>

<p>When she had left them (and you may be sure no one was sorry to
see her go) Ozma said to Tiktok:</p>

<p>"Will you join our party?"</p>

<p>"I am the slave of the girl Dor-oth-y, who rescued me from
pris-on," replied the machine. "Where she goes I will go."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am going with my friends, of course," said Dorothy,
quickly. "I wouldn't miss the fun for anything. Will you go, too,
Billina?"</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Billina in a careless tone. She was smoothing
down the feathers of her back and not paying much attention.</p>

<p>"Heat is just in her line," remarked the Scarecrow. "If she is
nicely roasted, she will be better than ever."</p>

<p>"Then" said Ozma, "we will arrange to start for the Kingdom of
the Nomes at daybreak tomorrow. And, in the meantime, we will rest
and prepare ourselves for the journey."</p>

<p>Although Princess Langwidere did not again appear to her guests,
the palace servants waited upon the strangers from Oz and did
everything in their power to make the party comfortable. There were
many vacant rooms at their disposal, and the brave Army of
twenty-seven was easily provided for and liberally feasted.</p>

<p>The Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger were unharnessed from the
chariot and allowed to roam at will throughout the palace, where
they nearly frightened the servants into fits, although they did no
harm at all. At one time Dorothy found the little maid Nanda
crouching in terror in a corner, with the Hungry Tiger standing
before her.</p>

<p>"You certainly look delicious," the beast was saying. "Will you
kindly give me permission to eat you?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" cried the maid in reply.</p>

<p>"Then," said the Tiger, yawning frightfully, "please to get me
about thirty pounds of tenderloin steak, cooked rare, with a peck
of boiled potatoes on the side, and five gallons of ice-cream for
dessert."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'll do the best I can!" said Nanda, and she ran away
as fast as she could go.</p>

<p>"Are you so very hungry?" asked Dorothy, in wonder.</p>

<p>"You can hardly imagine the size of my appetite," replied the
Tiger, sadly. "It seems to fill my whole body, from the end of my
throat to the tip of my tail. I am very sure the appetite doesn't
fit me, and is too large for the size of my body. Some day, when I
meet a dentist with a pair of forceps, I'm going to have it
pulled."</p>

<p>"What, your tooth?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"No, my appetite," said the Hungry Tiger.</p>

<p>The little girl spent most of the afternoon talking with the
Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, who related to her all that had
taken place in the Land of Oz since Dorothy had left it. She was
much interested in the story of Ozma, who had been, when a baby,
stolen by a wicked old witch and transformed into a boy. She did
not know that she had ever been a girl until she was restored to
her natural form by a kind sorceress. Then it was found that she
was the only child of the former Ruler of Oz, and was entitled to
rule in his place. Ozma had many adventures, however, before she
regained her father's throne, and in these she was accompanied by a
pumpkin-headed man, a highly magnified and thoroughly educated
Woggle-Bug, and a wonderful sawhorse that had been brought to life
by means of a magic powder. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman had
also assisted her; but the Cowardly Lion, who ruled the great
forest as the King of Beasts, knew nothing of Ozma until after she
became the reigning princess of Oz. Then he journeyed to the
Emerald City to see her, and on hearing she was about to visit the
Land of Ev to set free the royal family of that country, the
Cowardly Lion begged to go with her, and brought along his friend,
the Hungry Tiger, as well.</p>

<p>Having heard this story, Dorothy related to them her own
adventures, and then went out with her friends to find the
Sawhorse, which Ozma had caused to be shod with plates of gold, so
that its legs would not wear out.</p>

<p>They came upon the Sawhorse standing motionless beside the
garden gate, but when Dorothy was introduced to him he bowed
politely and blinked his eyes, which were knots of wood, and wagged
his tail, which was only the branch of a tree.</p>

<p>"What a remarkable thing, to be alive!" exclaimed Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I quiet agree with you," replied the Sawhorse, in a rough but
not unpleasant voice. "A creature like me has no business to live,
as we all know. But it was the magic powder that did it, so I
cannot justly be blamed."</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Dorothy. "And you seem to be of some use,
'cause I noticed the Scarecrow riding upon your back."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I'm of use," returned the Sawhorse; "and I never tire,
never have to be fed, or cared for in any way."</p>

<p>"Are you intel'gent?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Not very," said the creature. "It would be foolish to waste
intelligence on a common Sawhorse, when so many professors need it.
But I know enough to obey my masters, and to gid-dup, or whoa, when
I'm told to. So I'm pretty well satisfied."</p>

<p>That night Dorothy slept in a pleasant little bed-chamber next
to that occupied by Ozma of Oz, and Billina perched upon the foot
of the bed and tucked her head under her wing and slept as soundly
in that position as did Dorothy upon her soft cushions.</p>

<p>But before daybreak every one was awake and stirring, and soon
the adventurers were eating a hasty breakfast in the great
dining-room of the palace. Ozma sat at the head of a long table, on
a raised platform, with Dorothy on her right hand and the Scarecrow
on her left. The Scarecrow did not eat, of course; but Ozma placed
him near her so that she might ask his advice about the journey
while she ate.</p>

<p>Lower down the table were the twenty-seven warriors of Oz, and
at the end of the room the Lion and the Tiger were eating out of a
kettle that had been placed upon the floor, while Billina fluttered
around to pick up any scraps that might be scattered.</p>

<p>It did not take long to finish the meal, and then the Lion and
the Tiger were harnessed to the chariot and the party was ready to
start for the Nome King's Palace.</p>

<p>First rode Ozma, with Dorothy beside her in the golden chariot
and holding Billina fast in her arms. Then came the Scarecrow on
the Sawhorse, with the Tin Woodman and Tiktok marching side by side
just behind him. After these tramped the Army, looking brave and
handsome in their splendid uniforms. The generals commanded the
colonels and the colonels commanded the majors and the majors
commanded the captains and the captains commanded the private, who
marched with an air of proud importance because it required so many
officers to give him his orders.</p>

<p>And so the magnificent procession left the palace and started
along the road just as day was breaking, and by the time the sun
came out they had made good progress toward the valley that led to
the Nome King's domain.</p>

<h2>10. The Giant with the Hammer</h2>

<p>The road led for a time through a pretty farm country, and then
past a picnic grove that was very inviting. But the procession
continued to steadily advance until Billina cried in an abrupt and
commanding manner:</p>

<p>"Wait&mdash;wait!"</p>

<p>Ozma stopped her chariot so suddenly that the Scarecrow's
Sawhorse nearly ran into it, and the ranks of the army tumbled over
one another before they could come to a halt. Immediately the
yellow hen struggled from Dorothy's arms and flew into a clump of
bushes by the roadside.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" called the Tin Woodman, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Why, Billina wants to lay her egg, that's all," said
Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Lay her egg!" repeated the Tin Woodman, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes; she lays one every morning, about this time; and it's
quite fresh," said the girl.</p>

<p>"But does your foolish old hen suppose that this entire
cavalcade, which is bound on an important adventure, is going to
stand still while she lays her egg?" enquired the Tin Woodman,
earnestly.</p>

<p>"What else can we do?" asked the girl. "It's a habit of
Billina's and she can't break herself of it."</p>

<p>"Then she must hurry up," said the Tin Woodman, impatiently.</p>

<p>"No, no!" exclaimed the Scarecrow. "If she hurries she may lay
scrambled eggs."</p>

<p>"That's nonsense," said Dorothy. "But Billina won't be long, I'm
sure."</p>

<p>So they stood and waited, although all were restless and anxious
to proceed. And by and by the yellow hen came from the bushes
saying:</p>

<p>"Kut-kut, kut, ka-daw-kutt! Kut, kut, kut&mdash;ka-daw-kut!"</p>

<p>"What is she doing&mdash;singing her lay?" asked the
Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"For-ward&mdash;march!" shouted the Tin Woodman, waving his axe,
and the procession started just as Dorothy had once more grabbed
Billina in her arms.</p>

<p>"Isn't anyone going to get my egg?" cried the hen, in great
excitement.</p>

<p>"I'll get it," said the Scarecrow; and at his command the
Sawhorse pranced into the bushes. The straw man soon found the egg,
which he placed in his jacket pocket. The cavalcade, having moved
rapidly on, was even then far in advance; but it did not take the
Sawhorse long to catch up with it, and presently the Scarecrow was
riding in his accustomed place behind Ozma's chariot.</p>

<p>"What shall I do with the egg?" he asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I do not know," the girl answered. "Perhaps the Hungry Tiger
would like it."</p>

<p>"It would not be enough to fill one of my back teeth," remarked
the Tiger. "A bushel of them, hard boiled, might take a little of
the edge off my appetite; but one egg isn't good for anything at
all, that I know of."</p>

<p>"No; it wouldn't even make a sponge cake," said the Scarecrow,
thoughtfully. "The Tin Woodman might carry it with his axe and
hatch it; but after all I may as well keep it myself for a
souvenir." So he left it in his pocket.</p>

<p>They had now reached that part of the valley that lay between
the two high mountains which Dorothy had seen from her tower
window. At the far end was the third great mountain, which blocked
the valley and was the northern edge of the Land of Ev. It was
underneath this mountain that the Nome King's palace was said to
be; but it would be some time before they reached that place.</p>

<p>The path was becoming rocky and difficult for the wheels of the
chariot to pass over, and presently a deep gulf appeared at their
feet which was too wide for them to leap. So Ozma took a small
square of green cloth from her pocket and threw it upon the ground.
At once it became the magic carpet, and unrolled itself far enough
for all the cavalcade to walk upon. The chariot now advanced, and
the green carpet unrolled before it, crossing the gulf on a level
with its banks, so that all passed over in safety.</p>

<p>"That's easy enough," said the Scarecrow. "I wonder what will
happen next."</p>

<p>He was not long in making the discovery, for the sides of the
mountain came closer together until finally there was but a narrow
path between them, along which Ozma and her party were forced to
pass in single file.</p>

<p>They now heard a low and deep "thump!&mdash;thump!&mdash;thump!"
which echoed throughout the valley and seemed to grow louder as
they advanced. Then, turning a corner of rock, they saw before them
a huge form, which towered above the path for more than a hundred
feet. The form was that of a gigantic man built out of plates of
cast iron, and it stood with one foot on either side of the narrow
road and swung over its right shoulder an immense iron mallet, with
which it constantly pounded the earth. These resounding blows
explained the thumping sounds they had heard, for the mallet was
much bigger than a barrel, and where it struck the path between the
rocky sides of the mountain it filled all the space through which
our travelers would be obliged to pass.</p>

<p>Of course they at once halted, a safe distance away from the
terrible iron mallet. The magic carpet would do them no good in
this case, for it was only meant to protect them from any dangers
upon the ground beneath their feet, and not from dangers that
appeared in the air above them.</p>

<p>"Wow!" said the Cowardly Lion, with a shudder. "It makes me
dreadfully nervous to see that big hammer pounding so near my head.
One blow would crush me into a door-mat."</p>

<p>"The ir-on gi-ant is a fine fel-low," said Tiktok, "and works as
stead-i-ly as a clock. He was made for the Nome King by Smith &amp;
Tin-ker, who made me, and his du-ty is to keep folks from find-ing
the un-der-ground pal-ace. Is he not a great work of art?"</p>

<p>"Can he think, and speak, as you do?" asked Ozma, regarding the
giant with wondering eyes.</p>

<p>"No," replied the machine; "he is on-ly made to pound the road,
and has no think-ing or speak-ing at-tach-ment. But he pounds ve-ry
well, I think."</p>

<p>"Too well," observed the Scarecrow. "He is keeping us from going
farther. Is there no way to stop his machinery?"</p>

<p>"On-ly the Nome King, who has the key, can do that," answered
Tiktok.</p>

<p>"Then," said Dorothy, anxiously, "what shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me for a few minutes," said the Scarecrow, "and I will
think it over."</p>

<p>He retired, then, to a position in the rear, where he turned his
painted face to the rocks and began to think.</p>

<p>Meantime the giant continued to raise his iron mallet high in
the air and to strike the path terrific blows that echoed through
the mountains like the roar of a cannon. Each time the mallet
lifted, however, there was a moment when the path beneath the
monster was free, and perhaps the Scarecrow had noticed this, for
when he came back to the others he said:</p>

<p>"The matter is a very simple one, after all. We have but to run
under the hammer, one at a time, when it is lifted, and pass to the
other side before it falls again."</p>

<p>"It will require quick work, if we escape the blow," said the
Tin Woodman, with a shake of his head. "But it really seems the
only thing to be done. Who will make the first attempt?"</p>

<p>They looked at one another hesitatingly for a moment. Then the
Cowardly Lion, who was trembling like a leaf in the wind, said to
them:</p>

<p>"I suppose the head of the procession must go first&mdash;and
that's me. But I'm terribly afraid of the big hammer!"</p>

<p>"What will become of me?" asked Ozma. "You might rush under the
hammer yourself, but the chariot would surely be crushed."</p>

<p>"We must leave the chariot," said the Scarecrow. "But you two
girls can ride upon the backs of the Lion and the Tiger."</p>

<p>So this was decided upon, and Ozma, as soon as the Lion was
unfastened from the chariot, at once mounted the beast's back and
said she was ready.</p>

<p>"Cling fast to his mane," advised Dorothy. "I used to ride him
myself, and that's the way I held on."</p>

<p>So Ozma clung fast to the mane, and the lion crouched in the
path and eyed the swinging mallet carefully until he knew just the
instant it would begin to rise in the air.</p>

<p>Then, before anyone thought he was ready, he made a sudden leap
straight between the iron giant's legs, and before the mallet
struck the ground again the Lion and Ozma were safe on the other
side.</p>

<p>The Tiger went next. Dorothy sat upon his back and locked her
arms around his striped neck, for he had no mane to cling to. He
made the leap straight and true as an arrow from a bow, and ere
Dorothy realized it she was out of danger and standing by Ozma's
side.</p>

<p>Now came the Scarecrow on the Sawhorse, and while they made the
dash in safety they were within a hair's breadth of being caught by
the descending hammer.</p>

<p>Tiktok walked up to the very edge of the spot the hammer struck,
and as it was raised for the next blow he calmly stepped forward
and escaped its descent. That was an idea for the Tin Woodman to
follow, and he also crossed in safety while the great hammer was in
the air. But when it came to the twenty-six officers and the
private, their knees were so weak that they could not walk a
step.</p>

<p>"In battle we are wonderfully courageous," said one of the
generals, "and our foes find us very terrible to face. But war is
one thing and this is another. When it comes to being pounded upon
the head by an iron hammer, and smashed into pancakes, we naturally
object."</p>

<p>"Make a run for it," urged the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Our knees shake so that we cannot run," answered a captain. "If
we should try it we would all certainly be pounded to a jelly."</p>

<p>"Well, well," sighed the Cowardly Lion, "I see, friend Tiger,
that we must place ourselves in great danger to rescue this bold
army. Come with me, and we will do the best we can."</p>

<p>So, Ozma and Dorothy having already dismounted from their backs,
the Lion and the Tiger leaped back again under the awful hammer and
returned with two generals clinging to their necks. They repeated
this daring passage twelve times, when all the officers had been
carried beneath the giant's legs and landed safely on the further
side. By that time the beasts were very tired, and panted so hard
that their tongues hung out of their great mouths.</p>

<p>"But what is to become of the private?" asked Ozma.</p>

<p>"Oh, leave him there to guard the chariot," said the Lion. "I'm
tired out, and won't pass under that mallet again."</p>

<p>The officers at once protested that they must have the private
with them, else there would be no one for them to command. But
neither the Lion or the Tiger would go after him, and so the
Scarecrow sent the Sawhorse.</p>

<p>Either the wooden horse was careless, or it failed to properly
time the descent of the hammer, for the mighty weapon caught it
squarely upon its head, and thumped it against the ground so
powerfully that the private flew off its back high into the air,
and landed upon one of the giant's cast-iron arms. Here he clung
desperately while the arm rose and fell with each one of the rapid
strokes.</p>

<p>The Scarecrow dashed in to rescue his Sawhorse, and had his left
foot smashed by the hammer before he could pull the creature out of
danger. They then found that the Sawhorse had been badly dazed by
the blow; for while the hard wooden knot of which his head was
formed could not be crushed by the hammer, both his ears were
broken off and he would be unable to hear a sound until some new
ones were made for him. Also his left knee was cracked, and had to
be bound up with a string.</p>

<p>Billina having fluttered under the hammer, it now remained only
to rescue the private who was riding upon the iron giant's arm,
high in the air.</p>

<p>The Scarecrow lay flat upon the ground and called to the man to
jump down upon his body, which was soft because it was stuffed with
straw. This the private managed to do, waiting until a time when he
was nearest the ground and then letting himself drop upon the
Scarecrow. He accomplished the feat without breaking any bones, and
the Scarecrow declared he was not injured in the least.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Tin Woodman having by this time fitted new ears
to the Sawhorse, the entire party proceeded upon its way, leaving
the giant to pound the path behind them.</p>

<h2>11. The Nome King</h2>

<p>By and by, when they drew near to the mountain that blocked
their path and which was the furthermost edge of the Kingdom of Ev,
the way grew dark and gloomy for the reason that the high peaks on
either side shut out the sunshine. And it was very silent, too, as
there were no birds to sing or squirrels to chatter, the trees
being left far behind them and only the bare rocks remaining.</p>

<p>Ozma and Dorothy were a little awed by the silence, and all the
others were quiet and grave except the Sawhorse, which, as it
trotted along with the Scarecrow upon his back, hummed a queer
song, of which this was the chorus:</p>

<blockquote>"Would a wooden horse in a woodland go?<br>
Aye, aye! I sigh, he would, although<br>
Had he not had a wooden head<br>
He'd mount the mountain top instead."</blockquote>

<p>But no one paid any attention to this because they were now
close to the Nome King's dominions, and his splendid underground
palace could not be very far away.</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard a shout of jeering laughter, and stopped
short. They would have to stop in a minute, anyway, for the huge
mountain barred their further progress and the path ran close up to
a wall of rock and ended.</p>

<p>"Who was that laughing?" asked Ozma.</p>

<p>There was no reply, but in the gloom they could see strange
forms flit across the face of the rock. Whatever the creations
might be they seemed very like the rock itself, for they were the
color of rocks and their shapes were as rough and rugged as if they
had been broken away from the side of the mountain. They kept close
to the steep cliff facing our friends, and glided up and down, and
this way and that, with a lack of regularity that was quite
confusing. And they seemed not to need places to rest their feet,
but clung to the surface of the rock as a fly does to a
window-pane, and were never still for a moment.</p>

<p>"Do not mind them," said Tiktok, as Dorothy shrank back. "They
are on-ly the Nomes."</p>

<p>"And what are Nomes?" asked the girl, half frightened.</p>

<p>"They are rock fair-ies, and serve the Nome King," replied the
machine. "But they will do us no harm. You must call for the King,
be-cause with-out him you can ne-ver find the en-trance to the
pal-ace."</p>

<p>"YOU call," said Dorothy to Ozma.</p>

<p>Just then the Nomes laughed again, and the sound was so weird
and disheartening that the twenty-six officers commanded the
private to "right-about-face!" and they all started to run as fast
as they could.</p>

<p>The Tin Woodman at once pursued his army and cried "halt!" and
when they had stopped their flight he asked: "Where are you
going?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I find I've forgotten the brush for my whiskers," said
a general, trembling with fear. "S-s-so we are g-going back after
it!"</p>

<p>"That is impossible," replied the Tin Woodman. "For the giant
with the hammer would kill you all if you tried to pass him."</p>

<p>"Oh! I'd forgotten the giant," said the general, turning
pale.</p>

<p>"You seem to forget a good many things," remarked the Tin
Woodman. "I hope you won't forget that you are brave men."</p>

<p>"Never!" cried the general, slapping his gold-embroidered
chest.</p>

<p>"Never!" cried all the other officers, indignantly slapping
their chests.</p>

<p>"For my part," said the private, meekly, "I must obey my
officers; so when I am told to run, I run; and when I am told to
fight, I fight."</p>

<p>"That is right," agreed the Tin Woodman. "And now you must all
come back to Ozma, and obey HER orders. And if you try to run away
again I will have her reduce all the twenty-six officers to
privates, and make the private your general."</p>

<p>This terrible threat so frightened them that they at once
returned to where Ozma was standing beside the Cowardly Lion.</p>

<p>Then Ozma cried out in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"I demand that the Nome King appear to us!"</p>

<p>There was no reply, except that the shifting Nomes upon the
mountain laughed in derision.</p>

<p>"You must not command the Nome King," said Tiktok, "for you do
not rule him, as you do your own peo-ple."</p>

<p>So Ozma called again, saying:</p>

<p>"I request the Nome King to appear to us."</p>

<p>Only the mocking laughter replied to her, and the shadowy Nomes
continued to flit here and there upon the rocky cliff.</p>

<p>"Try en-treat-y," said Tiktok to Ozma. "If he will not come at
your re-quest, then the Nome King may list-en to your
plead-ing."</p>

<p>Ozma looked around her proudly.</p>

<p>"Do you wish your ruler to plead with this wicked Nome King?"
she asked. "Shall Ozma of Oz humble herself to a creature who lives
in an underground kingdom?"</p>

<p>"No!" they all shouted, with big voices; and the Scarecrow
added:</p>

<p>"If he will not come, we will dig him out of his hole, like a
fox, and conquer his stubbornness. But our sweet little ruler must
always maintain her dignity, just as I maintain mine."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid to plead with him," said Dorothy. "I'm only a
little girl from Kansas, and we've got more dignity at home than we
know what to do with. I'LL call the Nome King."</p>

<p>"Do," said the Hungry Tiger; "and if he makes hash of you I'll
willingly eat you for breakfast tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>So Dorothy stepped forward and said:</p>

<p>"PLEASE Mr. Nome King, come here and see us."</p>

<p>The Nomes started to laugh again; but a low growl came from the
mountain, and in a flash they had all vanished from sight and were
silent.</p>

<p>Then a door in the rock opened, and a voice cried:</p>

<p>"Enter!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it a trick?" asked the Tin Woodman.</p>

<p>"Never mind," replied Ozma. "We came here to rescue the poor
Queen of Ev and her ten children, and we must run some risks to do
so."</p>

<p>"The Nome King is hon-est and good na-tured," said Tiktok. "You
can trust him to do what is right."</p>

<p>So Ozma led the way, hand in hand with Dorothy, and they passed
through the arched doorway of rock and entered a long passage which
was lighted by jewels set in the walls and having lamps behind
them. There was no one to escort them, or to show them the way, but
all the party pressed through the passage until they came to a
round, domed cavern that was grandly furnished.</p>

<p>In the center of this room was a throne carved out of a solid
boulder of rock, rude and rugged in shape but glittering with great
rubies and diamonds and emeralds on every part of its surface. And
upon the throne sat the Nome King.</p>

<p>This important monarch of the Underground World was a little fat
man clothed in gray-brown garments that were the exact color of the
rock throne in which he was seated. His bushy hair and flowing
beard were also colored like the rocks, and so was his face. He
wore no crown of any sort, and his only ornament was a broad,
jewel-studded belt that encircled his fat little body. As for his
features, they seemed kindly and good humored, and his eyes were
turned merrily upon his visitors as Ozma and Dorothy stood before
him with their followers ranged in close order behind them.</p>

<p>"Why, he looks just like Santa Claus&mdash;only he isn't the
same color!" whispered Dorothy to her friend; but the Nome King
heard the speech, and it made him laugh aloud.</p>

<blockquote>"'He had a red face and a round little belly<br>
That shook when he laughed like a bowl full of
jelly!'"</blockquote>

<p>quoth the monarch, in a pleasant voice; and they could all see
that he really did shake like jelly when he laughed.</p>

<p>Both Ozma and Dorothy were much relieved to find the Nome King
so jolly, and a minute later he waved his right hand and the girls
each found a cushioned stool at her side.</p>

<p>"Sit down, my dears," said the King, "and tell me why you have
come all this way to see me, and what I can do to make you
happy."</p>

<p>While they seated themselves the Nome King picked up a pipe, and
taking a glowing red coal out of his pocket he placed it in the
bowl of the pipe and began puffing out clouds of smoke that curled
in rings above his head. Dorothy thought this made the little
monarch look more like Santa Claus than ever; but Ozma now began
speaking, and every one listened intently to her words.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," said she, "I am the ruler of the Land of Oz, and
I have come here to ask you to release the good Queen of Ev and her
ten children, whom you have enchanted and hold as your
prisoners."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; you are mistaken about that," replied the King. "They
are not my prisoners, but my slaves, whom I purchased from the King
of Ev."</p>

<p>"But that was wrong," said Ozma.</p>

<p>"According to the laws of Ev, the king can do no wrong,"
answered the monarch, eying a ring of smoke he had just blown from
his mouth; "so that he had a perfect right to sell his family to me
in exchange for a long life."</p>

<p>"You cheated him, though," declared Dorothy; "for the King of Ev
did not have a long life. He jumped into the sea and was
drowned."</p>

<p>"That was not my fault," said the Nome King, crossing his legs
and smiling contentedly. "I gave him the long life, all right; but
he destroyed it."</p>

<p>"Then how could it be a long life?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Easily enough," was the reply. "Now suppose, my dear, that I
gave you a pretty doll in exchange for a lock of your hair, and
that after you had received the doll you smashed it into pieces and
destroyed it. Could you say that I had not given you a pretty
doll?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Dorothy.</p>

<p>"And could you, in fairness, ask me to return to you the lock of
hair, just because you had smashed the doll?"</p>

<p>"No," said Dorothy, again.</p>

<p>"Of course not," the Nome King returned. "Nor will I give up the
Queen and her children because the King of Ev destroyed his long
life by jumping into the sea. They belong to me and I shall keep
them."</p>

<p>"But you are treating them cruelly," said Ozma, who was much
distressed by the King's refusal.</p>

<p>"In what way?" he asked.</p>

<p>"By making them your slaves," said she.</p>

<p>"Cruelty," remarked the monarch, puffing out wreathes of smoke
and watching them float into the air, "is a thing I can't abide.
So, as slaves must work hard, and the Queen of Ev and her children
were delicate and tender, I transformed them all into articles of
ornament and bric-a-brac and scattered them around the various
rooms of my palace. Instead of being obliged to labor, they merely
decorate my apartments, and I really think I have treated them with
great kindness."</p>

<p>"But what a dreadful fate is theirs!" exclaimed Ozma, earnestly.
"And the Kingdom of Ev is in great need of its royal family to
govern it. If you will liberate them, and restore them to their
proper forms, I will give you ten ornaments to replace each one you
lose."</p>

<p>The Nome King looked grave.</p>

<p>"Suppose I refuse?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Then," said Ozma, firmly, "I am here with my friends and my
army to conquer your kingdom and oblige you to obey my wishes."</p>

<p>The Nome King laughed until he choked; and he choked until he
coughed; and he coughed until his face turned from grayish-brown to
bright red. And then he wiped his eyes with a rock-colored
handkerchief and grew grave again.</p>

<p>"You are as brave as you are pretty, my dear," he said to Ozma.
"But you have little idea of the extent of the task you have
undertaken. Come with me for a moment."</p>

<p>He arose and took Ozma's hand, leading her to a little door at
one side of the room. This he opened and they stepped out upon a
balcony, from whence they obtained a wonderful view of the
Underground World.</p>

<p>A vast cave extended for miles and miles under the mountain, and
in every direction were furnaces and forges glowing brightly and
Nomes hammering upon precious metals or polishing gleaming jewels.
All around the walls of the cave were thousands of doors of silver
and gold, built into the solid rock, and these extended in rows far
away into the distance, as far as Ozma's eyes could follow
them.</p>

<p>While the little maid from Oz gazed wonderingly upon this scene
the Nome King uttered a shrill whistle, and at once all the silver
and gold doors flew open and solid ranks of Nome soldiers marched
out from every one. So great were their numbers that they quickly
filled the immense underground cavern and forced the busy workmen
to abandon their tasks.</p>

<p>Although this tremendous army consisted of rock-colored Nomes,
all squat and fat, they were clothed in glittering armor of
polished steel, inlaid with beautiful gems. Upon his brow each wore
a brilliant electric light, and they bore sharp spears and swords
and battle-axes of solid bronze. It was evident they were perfectly
trained, for they stood in straight rows, rank after rank, with
their weapons held erect and true, as if awaiting but the word of
command to level them upon their foes.</p>

<p>"This," said the Nome King, "is but a small part of my army. No
ruler upon Earth has ever dared to fight me, and no ruler ever
will, for I am too powerful to oppose."</p>

<p>He whistled again, and at once the martial array filed through
the silver and gold doorways and disappeared, after which the
workmen again resumed their labors at the furnaces.</p>

<p>Then, sad and discouraged, Ozma of Oz turned to her friends, and
the Nome King calmly reseated himself on his rock throne.</p>

<p>"It would be foolish for us to fight," the girl said to the Tin
Woodman. "For our brave Twenty-Seven would be quickly destroyed.
I'm sure I do not know how to act in this emergency."</p>

<p>"Ask the King where his kitchen is," suggested the Tiger. "I'm
hungry as a bear."</p>

<p>"I might pounce upon the King and tear him in pieces," remarked
the Cowardly Lion.</p>

<p>"Try it," said the monarch, lighting his pipe with another hot
coal which he took from his pocket.</p>

<p>The Lion crouched low and tried to spring upon the Nome King;
but he hopped only a little way into the air and came down again in
the same place, not being able to approach the throne by even an
inch.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said the Scarecrow, thoughtfully, "that our
best plan is to wheedle his Majesty into giving up his slaves,
since he is too great a magician to oppose."</p>

<p>"This is the most sensible thing any of you have suggested,"
declared the Nome King. "It is folly to threaten me, but I'm so
kind-hearted that I cannot stand coaxing or wheedling. If you
really wish to accomplish anything by your journey, my dear Ozma,
you must coax me."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Ozma, more cheerfully. "Let us be friends, and
talk this over in a friendly manner."</p>

<p>"To be sure," agreed the King, his eyes twinkling merrily.</p>

<p>"I am very anxious," she continued, "to liberate the Queen of Ev
and her children who are now ornaments and bric-a-brac in your
Majesty's palace, and to restore them to their people. Tell me,
sir, how this may be accomplished."</p>

<p>The king remained thoughtful for a moment, after which he
asked:</p>

<p>"Are you willing to take a few chances and risks yourself, in
order to set free the people of Ev?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" answered Ozma, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Then," said the Nome King, "I will make you this offer: You
shall go alone and unattended into my palace and examine carefully
all that the rooms contain. Then you shall have permission to touch
eleven different objects, pronouncing at the time the word 'Ev,'
and if any one of them, or more than one, proves to be the
transformation of the Queen of Ev or any of her ten children, then
they will instantly be restored to their true forms and may leave
my palace and my kingdom in your company, without any objection
whatever. It is possible for you, in this way, to free the entire
eleven; but if you do not guess all the objects correctly, and some
of the slaves remain transformed, then each one of your friends and
followers may, in turn, enter the palace and have the same
privileges I grant you."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you! thank you for this kind offer!" said Ozma,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I make but one condition," added the Nome King, his eyes
twinkling.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she enquired.</p>

<p>"If none of the eleven objects you touch proves to be the
transformation of any of the royal family of Ev, then, instead of
freeing them, you will yourself become enchanted, and transformed
into an article of bric-a-brac or an ornament. This is only fair
and just, and is the risk you declared you were willing to
take."</p>

<h2>12. The Eleven Guesses</h2>

<p>Hearing this condition imposed by the Nome King, Ozma became
silent and thoughtful, and all her friends looked at her
uneasily.</p>

<p>"Don't you do it!" exclaimed Dorothy. "If you guess wrong, you
will be enslaved yourself."</p>

<p>"But I shall have eleven guesses," answered Ozma. "Surely I
ought to guess one object in eleven correctly; and, if I do, I
shall rescue one of the royal family and be safe myself. Then the
rest of you may attempt it, and soon we shall free all those who
are enslaved."</p>

<p>"What if we fail?" enquired the Scarecrow. "I'd look nice as a
piece of bric-a-brac, wouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"We must not fail!" cried Ozma, courageously. "Having come all
this distance to free these poor people, it would be weak and
cowardly in us to abandon the adventure. Therefore I will accept
the Nome King's offer, and go at once into the royal palace."</p>

<p>"Come along, then, my dear," said the King, climbing down from
his throne with some difficulty, because he was so fat; "I'll show
you the way."</p>

<p>He approached a wall of the cave and waved his hand. Instantly
an opening appeared, through which Ozma, after a smiling farewell
to her friends, boldly passed.</p>

<p>She found herself in a splendid hall that was more beautiful and
grand than anything she had ever beheld. The ceilings were composed
of great arches that rose far above her head, and all the walls and
floors were of polished marble exquisitely tinted in many colors.
Thick velvet carpets were on the floor and heavy silken draperies
covered the arches leading to the various rooms of the palace. The
furniture was made of rare old woods richly carved and covered with
delicate satins, and the entire palace was lighted by a mysterious
rosy glow that seemed to come from no particular place but flooded
each apartment with its soft and pleasing radiance.</p>

<p>Ozma passed from one room to another, greatly delighted by all
she saw. The lovely palace had no other occupant, for the Nome King
had left her at the entrance, which closed behind her, and in all
the magnificent rooms there appeared to be no other person.</p>

<p>Upon the mantels, and on many shelves and brackets and tables,
were clustered ornaments of every description, seemingly made out
of all sorts of metals, glass, china, stones and marbles. There
were vases, and figures of men and animals, and graven platters and
bowls, and mosaics of precious gems, and many other things.
Pictures, too, were on the walls, and the underground palace was
quite a museum of rare and curious and costly objects.</p>

<p>After her first hasty examination of the rooms Ozma began to
wonder which of all the numerous ornaments they contained were the
transformations of the royal family of Ev. There was nothing to
guide her, for everything seemed without a spark of life. So she
must guess blindly; and for the first time the girl came to realize
how dangerous was her task, and how likely she was to lose her own
freedom in striving to free others from the bondage of the Nome
King. No wonder the cunning monarch laughed good naturedly with his
visitors, when he knew how easily they might be entrapped.</p>

<p>But Ozma, having undertaken the venture, would not abandon it.
She looked at a silver candelabra that had ten branches, and
thought: "This may be the Queen of Ev and her ten children." So she
touched it and uttered aloud the word "Ev," as the Nome King had
instructed her to do when she guessed. But the candelabra remained
as it was before.</p>

<p>Then she wandered into another room and touched a china lamb,
thinking it might be one of the children she sought. But again she
was unsuccessful. Three guesses; four guesses; five, six, seven,
eight, nine and ten she made, and still not one of them was
right!</p>

<p>The girl shivered a little and grew pale even under the rosy
light; for now but one guess remained, and her own fate depended
upon the result.</p>

<p>She resolved not to be hasty, and strolled through all the rooms
once more, gazing earnestly upon the various ornaments and trying
to decide which she would touch. Finally, in despair, she decided
to leave it entirely to chance. She faced the doorway of a room,
shut her eyes tightly, and then, thrusting aside the heavy
draperies, she advanced blindly with her right arm outstretched
before her.</p>

<p>Slowly, softly she crept forward until her hand came in contact
with an object upon a small round table. She did not know what it
was, but in a low voice she pronounced the word "Ev."</p>

<p>The rooms were quite empty of life after that. The Nome King had
gained a new ornament. For upon the edge of the table rested a
pretty grasshopper, that seemed to have been formed from a single
emerald. It was all that remained of Ozma of Oz.</p>

<p>In the throne room just beyond the palace the Nome King suddenly
looked up and smiled.</p>

<p>"Next!" he said, in his pleasant voice.</p>

<p>Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Woodman, who had been
sitting in anxious silence, each gave a start of dismay and stared
into one another's eyes.</p>

<p>"Has she failed?" asked Tiktok.</p>

<p>"So it seems," answered the little monarch, cheerfully. "But
that is no reason one of you should not succeed. The next may have
twelve guesses, instead of eleven, for there are now twelve persons
transformed into ornaments. Well, well! Which of you goes
next?"</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Not so," replied the Tin Woodman. "As commander of Ozma's army,
it is my privilege to follow her and attempt her rescue."</p>

<p>"Away you go, then," said the Scarecrow. "But be careful, old
friend."</p>

<p>"I will," promised the Tin Woodman; and then he followed the
Nome King to the entrance to the palace and the rock closed behind
him.</p>

<h2>13. The Nome King Laughs</h2>

<p>In a moment the King returned to his throne and relighted his
pipe, and the rest of the little band of adventurers settled
themselves for another long wait. They were greatly disheartened by
the failure of their girl Ruler, and the knowledge that she was now
an ornament in the Nome King's palace&mdash;a dreadful, creepy
place in spite of all its magnificence. Without their little leader
they did not know what to do next, and each one, down to the
trembling private of the army, began to fear he would soon be more
ornamental than useful.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Nome King began laughing.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! He, he, he! Ho, ho, ho!"</p>

<p>"What's happened?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Why, your friend, the Tin Woodman, has become the funniest
thing you can imagine," replied the King, wiping the tears of
merriment from his eyes. "No one would ever believe he could make
such an amusing ornament. Next!"</p>

<p>They gazed at each other with sinking hearts. One of the
generals began to weep dolefully.</p>

<p>"What are you crying for?" asked the Scarecrow, indignant at
such a display of weakness.</p>

<p>"He owed me six weeks back pay," said the general, "and I hate
to lose him."</p>

<p>"Then you shall go and find him," declared the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Me!" cried the general, greatly alarmed.</p>

<p>"Certainly. It is your duty to follow your commander.
March!"</p>

<p>"I won't," said the general. "I'd like to, of course; but I just
simply WON'T."</p>

<p>The Scarecrow looked enquiringly at the Nome King.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the jolly monarch. "If he doesn't care to
enter the palace and make his guesses I'll throw him into one of my
fiery furnaces."</p>

<p>"I'll go!&mdash;of course I'm going," yelled the general, as
quick as scat. "Where is the entrance&mdash;where is it? Let me go
at once!"</p>

<p>So the Nome King escorted him into the palace, and again
returned to await the result. What the general did, no one can
tell; but it was not long before the King called for the next
victim, and a colonel was forced to try his fortune.</p>

<p>Thus, one after another, all of the twenty-six officers filed
into the palace and made their guesses&mdash;and became
ornaments.</p>

<p>Meantime the King ordered refreshments to be served to those
waiting, and at his command a rudely shaped Nome entered, bearing a
tray. This Nome was not unlike the others that Dorothy had seen,
but he wore a heavy gold chain around his neck to show that he was
the Chief Steward of the Nome King, and he assumed an air of much
importance, and even told his majesty not to eat too much cake late
at night, or he would be ill.</p>

<p>Dorothy, however, was hungry, and she was not afraid of being
ill; so she ate several cakes and found them good, and also she
drank a cup of excellent coffee made of a richly flavored clay,
browned in the furnaces and then ground fine, and found it most
refreshing and not at all muddy.</p>

<p>Of all the party which had started upon this adventure, the
little Kansas girl was now left alone with the Scarecrow, Tiktok,
and the private for counsellors and companions. Of course the
Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger were still there, but they,
having also eaten some of the cakes, had gone to sleep at one side
of the cave, while upon the other side stood the Sawhorse,
motionless and silent, as became a mere thing of wood. Billina had
quietly walked around and picked up the crumbs of cake which had
been scattered, and now, as it was long after bed-time, she tried
to find some dark place in which to go to sleep.</p>

<p>Presently the hen espied a hollow underneath the King's rocky
throne, and crept into it unnoticed. She could still hear the
chattering of those around her, but it was almost dark underneath
the throne, so that soon she had fallen fast asleep.</p>

<p>"Next!" called the King, and the private, whose turn it was to
enter the fatal palace, shook hands with Dorothy and the Scarecrow
and bade them a sorrowful good-bye, and passed through the rocky
portal.</p>

<p>They waited a long time, for the private was in no hurry to
become an ornament and made his guesses very slowly. The Nome King,
who seemed to know, by some magical power, all that took place in
his beautiful rooms of his palace, grew impatient finally and
declared he would sit up no longer.</p>

<p>"I love ornaments," said he, "but I can wait until tomorrow to
get more of them; so, as soon as that stupid private is
transformed, we will all go to bed and leave the job to be finished
in the morning."</p>

<p>"Is it so very late?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Why, it is after midnight," said the King, "and that strikes me
as being late enough. There is neither night nor day in my kingdom,
because it is under the earth's surface, where the sun does not
shine. But we have to sleep, just the same as the up-stairs people
do, and for my part I'm going to bed in a few minutes."</p>

<p>Indeed, it was not long after this that the private made his
last guess. Of course he guessed wrongly, and of course he at once
became an ornament. So the King was greatly pleased, and clapped
his hands to summon his Chief Steward.</p>

<p>"Show these guests to some of the sleeping apartments," he
commanded, "and be quick about it, too, for I'm dreadfully sleepy
myself."</p>

<p>"You've no business to sit up so late," replied the Steward,
gruffly. "You'll be as cross as a griffin tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>His Majesty made no answer to this remark, and the Chief Steward
led Dorothy through another doorway into a long hall, from which
several plain but comfortable sleeping rooms opened. The little
girl was given the first room, and the Scarecrow and Tiktok the
next&mdash;although they never slept&mdash;and the Lion and the
Tiger the third. The Sawhorse hobbled after the Steward into a
fourth room, to stand stiffly in the center of it until morning.
Each night was rather a bore to the Scarecrow, Tiktok and the
Sawhorse; but they had learned from experience to pass the time
patiently and quietly, since all their friends who were made of
flesh had to sleep and did not like to be disturbed.</p>

<p>When the Chief Steward had left them alone the Scarecrow
remarked, sadly:</p>

<p>"I am in great sorrow over the loss of my old comrade, the Tin
Woodman. We have had many dangerous adventures together, and
escaped them all, and now it grieves me to know he has become an
ornament, and is lost to me forever."</p>

<p>"He was al-ways an or-na-ment to so-ci-e-ty," said Tiktok.</p>

<p>"True; but now the Nome King laughs at him, and calls him the
funniest ornament in all the palace. It will hurt my poor friend's
pride to be laughed at," continued the Scarecrow, sadly.</p>

<p>"We will make rath-er ab-surd or-na-ments, our-selves,
to-mor-row," observed the machine, in his monotonous voice.</p>

<p>Just then Dorothy ran into their room, in a state of great
anxiety, crying:</p>

<p>"Where's Billina? Have you seen Billina? Is she here?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Then what has become of her?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Why, I thought she was with you," said the Scarecrow. "Yet I do
not remember seeing the yellow hen since she picked up the crumbs
of cake."</p>

<p>"We must have left her in the room where the King's throne is,"
decided Dorothy, and at once she turned and ran down the hall to
the door through which they had entered. But it was fast closed and
locked on the other side, and the heavy slab of rock proved to be
so thick that no sound could pass through it. So Dorothy was forced
to return to her chamber.</p>

<p>The Cowardly Lion stuck his head into her room to try to console
the girl for the loss of her feathered friend.</p>

<p>"The yellow hen is well able to take care of herself," said he;
"so don't worry about her, but try to get all the sleep you can. It
has been a long and weary day, and you need rest."</p>

<p>"I'll prob'ly get lots of rest tomorrow, when I become an
orn'ment," said Dorothy, sleepily. But she lay down upon her couch,
nevertheless, and in spite of all her worries was soon in the land
of dreams.</p>

<h2>14. Dorothy Tries to be Brave</h2>

<p>Meantime the Chief Steward had returned to the throne room,
where he said to the King:</p>

<p>"You are a fool to waste so much time upon these people."</p>

<p>"What!" cried his Majesty, in so enraged a voice that it awoke
Billina, who was asleep under his throne. "How dare you call me a
fool?"</p>

<p>"Because I like to speak the truth," said the Steward. "Why
didn't you enchant them all at once, instead of allowing them to go
one by one into the palace and guess which ornaments are the Queen
of Ev and her children?"</p>

<p>"Why, you stupid rascal, it is more fun this way," returned the
King, "and it serves to keep me amused for a long time."</p>

<p>"But suppose some of them happen to guess aright," persisted the
Steward; "then you would lose your old ornaments and these new
ones, too."</p>

<p>"There is no chance of their guessing aright," replied the
monarch, with a laugh. "How could they know that the Queen of Ev
and her family are all ornaments of a royal purple color?"</p>

<p>"But there are no other purple ornaments in the palace," said
the Steward.</p>

<p>"There are many other colors, however, and the purple ones are
scattered throughout the rooms, and are of many different shapes
and sizes. Take my word for it, Steward, they will never think of
choosing the purple ornaments."</p>

<p>Billina, squatting under the throne, had listened carefully to
all this talk, and now chuckled softly to herself as she heard the
King disclose his secret.</p>

<p>"Still, you are acting foolishly by running the chance,"
continued the Steward, roughly; "and it is still more foolish of
you to transform all those people from Oz into green
ornaments."</p>

<p>"I did that because they came from the Emerald City," replied
the King; "and I had no green ornaments in my collection until now.
I think they will look quite pretty, mixed with the others. Don't
you?"</p>

<p>The Steward gave an angry grunt.</p>

<p>"Have your own way, since you are the King," he growled. "But if
you come to grief through your carelessness, remember that I told
you so. If I wore the magic belt which enables you to work all your
transformations, and gives you so much other power, I am sure I
would make a much wiser and better King than you are."</p>

<p>"Oh, cease your tiresome chatter!" commanded the King, getting
angry again. "Because you are my Chief Steward you have an idea you
can scold me as much as you please. But the very next time you
become impudent, I will send you to work in the furnaces, and get
another Nome to fill your place. Now follow me to my chamber, for I
am going to bed. And see that I am wakened early tomorrow morning.
I want to enjoy the fun of transforming the rest of these people
into ornaments."</p>

<p>"What color will you make the Kansas girl?" asked the
Steward.</p>

<p>"Gray, I think," said his Majesty.</p>

<p>"And the Scarecrow and the machine man?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they shall be of solid gold, because they are so ugly in
real life."</p>

<p>Then the voices died away, and Billina knew that the King and
his Steward had left the room. She fixed up some of her tail
feathers that were not straight, and then tucked her head under her
wing again and went to sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning Dorothy and the Lion and Tiger were given their
breakfast in their rooms, and afterward joined the King in his
throne room. The Tiger complained bitterly that he was half
starved, and begged to go into the palace and become an ornament,
so that he would no longer suffer the pangs of hunger.</p>

<p>"Haven't you had your breakfast?" asked the Nome King.</p>

<p>"Oh, I had just a bite," replied the beast. "But what good is a
bite, to a hungry tiger?"</p>

<p>"He ate seventeen bowls of porridge, a platter full of fried
sausages, eleven loaves of bread and twenty-one mince pies," said
the Steward.</p>

<p>"What more do you want?" demanded the King.</p>

<p>"A fat baby. I want a fat baby," said the Hungry Tiger. "A nice,
plump, juicy, tender, fat baby. But, of course, if I had one, my
conscience would not allow me to eat it. So I'll have to be an
ornament and forget my hunger."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed the King. "I'll have no clumsy beasts
enter my palace, to overturn and break all my pretty nick-nacks.
When the rest of your friends are transformed you can return to the
upper world, and go about your business."</p>

<p>"As for that, we have no business, when our friends are gone,"
said the Lion. "So we do not care much what becomes of us."</p>

<p>Dorothy begged to be allowed to go first into the palace, but
Tiktok firmly maintained that the slave should face danger before
the mistress. The Scarecrow agreed with him in that, so the Nome
King opened the door for the machine man, who tramped into the
palace to meet his fate. Then his Majesty returned to his throne
and puffed his pipe so contentedly that a small cloud of smoke
formed above his head.</p>

<p>Bye and bye he said:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry there are so few of you left. Very soon, now, my fun
will be over, and then for amusement I shall have nothing to do but
admire my new ornaments."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Dorothy, "that you are not so honest as
you pretend to be."</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked the King.</p>

<p>"Why, you made us think it would be easy to guess what ornaments
the people of Ev were changed into."</p>

<p>"It IS easy," declared the monarch, "if one is a good guesser.
But it appears that the members of your party are all poor
guessers."</p>

<p>"What is Tiktok doing now?" asked the girl, uneasily.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied the King, with a frown. "He is standing
perfectly still, in the middle of a room."</p>

<p>"Oh, I expect he's run down," said Dorothy. "I forgot to wind
him up this morning. How many guesses has he made?"</p>

<p>"All that he is allowed except one," answered the King. "Suppose
you go in and wind him up, and then you can stay there and make
your own guesses."</p>

<p>"All right," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"It is my turn next," declared the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Why, you don't want to go away and leave me all alone, do you?"
asked the girl. "Besides, if I go now I can wind up Tiktok, so that
he can make his last guess."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said the Scarecrow, with a sigh. "Run along,
little Dorothy, and may good luck go with you!"</p>

<p>So Dorothy, trying to be brave in spite of her fears, passed
through the doorway into the gorgeous rooms of the palace. The
stillness of the place awed her, at first, and the child drew short
breaths, and pressed her hand to her heart, and looked all around
with wondering eyes.</p>

<p>Yes, it was a beautiful place; but enchantments lurked in every
nook and corner, and she had not yet grown accustomed to the
wizardries of these fairy countries, so different from the quiet
and sensible common-places of her own native land.</p>

<p>Slowly she passed through several rooms until she came upon
Tiktok, standing motionless. It really seemed, then, that she had
found a friend in this mysterious palace, so she hastened to wind
up the machine man's action and speech and thoughts.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Dor-oth-y," were his first words. "I have now one
more guess to make."</p>

<p>"Oh, be very careful, Tiktok; won't you?" cried the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes. But the Nome King has us in his power, and he has set a
trap for us. I fear we are all lost." he answered.</p>

<p>"I fear so, too," said Dorothy, sadly.</p>

<p>"If Smith &amp; Tin-ker had giv-en me a guess-ing clock-work
at-tach-ment," continued Tiktok, "I might have de-fied the Nome
King. But my thoughts are plain and sim-ple, and are not of much
use in this case."</p>

<p>"Do the best you can," said Dorothy, encouragingly, "and if you
fail I will watch and see what shape you are changed into."</p>

<p>So Tiktok touched a yellow glass vase that had daisies painted
on one side, and he spoke at the same time the word "Ev."</p>

<p>In a flash the machine man had disappeared, and although the
girl looked quickly in every direction, she could not tell which of
the many ornaments the room contained had a moment before been her
faithful friend and servant.</p>

<p>So all she could do was to accept the hopeless task set her, and
make her guesses and abide by the result.</p>

<p>"It can't hurt very much," she thought, "for I haven't heard any
of them scream or cry out&mdash;not even the poor officers. Dear
me! I wonder if Uncle Henry or Aunt Em will ever know I have become
an orn'ment in the Nome King's palace, and must stand forever and
ever in one place and look pretty&mdash;'cept when I'm moved to be
dusted. It isn't the way I thought I'd turn out, at all; but I
s'pose it can't be helped."</p>

<p>She walked through all the rooms once more, and examined with
care all the objects they contained; but there were so many, they
bewildered her, and she decided, after all, as Ozma had done, that
it could be only guess work at the best, and that the chances were
much against her guessing aright.</p>

<p>Timidly she touched an alabaster bowl and said: "Ev."</p>

<p>"That's one failure, anyhow," she thought. "But how am I to know
which thing is enchanted, and which is not?"</p>

<p>Next she touched the image of a purple kitten that stood on the
corner of a mantel, and as she pronounced the word "Ev" the kitten
disappeared, and a pretty, fair-haired boy stood beside her. At the
same time a bell rang somewhere in the distance, and as Dorothy
started back, partly in surprise and partly in joy, the little one
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Where am I? And who are you? And what has happened to me?"</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" said Dorothy. "I've really done it."</p>

<p>"Done what?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Saved myself from being an ornament," replied the girl, with a
laugh, "and saved you from being forever a purple kitten."</p>

<p>"A purple kitten?" he repeated. "There IS no such thing."</p>

<p>"I know," she answered. "But there was, a minute ago. Don't you
remember standing on a corner of the mantel?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. I am a Prince of Ev, and my name is Evring," the
little one announced, proudly. "But my father, the King, sold my
mother and all her children to the cruel ruler of the Nomes, and
after that I remember nothing at all."</p>

<p>"A purple kitten can't be 'spected to remember, Evring," said
Dorothy. "But now you are yourself again, and I'm going to try to
save some of your brothers and sisters, and perhaps your mother, as
well. So come with me."</p>

<p>She seized the child's hand and eagerly hurried here and there,
trying to decide which object to choose next. The third guess was
another failure, and so was the fourth and the fifth.</p>

<p>Little Evring could not imagine what she was doing, but he
trotted along beside her very willingly, for he liked the new
companion he had found.</p>

<p>Dorothy's further quest proved unsuccessful; but after her first
disappointment was over, the little girl was filled with joy and
thankfulness to think that after all she had been able to save one
member of the royal family of Ev, and could restore the little
Prince to his sorrowing country. Now she might return to the
terrible Nome King in safety, carrying with her the prize she had
won in the person of the fair-haired boy.</p>

<p>So she retraced her steps until she found the entrance to the
palace, and as she approached, the massive doors of rock opened of
their own accord, allowing both Dorothy and Evring to pass the
portals and enter the throne room.</p>

<h2>15. Billina Frightens the Nome King</h2>

<p>Now when Dorothy had entered the palace to make her guesses and
the Scarecrow was left with the Nome King, the two sat in moody
silence for several minutes. Then the monarch exclaimed, in a tone
of satisfaction:</p>

<p>"Very good!"</p>

<p>"Who is very good?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"The machine man. He won't need to be wound up any more, for he
has now become a very neat ornament. Very neat, indeed."</p>

<p>"How about Dorothy?" the Scarecrow enquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, she will begin to guess, pretty soon," said the King,
cheerfully. "And then she will join my collection, and it will be
your turn."</p>

<p>The good Scarecrow was much distressed by the thought that his
little friend was about to suffer the fate of Ozma and the rest of
their party; but while he sat in gloomy reverie a shrill voice
suddenly cried:</p>

<p>"Kut, kut, kut&mdash;ka-daw-kutt! Kut, kut,
kut&mdash;ka-daw-kutt!"</p>

<p>The Nome King nearly jumped off his seat, he was so
startled.</p>

<p>"Good gracious! What's that?" he yelled.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Billina," said the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by making a noise like that?" shouted the
King, angrily, as the yellow hen came from under the throne and
strutted proudly about the room.</p>

<p>"I've got a right to cackle, I guess," replied Billina. "I've
just laid my egg."</p>

<p>"What! Laid an egg! In my throne room! How dare you do such a
thing?" asked the King, in a voice of fury.</p>

<p>"I lay eggs wherever I happen to be," said the hen, ruffling her
feathers and then shaking them into place.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;thunder-ation! Don't you know that eggs are poison?"
roared the King, while his rock-colored eyes stuck out in great
terror.</p>

<p>"Poison! well, I declare," said Billina, indignantly. "I'll have
you know all my eggs are warranted strictly fresh and up to date.
Poison, indeed!"</p>

<p>"You don't understand," retorted the little monarch, nervously.
"Eggs belong only to the outside world&mdash;to the world on the
earth's surface, where you came from. Here, in my underground
kingdom, they are rank poison, as I said, and we Nomes can't bear
them around."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll have to bear this one around," declared Billina;
"for I've laid it."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked the King.</p>

<p>"Under your throne," said the hen.</p>

<p>The King jumped three feet into the air, so anxious was he to
get away from the throne.</p>

<p>"Take it away! Take it away at once!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"I can't," said Billina. "I haven't any hands."</p>

<p>"I'll take the egg," said the Scarecrow. "I'm making a
collection of Billina's eggs. There's one in my pocket now, that
she laid yesterday."</p>

<p>Hearing this, the monarch hastened to put a good distance
between himself and the Scarecrow, who was about to reach under the
throne for the egg when the hen suddenly cried:</p>

<p>"Stop!"</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"Don't take the egg unless the King will allow me to enter the
palace and guess as the others have done," said Billina.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" returned the King. "You're only a hen. How could you
guess my enchantments?"</p>

<p>"I can try, I suppose," said Billina. "And, if I fail, you will
have another ornament."</p>

<p>"A pretty ornament you'd make, wouldn't you?" growled the King.
"But you shall have your way. It will properly punish you for
daring to lay an egg in my presence. After the Scarecrow is
enchanted you shall follow him into the palace. But how will you
touch the objects?"</p>

<p>"With my claws," said the hen; "and I can speak the word 'Ev' as
plainly as anyone. Also I must have the right to guess the
enchantments of my friends, and to release them if I succeed."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the King. "You have my promise."</p>

<p>"Then," said Billina to the Scarecrow, "you may get the
egg."</p>

<p>He knelt down and reached underneath the throne and found the
egg, which he placed in another pocket of his jacket, fearing that
if both eggs were in one pocket they would knock together and get
broken.</p>

<p>Just then a bell above the throne rang briskly, and the King
gave another nervous jump.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" said he, with a rueful face; "the girl has
actually done it."</p>

<p>"Done what?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"She has made one guess that is right, and broken one of my
neatest enchantments. By ricketty, it's too bad! I never thought
she would do it."</p>

<p>"Do I understand that she will now return to us in safety?"
enquired the Scarecrow, joyfully wrinkling his painted face into a
broad smile.</p>

<p>"Of course," said the King, fretfully pacing up and down the
room. "I always keep my promises, no matter how foolish they are.
But I shall make an ornament of the yellow hen to replace the one I
have just lost."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will, and perhaps you won't," murmured Billina,
calmly. "I may surprise you by guessing right."</p>

<p>"Guessing right?" snapped the King. "How could you guess right,
where your betters have failed, you stupid fowl?"</p>

<p>Billina did not care to answer this question, and a moment later
the doors flew open and Dorothy entered, leading the little Prince
Evring by the hand.</p>

<p>The Scarecrow welcomed the girl with a close embrace, and he
would have embraced Evring, too, in his delight. But the little
Prince was shy, and shrank away from the painted Scarecrow because
he did not yet know his many excellent qualities.</p>

<p>But there was little time for the friends to talk, because the
Scarecrow must now enter the palace. Dorothy's success had greatly
encouraged him, and they both hoped he would manage to make at
least one correct guess.</p>

<p>However, he proved as unfortunate as the others except Dorothy,
and although he took a good deal of time to select his objects, not
one did the poor Scarecrow guess aright.</p>

<p>So he became a solid gold card-receiver, and the beautiful but
terrible palace awaited its next visitor.</p>

<p>"It's all over," remarked the King, with a sigh of satisfaction;
"and it has been a very amusing performance, except for the one
good guess the Kansas girl made. I am richer by a great many pretty
ornaments."</p>

<p>"It is my turn, now," said Billina, briskly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd forgotten you," said the King. "But you needn't go if
you don't wish to. I will be generous, and let you off."</p>

<p>"No you won't," replied the hen. "I insist upon having my
guesses, as you promised."</p>

<p>"Then go ahead, you absurd feathered fool!" grumbled the King,
and he caused the opening that led to the palace to appear once
more.</p>

<p>"Don't go, Billina," said Dorothy, earnestly. "It isn't easy to
guess those orn'ments, and only luck saved me from being one
myself. Stay with me and we'll go back to the Land of Ev together.
I'm sure this little Prince will give us a home."</p>

<p>"Indeed I will," said Evring, with much dignity.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, my dear," cried Billina, with a cluck that was
meant for a laugh. "I may not be human, but I'm no fool, if I AM a
chicken."</p>

<p>"Oh, Billina!" said Dorothy, "you haven't been a chicken in a
long time. Not since you&mdash;you've been&mdash;grown up."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that's true," answered Billina, thoughtfully. "But if a
Kansas farmer sold me to some one, what would he call me?&mdash;a
hen or a chicken!"</p>

<p>"You are not a Kansas farmer, Billina," replied the girl, "and
you said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind that, Dorothy. I'm going. I won't say good-bye,
because I'm coming back. Keep up your courage, for I'll see you a
little later."</p>

<p>Then Billina gave several loud "cluck-clucks" that seemed to
make the fat little King MORE nervous than ever, and marched
through the entrance into the enchanted palace.</p>

<p>"I hope I've seen the last of THAT bird," declared the monarch,
seating himself again in his throne and mopping the perspiration
from his forehead with his rock-colored handkerchief. "Hens are
bothersome enough at their best, but when they can talk they're
simply dreadful."</p>

<p>"Billina's my friend," said Dorothy quietly. "She may not always
be 'zactly polite; but she MEANS well, I'm sure."</p>

<h2>16. Purple, Green, and Gold</h2>

<p>The yellow hen, stepping high and with an air of vast
importance, walked slowly over the rich velvet carpets of the
splendid palace, examining everything she met with her sharp little
eyes.</p>

<p>Billina had a right to feel important; for she alone shared the
Nome King's secret and knew how to tell the objects that were
transformations from those that had never been alive. She was very
sure that her guesses would be correct, but before she began to
make them she was curious to behold all the magnificence of this
underground palace, which was perhaps one of the most splendid and
beautiful places in any fairyland.</p>

<p>As she went through the rooms she counted the purple ornaments;
and although some were small and hidden in queer places, Billina
spied them all, and found the entire ten scattered about the
various rooms. The green ornaments she did not bother to count, for
she thought she could find them all when the time came.</p>

<p>Finally, having made a survey of the entire palace and enjoyed
its splendor, the yellow hen returned to one of the rooms where she
had noticed a large purple footstool. She placed a claw upon this
and said "Ev," and at once the footstool vanished and a lovely
lady, tall and slender and most beautifully robed, stood before
her.</p>

<p>The lady's eyes were round with astonishment for a moment, for
she could not remember her transformation, nor imagine what had
restored her to life.</p>

<p>"Good morning, ma'am," said Billina, in her sharp voice. "You're
looking quite well, considering your age."</p>

<p>"Who speaks?" demanded the Queen of Ev, drawing herself up
proudly.</p>

<p>"Why, my name's Bill, by rights," answered the hen, who was now
perched upon the back of a chair; "although Dorothy has put
scollops on it and made it Billina. But the name doesn't matter.
I've saved you from the Nome King, and you are a slave no
longer."</p>

<p>"Then I thank you for the gracious favor," said the Queen, with
a graceful courtesy. "But, my children&mdash;tell me, I beg of
you&mdash;where are my children?" and she clasped her hands in
anxious entreaty.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," advised Billina, pecking at a tiny bug that was
crawling over the chair back. "Just at present they are out of
mischief and perfectly safe, for they can't even wiggle."</p>

<p>"What mean you, O kindly stranger?" asked the Queen, striving to
repress her anxiety.</p>

<p>"They're enchanted," said Billina, "just as you have
been&mdash;all, that is, except the little fellow Dorothy picked
out. And the chances are that they have been good boys and girls
for some time, because they couldn't help it."</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor darlings!" cried the Queen, with a sob of
anguish.</p>

<p>"Not at all," returned the hen. "Don't let their condition make
you unhappy, ma'am, because I'll soon have them crowding 'round to
bother and worry you as naturally as ever. Come with me, if you
please, and I'll show you how pretty they look."</p>

<p>She flew down from her perch and walked into the next room, the
Queen following. As she passed a low table a small green
grasshopper caught her eye, and instantly Billina pounced upon it
and snapped it up in her sharp bill. For grasshoppers are a
favorite food with hens, and they usually must be caught quickly,
before they can hop away. It might easily have been the end of Ozma
of Oz, had she been a real grasshopper instead of an emerald one.
But Billina found the grasshopper hard and lifeless, and suspecting
it was not good to eat she quickly dropped it instead of letting it
slide down her throat.</p>

<p>"I might have known better," she muttered to herself, "for where
there is no grass there can be no live grasshoppers. This is
probably one of the King's transformations."</p>

<p>A moment later she approached one of the purple ornaments, and
while the Queen watched her curiously the hen broke the Nome King's
enchantment and a sweet-faced girl, whose golden hair fell in a
cloud over her shoulders, stood beside them.</p>

<p>"Evanna!" cried the Queen, "my own Evanna!" and she clasped the
girl to her bosom and covered her face with kisses.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Billina, contentedly. "Am I a good
guesser, Mr. Nome King? Well, I guess!"</p>

<p>Then she disenchanted another girl, whom the Queen addressed as
Evrose, and afterwards a boy named Evardo, who was older than his
brother Evring. Indeed, the yellow hen kept the good Queen
exclaiming and embracing for some time, until five Princesses and
four Princes, all looking very much alike except for the difference
in size, stood in a row beside their happy mother.</p>

<p>The Princesses were named, Evanna, Evrose, Evella, Evirene and
Evedna, while the Princes were Evrob, Evington, Evardo and
Evroland. Of these Evardo was the eldest and would inherit his
father's throne and be crowned King of Ev when he returned to his
own country. He was a grave and quiet youth, and would doubtless
rule his people wisely and with justice.</p>

<p>Billina, having restored all of the royal family of Ev to their
proper forms, now began to select the green ornaments which were
the transformations of the people of Oz. She had little trouble in
finding these, and before long all the twenty-six officers, as well
as the private, were gathered around the yellow hen, joyfully
congratulating her upon their release. The thirty-seven people who
were now alive in the rooms of the palace knew very well that they
owed their freedom to the cleverness of the yellow hen, and they
were earnest in thanking her for saving them from the magic of the
Nome King.</p>

<p>"Now," said Billina, "I must find Ozma. She is sure to be here,
somewhere, and of course she is green, being from Oz. So look
around, you stupid soldiers, and help me in my search."</p>

<p>For a while, however, they could discover nothing more that was
green. But the Queen, who had kissed all her nine children once
more and could now find time to take an interest in what was going
on, said to the hen:</p>

<p>"Mayhap, my gentle friend, it is the grasshopper whom you
seek."</p>

<p>"Of course it's the grasshopper!" exclaimed Billina. "I declare,
I'm nearly as stupid as these brave soldiers. Wait here for me, and
I'll go back and get it."</p>

<p>So she went into the room where she had seen the grasshopper,
and presently Ozma of Oz, as lovely and dainty as ever, entered and
approached the Queen of Ev, greeting her as one high born princess
greets another.</p>

<p>"But where are my friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman?"
asked the girl Ruler, when these courtesies had been exchanged.</p>

<p>"I'll hunt them up," replied Billina. "The Scarecrow is solid
gold, and so is Tiktok; but I don't exactly know what the Tin
Woodman is, because the Nome King said he had been transformed into
something funny."</p>

<p>Ozma eagerly assisted the hen in her quest, and soon the
Scarecrow and the machine man, being ornaments of shining gold,
were discovered and restored to their accustomed forms. But, search
as they might, in no place could they find a funny ornament that
might be the transformation of the Tin Woodman.</p>

<p>"Only one thing can be done," said Ozma, at last, "and that is
to return to the Nome King and oblige him to tell us what has
become of our friend."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he won't," suggested Billina.</p>

<p>"He must," returned Ozma, firmly. "The King has not treated us
honestly, for under the mask of fairness and good nature he
entrapped us all, and we would have been forever enchanted had not
our wise and clever friend, the yellow hen, found a way to save
us."</p>

<p>"The King is a villain," declared the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>"His laugh is worse than another man's frown," said the private,
with a shudder.</p>

<p>"I thought he was hon-est, but I was mis-tak-en," remarked
Tiktok. "My thoughts are us-u-al-ly cor-rect, but it is Smith &amp;
Tin-ker's fault if they some-times go wrong or do not work
prop-er-ly."</p>

<p>"Smith &amp; Tinker made a very good job of you," said Ozma,
kindly. "I do not think they should be blamed if you are not quite
perfect."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Tiktok.</p>

<p>"Then," said Billina, in her brisk little voice, "let us all go
back to the Nome King, and see what he has to say for himself."</p>

<p>So they started for the entrance, Ozma going first, with the
Queen and her train of little Princes and Princesses following.
Then came Tiktok, and the Scarecrow with Billina perched upon his
straw-stuffed shoulder. The twenty-seven officers and the private
brought up the rear.</p>

<p>As they reached the hall the doors flew open before them; but
then they all stopped and stared into the domed cavern with faces
of astonishment and dismay. For the room was filled with the
mail-clad warriors of the Nome King, rank after rank standing in
orderly array. The electric lights upon their brows gleamed
brightly, their battle-axes were poised as if to strike down their
foes; yet they remained motionless as statues, awaiting the word of
command.</p>

<p>And in the center of this terrible army sat the little King upon
his throne of rock. But he neither smiled nor laughed. Instead, his
face was distorted with rage, and most dreadful to behold.</p>

<h2>17. The Scarecrow Wins the Fight</h2>

<p>After Billina had entered the palace Dorothy and Evring sat down
to await the success or failure of her mission, and the Nome King
occupied his throne and smoked his long pipe for a while in a
cheerful and contented mood.</p>

<p>Then the bell above the throne, which sounded whenever an
enchantment was broken, began to ring, and the King gave a start of
annoyance and exclaimed, "Rocketty-ricketts!"</p>

<p>When the bell rang a second time the King shouted angrily,
"Smudge and blazes!" and at a third ring he screamed in a fury,
"Hippikaloric!" which must be a dreadful word because we don't know
what it means.</p>

<p>After that the bell went on ringing time after time; but the
King was now so violently enraged that he could not utter a word,
but hopped out of his throne and all around the room in a mad
frenzy, so that he reminded Dorothy of a jumping-jack.</p>

<p>The girl was, for her part, filled with joy at every peal of the
bell, for it announced the fact that Billina had transformed one
more ornament into a living person. Dorothy was also amazed at
Billina's success, for she could not imagine how the yellow hen was
able to guess correctly from all the bewildering number of articles
clustered in the rooms of the palace. But after she had counted
ten, and the bell continued to ring, she knew that not only the
royal family of Ev, but Ozma and her followers also, were being
restored to their natural forms, and she was so delighted that the
antics of the angry King only made her laugh merrily.</p>

<p>Perhaps the little monarch could not be more furious than he was
before, but the girl's laughter nearly drove him frantic, and he
roared at her like a savage beast. Then, as he found that all his
enchantments were likely to be dispelled and his victims every one
set free, he suddenly ran to the little door that opened upon the
balcony and gave the shrill whistle that summoned his warriors.</p>

<p>At once the army filed out of the gold and silver doors in great
numbers, and marched up a winding stairs and into the throne room,
led by a stern featured Nome who was their captain. When they had
nearly filled the throne room they formed ranks in the big
underground cavern below, and then stood still until they were told
what to do next.</p>

<p>Dorothy had pressed back to one side of the cavern when the
warriors entered, and now she stood holding little Prince Evring's
hand while the great Lion crouched upon one side and the enormous
Tiger crouched on the other side.</p>

<p>"Seize that girl!" shouted the King to his captain, and a group
of warriors sprang forward to obey. But both the Lion and Tiger
snarled so fiercely and bared their strong, sharp teeth so
threateningly, that the men drew back in alarm.</p>

<p>"Don't mind them!" cried the Nome King; "they cannot leap beyond
the places where they now stand."</p>

<p>"But they can bite those who attempt to touch the girl," said
the captain.</p>

<p>"I'll fix that," answered the King. "I'll enchant them again, so
that they can't open their jaws."</p>

<p>He stepped out of the throne to do this, but just then the
Sawhorse ran up behind him and gave the fat monarch a powerful kick
with both his wooden hind legs.</p>

<p>"Ow! Murder! Treason!" yelled the King, who had been hurled
against several of his warriors and was considerably bruised. "Who
did that?"</p>

<p>"I did," growled the Sawhorse, viciously. "You let Dorothy
alone, or I'll kick you again."</p>

<p>"We'll see about that," replied the King, and at once he waved
his hand toward the Sawhorse and muttered a magical word. "Aha!" he
continued; "NOW let us see you move, you wooden mule!"</p>

<p>But in spite of the magic the Sawhorse moved; and he moved so
quickly toward the King, that the fat little man could not get out
of his way. Thump&mdash;BANG! came the wooden heels, right against
his round body, and the King flew into the air and fell upon the
head of his captain, who let him drop flat upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" said the King, sitting up and looking surprised.
"Why didn't my magic belt work, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"The creature is made of wood," replied the captain. "Your magic
will not work on wood, you know."</p>

<p>"Ah, I'd forgotten that," said the King, getting up and limping
to his throne. "Very well, let the girl alone. She can't escape us,
anyway."</p>

<p>The warriors, who had been rather confused by these incidents,
now formed their ranks again, and the Sawhorse pranced across the
room to Dorothy and took a position beside the Hungry Tiger.</p>

<p>At that moment the doors that led to the palace flew open and
the people of Ev and the people of Oz were disclosed to view. They
paused, astonished, at sight of the warriors and the angry Nome
King, seated in their midst.</p>

<p>"Surrender!" cried the King, in a loud voice. "You are my
prisoners."</p>

<p>"Go 'long!" answered Billina, from the Scarecrow's shoulder.
"You promised me that if I guessed correctly my friends and I might
depart in safety. And you always keep your promises."</p>

<p>"I said you might leave the palace in safety," retorted the
King; "and so you may, but you cannot leave my dominions. You are
my prisoners, and I will hurl you all into my underground dungeons,
where the volcanic fires glow and the molten lava flows in every
direction, and the air is hotter than blue blazes."</p>

<p>"That will be the end of me, all right," said the Scarecrow,
sorrowfully. "One small blaze, blue or green, is enough to reduce
me to an ash-heap."</p>

<p>"Do you surrender?" demanded the King.</p>

<p>Billina whispered something in the Scarecrow's ear that made him
smile and put his hands in his jacket pockets.</p>

<p>"No!" returned Ozma, boldly answering the King. Then she said to
her army:</p>

<p>"Forward, my brave soldiers, and fight for your Ruler and
yourselves, unto death!"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Most Royal Ozma," replied one of her generals; "but
I find that I and my brother officers all suffer from heart
disease, and the slightest excitement might kill us. If we fight we
may get excited. Would it not be well for us to avoid this grave
danger?"</p>

<p>"Soldiers should not have heart disease," said Ozma.</p>

<p>"Private soldiers are not, I believe, afflicted that way,"
declared another general, twirling his moustache thoughtfully. "If
your Royal Highness desires, we will order our private to attack
yonder warriors."</p>

<p>"Do so," replied Ozma.</p>

<p>"For-ward&mdash;march!" cried all the generals, with one voice.
"For-ward&mdash;march!" yelled the colonels.
"For-ward&mdash;march!" shouted the majors. "For-ward&mdash;march!"
commanded the captains.</p>

<p>And at that the private leveled his spear and dashed furiously
upon the foe.</p>

<p>The captain of the Nomes was so surprised by this sudden
onslaught that he forgot to command his warriors to fight, so that
the ten men in the first row, who stood in front of the private's
spear, fell over like so many toy soldiers. The spear could not go
through their steel armor, however, so the warriors scrambled to
their feet again, and by that time the private had knocked over
another row of them.</p>

<p>Then the captain brought down his battle-axe with such a strong
blow that the private's spear was shattered and knocked from his
grasp, and he was helpless to fight any longer.</p>

<p>The Nome King had left his throne and pressed through his
warriors to the front ranks, so he could see what was going on; but
as he faced Ozma and her friends the Scarecrow, as if aroused to
action by the valor of the private, drew one of Billina's eggs from
his right jacket pocket and hurled it straight at the little
monarch's head.</p>

<p>It struck him squarely in his left eye, where the egg smashed
and scattered, as eggs will, and covered his face and hair and
beard with its sticky contents.</p>

<p>"Help, help!" screamed the King, clawing with his fingers at the
egg, in a struggle to remove it.</p>

<p>"An egg! an egg! Run for your lives!" shouted the captain of the
Nomes, in a voice of horror.</p>

<p>And how they DID run! The warriors fairly tumbled over one
another in their efforts to escape the fatal poison of that awful
egg, and those who could not rush down the winding stair fell off
the balcony into the great cavern beneath, knocking over those who
stood below them.</p>

<p>Even while the King was still yelling for help his throne room
became emptied of every one of his warriors, and before the monarch
had managed to clear the egg away from his left eye the Scarecrow
threw the second egg against his right eye, where it smashed and
blinded him entirely. The King was unable to flee because he could
not see which way to run; so he stood still and howled and shouted
and screamed in abject fear.</p>

<p>While this was going on, Billina flew over to Dorothy, and
perching herself upon the Lion's back the hen whispered eagerly to
the girl:</p>

<p>"Get his belt! Get the Nome King's jeweled belt! It unbuckles in
the back. Quick, Dorothy&mdash;quick!"</p>

<h2>18. The Fate of the Tin Woodman</h2>

<p>Dorothy obeyed. She ran at once behind the Nome King, who was
still trying to free his eyes from the egg, and in a twinkling she
had unbuckled his splendid jeweled belt and carried it away with
her to her place beside the Tiger and Lion, where, because she did
not know what else to do with it, she fastened it around her own
slim waist.</p>

<p>Just then the Chief Steward rushed in with a sponge and a bowl
of water, and began mopping away the broken eggs from his master's
face. In a few minutes, and while all the party stood looking on,
the King regained the use of his eyes, and the first thing he did
was to glare wickedly upon the Scarecrow and exclaim:</p>

<p>"I'll make you suffer for this, you hay-stuffed dummy! Don't you
know eggs are poison to Nomes?"</p>

<p>"Really," said the Scarecrow, "they DON'T seem to agree with
you, although I wonder why."</p>

<p>"They were strictly fresh and above suspicion," said Billina.
"You ought to be glad to get them."</p>

<p>"I'll transform you all into scorpions!" cried the King,
angrily, and began waving his arms and muttering magic words.</p>

<p>But none of the people became scorpions, so the King stopped and
looked at them in surprise.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, you are not wearing your magic belt," replied the Chief
Steward, after looking the King over carefully. "Where is it? What
have you done with it?"</p>

<p>The Nome King clapped his hand to his waist, and his rock
colored face turned white as chalk.</p>

<p>"It's gone," he cried, helplessly. "It's gone, and I am
ruined!"</p>

<p>Dorothy now stepped forward and said:</p>

<p>"Royal Ozma, and you, Queen of Ev, I welcome you and your people
back to the land of the living. Billina has saved you from your
troubles, and now we will leave this drea'ful place, and return to
Ev as soon as poss'ble."</p>

<p>While the child spoke they could all see that she wore the magic
belt, and a great cheer went up from all her friends, which was led
by the voices of the Scarecrow and the private. But the Nome King
did not join them. He crept back onto his throne like a whipped
dog, and lay there bitterly bemoaning his defeat.</p>

<p>"But we have not yet found my faithful follower, the Tin
Woodman," said Ozma to Dorothy, "and without him I do not wish to
go away."</p>

<p>"Nor I," replied Dorothy, quickly. "Wasn't he in the
palace?"</p>

<p>"He must be there," said Billina; "but I had no clue to guide me
in guessing the Tin Woodman, so I must have missed him."</p>

<p>"We will go back into the rooms," said Dorothy. "This magic
belt, I am sure, will help us to find our dear old friend."</p>

<p>So she re-entered the palace, the doors of which still stood
open, and everyone followed her except the Nome King, the Queen of
Ev and Prince Evring. The mother had taken the little Prince in her
lap and was fondling and kissing him lovingly, for he was her
youngest born.</p>

<p>But the others went with Dorothy, and when she came to the
middle of the first room the girl waved her hand, as she had seen
the King do, and commanded the Tin Woodman, whatever form he might
then have, to resume his proper shape. No result followed this
attempt, so Dorothy went into another room and repeated it, and so
through all the rooms of the palace. Yet the Tin Woodman did not
appear to them, nor could they imagine which among the thousands of
ornaments was their transformed friend.</p>

<p>Sadly they returned to the throne room, where the King, seeing
that they had met with failure, jeered at Dorothy, saying:</p>

<p>"You do not know how to use my belt, so it is of no use to you.
Give it back to me and I will let you go free&mdash;you and all the
people who came with you. As for the royal family of Ev, they are
my slaves, and shall remain here."</p>

<p>"I shall keep the belt," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"But how can you escape, without my consent?" asked the
King.</p>

<p>"Easily enough," answered the girl. "All we need to do is to
walk out the way that we came in."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all, is it?" sneered the King. "Well, where is the
passage through which you entered this room?"</p>

<p>They all looked around, but could not discover the place, for it
had long since been closed. Dorothy, however, would not be
dismayed. She waved her hand toward the seemingly solid wall of the
cavern and said:</p>

<p>"I command the passage to open!"</p>

<p>Instantly the order was obeyed; the opening appeared and the
passage lay plainly before them.</p>

<p>The King was amazed, and all the others overjoyed.</p>

<p>"Why, then, if the belt obeys you, were we unable to discover
the Tin Woodman?" asked Ozma.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"See here, girl," proposed the King, eagerly; "give me the belt,
and I will tell you what shape the Tin Woodman was changed into,
and then you can easily find him."</p>

<p>Dorothy hesitated, but Billina cried out:</p>

<p>"Don't you do it! If the Nome King gets the belt again he will
make every one of us prisoners, for we will be in his power. Only
by keeping the belt, Dorothy, will you ever be able to leave this
place in safety."</p>

<p>"I think that is true," said the Scarecrow. "But I have another
idea, due to my excellent brains. Let Dorothy transform the King
into a goose-egg unless he agrees to go into the palace and bring
out to us the ornament which is our friend Nick Chopper, the Tin
Woodman."</p>

<p>"A goose-egg!" echoed the horrified King. "How dreadful!"</p>

<p>"Well, a goose-egg you will be unless you go and fetch us the
ornament we want," declared Billina, with a joyful chuckle.</p>

<p>"You can see for yourself that Dorothy is able to use the magic
belt all right," added the Scarecrow.</p>

<p>The Nome King thought it over and finally consented, for he did
not want to be a goose-egg. So he went into the palace to get the
ornament which was the transformation of the Tin Woodman, and they
all awaited his return with considerable impatience, for they were
anxious to leave this underground cavern and see the sunshine once
more. But when the Nome King came back he brought nothing with him
except a puzzled and anxious expression upon his face.</p>

<p>"He's gone!" he said. "The Tin Woodman is nowhere in the
palace."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" asked Ozma, sternly.</p>

<p>"I'm very sure," answered the King, trembling, "for I know just
what I transformed him into, and exactly where he stood. But he is
not there, and please don't change me into a goose-egg, because
I've done the best I could."</p>

<p>They were all silent for a time, and then Dorothy said:</p>

<p>"There is no use punishing the Nome King any more, and I'm
'fraid we'll have to go away without our friend."</p>

<p>"If he is not here, we cannot rescue him," agreed the Scarecrow,
sadly. "Poor Nick! I wonder what has become of him."</p>

<p>"And he owed me six weeks back pay!" said one of the generals,
wiping the tears from his eyes with his gold-laced coat sleeve.</p>

<p>Very sorrowfully they determined to return to the upper world
without their former companion, and so Ozma gave the order to begin
the march through the passage.</p>

<p>The army went first, and then the royal family of Ev, and
afterward came Dorothy, Ozma, Billina, the Scarecrow and
Tiktok.</p>

<p>They left the Nome King scowling at them from his throne, and
had no thought of danger until Ozma chanced to look back and saw a
large number of the warriors following them in full chase, with
their swords and spears and axes raised to strike down the
fugitives as soon as they drew near enough.</p>

<p>Evidently the Nome King had made this last attempt to prevent
their escaping him; but it did him no good, for when Dorothy saw
the danger they were in she stopped and waved her hand and
whispered a command to the magic belt.</p>

<p>Instantly the foremost warriors became eggs, which rolled upon
the floor of the cavern in such numbers that those behind could not
advance without stepping upon them. But, when they saw the eggs,
all desire to advance departed from the warriors, and they turned
and fled madly into the cavern, and refused to go back again.</p>

<p>Our friends had no further trouble in reaching the end of the
passage, and soon were standing in the outer air upon the gloomy
path between the two high mountains. But the way to Ev lay plainly
before them, and they fervently hoped that they had seen the last
of the Nome King and of his dreadful palace.</p>

<p>The cavalcade was led by Ozma, mounted on the Cowardly Lion, and
the Queen of Ev, who rode upon the back of the Tiger. The children
of the Queen walked behind her, hand in hand. Dorothy rode the
Sawhorse, while the Scarecrow walked and commanded the army in the
absence of the Tin Woodman.</p>

<p>Presently the way began to lighten and more of the sunshine to
come in between the two mountains. And before long they heard the
"thump! thump! thump!" of the giant's hammer upon the road.</p>

<p>"How may we pass the monstrous man of iron?" asked the Queen,
anxious for the safety of her children. But Dorothy solved the
problem by a word to the magic belt.</p>

<p>The giant paused, with his hammer held motionless in the air,
thus allowing the entire party to pass between his cast-iron legs
in safety.</p>

<h2>19. The King of Ev</h2>

<p>If there were any shifting, rock-colored Nomes on the mountain
side now, they were silent and respectful, for our adventurers were
not annoyed, as before, by their impudent laughter. Really the
Nomes had nothing to laugh at, since the defeat of their King.</p>

<p>On the other side they found Ozma's golden chariot, standing as
they had left it. Soon the Lion and the Tiger were harnessed to the
beautiful chariot, in which was enough room for Ozma and the Queen
and six of the royal children.</p>

<p>Little Evring preferred to ride with Dorothy upon the Sawhorse,
which had a long back. The Prince had recovered from his shyness
and had become very fond of the girl who had rescued him, so they
were fast friends and chatted pleasantly together as they rode
along. Billina was also perched upon the head of the wooden steed,
which seemed not to mind the added weight in the least, and the boy
was full of wonder that a hen could talk, and say such sensible
things.</p>

<p>When they came to the gulf, Ozma's magic carpet carried them all
over in safety; and now they began to pass the trees, in which
birds were singing; and the breeze that was wafted to them from the
farms of Ev was spicy with flowers and new-mown hay; and the
sunshine fell full upon them, to warm them and drive away from
their bodies the chill and dampness of the underground kingdom of
the Nomes.</p>

<p>"I would be quite content," said the Scarecrow to Tiktok, "were
only the Tin Woodman with us. But it breaks my heart to leave him
behind."</p>

<p>"He was a fine fel-low," replied Tiktok, "al-though his
ma-ter-i-al was not ve-ry du-ra-ble."</p>

<p>"Oh, tin is an excellent material," the Scarecrow hastened to
say; "and if anything ever happened to poor Nick Chopper he was
always easily soldered. Besides, he did not have to be wound up,
and was not liable to get out of order."</p>

<p>"I some-times wish," said Tiktok, "that I was stuffed with
straw, as you are. It is hard to be made of cop-per."</p>

<p>"I have no reason to complain of my lot," replied the Scarecrow.
"A little fresh straw, now and then, makes me as good as new. But I
can never be the polished gentleman that my poor departed friend,
the Tin Woodman, was."</p>

<p>You may be sure the royal children of Ev and their Queen mother
were delighted at seeing again their beloved country; and when the
towers of the palace of Ev came into view they could not forbear
cheering at the sight. Little Evring, riding in front of Dorothy,
was so overjoyed that he took a curious tin whistle from his pocket
and blew a shrill blast that made the Sawhorse leap and prance in
sudden alarm.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Billina, who had been obliged to flutter
her wings in order to keep her seat upon the head of the frightened
Sawhorse.</p>

<p>"That's my whistle," said Prince Evring, holding it out upon his
hand.</p>

<p>It was in the shape of a little fat pig, made of tin and painted
green. The whistle was in the tail of the pig.</p>

<p>"Where did you get it?" asked the yellow hen, closely examining
the toy with her bright eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, I picked it up in the Nome King's palace, while Dorothy
was making her guesses, and I put it in my pocket," answered the
little Prince.</p>

<p>Billina laughed; or at least she made the peculiar cackle that
served her for a laugh.</p>

<p>"No wonder I couldn't find the Tin Woodman," she said; "and no
wonder the magic belt didn't make him appear, or the King couldn't
find him, either!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" questioned Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Why, the Prince had him in his pocket," cried Billina, cackling
again.</p>

<p>"I did not!" protested little Evring. "I only took the
whistle."</p>

<p>"Well, then, watch me," returned the hen, and reaching out a
claw she touched the whistle and said "Ev."</p>

<p>Swish!</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," said the Tin Woodman, taking off his funnel
cap and bowing to Dorothy and the Prince. "I think I must have been
asleep for the first time since I was made of tin, for I do not
remember our leaving the Nome King."</p>

<p>"You have been enchanted," answered the girl, throwing an arm
around her old friend and hugging him tight in her joy. "But it's
all right, now."</p>

<p>"I want my whistle!" said the little Prince, beginning to
cry.</p>

<p>"Hush!" cautioned Billina. "The whistle is lost, but you may
have another when you get home."</p>

<p>The Scarecrow had fairly thrown himself upon the bosom of his
old comrade, so surprised and delighted was he to see him again,
and Tiktok squeezed the Tin Woodman's hand so earnestly that he
dented some of his fingers. Then they had to make way for Ozma to
welcome the tin man, and the army caught sight of him and set up a
cheer, and everybody was delighted and happy.</p>

<p>For the Tin Woodman was a great favorite with all who knew him,
and his sudden recovery after they had thought he was lost to them
forever was indeed a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>Before long the cavalcade arrived at the royal palace, where a
great crowd of people had gathered to welcome their Queen and her
ten children. There was much shouting and cheering, and the people
threw flowers in their path, and every face wore a happy smile.</p>

<p>They found the Princess Langwidere in her mirrored chamber,
where she was admiring one of her handsomest heads&mdash;one with
rich chestnut hair, dreamy walnut eyes and a shapely hickorynut
nose. She was very glad to be relieved of her duties to the people
of Ev, and the Queen graciously permitted her to retain her rooms
and her cabinet of heads as long as she lived.</p>

<p>Then the Queen took her eldest son out upon a balcony that
overlooked the crowd of subjects gathered below, and said to
them:</p>

<p>"Here is your future ruler, King Evardo Fifteenth. He is fifteen
years of age, has fifteen silver buckles on his jacket and is the
fifteenth Evardo to rule the land of Ev."</p>

<p>The people shouted their approval fifteen times, and even the
Wheelers, some of whom were present, loudly promised to obey the
new King.</p>

<p>So the Queen placed a big crown of gold, set with rubies, upon
Evardo's head, and threw an ermine robe over his shoulders, and
proclaimed him King; and he bowed gratefully to all his subjects
and then went away to see if he could find any cake in the royal
pantry.</p>

<p>Ozma of Oz and her people, as well as Dorothy, Tiktok and
Billina, were splendidly entertained by the Queen mother, who owed
all her happiness to their kind offices; and that evening the
yellow hen was publicly presented with a beautiful necklace of
pearls and sapphires, as a token of esteem from the new King.</p>

<h2>20. The Emerald City</h2>

<p>Dorothy decided to accept Ozma's invitation to return with her
to the Land of Oz. There was no greater chance of her getting home
from Ev than from Oz, and the little girl was anxious to see once
more the country where she had encountered such wonderful
adventures. By this time Uncle Henry would have reached Australia
in his ship, and had probably given her up for lost; so he couldn't
worry any more than he did if she stayed away from him a while
longer. So she would go to Oz.</p>

<p>They bade good-bye to the people of Ev, and the King promised
Ozma that he would ever be grateful to her and render the Land of
Oz any service that might lie within his power.</p>

<p>And then they approached the edge of the dangerous desert, and
Ozma threw down the magic carpet, which at once unrolled far enough
for all of them to walk upon it without being crowded.</p>

<p>Tiktok, claiming to be Dorothy's faithful follower because he
belonged to her, had been permitted to join the party, and before
they started the girl wound up his machinery as far as possible,
and the copper man stepped off as briskly as any one of them.</p>

<p>Ozma also invited Billina to visit the Land of Oz, and the
yellow hen was glad enough to go where new sights and scenes
awaited her.</p>

<p>They began the trip across the desert early in the morning, and
as they stopped only long enough for Billina to lay her daily egg,
before sunset they espied the green slopes and wooded hills of the
beautiful Land of Oz. They entered it in the Munchkin territory,
and the King of the Munchkins met them at the border and welcomed
Ozma with great respect, being very pleased by her safe return. For
Ozma of Oz ruled the King of the Munchkins, the King of the
Winkies, the King of the Quadlings and the King of the Gillikins
just as those kings ruled their own people; and this supreme ruler
of the Land of Oz lived in a great town of her own, called the
Emerald City, which was in the exact center of the four kingdoms of
the Land of Oz.</p>

<p>The Munchkin king entertained them at his palace that night, and
in the morning they set out for the Emerald City, travelling over a
road of yellow brick that led straight to the jewel-studded gates.
Everywhere the people turned out to greet their beloved Ozma, and
to hail joyfully the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly
Lion, who were popular favorites. Dorothy, too, remembered some of
the people, who had befriended her on the occasion of her first
visit to Oz, and they were well pleased to see the little Kansas
girl again, and showered her with compliments and good wishes.</p>

<p>At one place, where they stopped to refresh themselves, Ozma
accepted a bowl of milk from the hands of a pretty dairy-maid. Then
she looked at the girl more closely, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, it's Jinjur&mdash;isn't it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, your Highness," was the reply, as Jinjur dropped a low
curtsy. And Dorothy looked wonderingly at this lively appearing
person, who had once assembled an army of women and driven the
Scarecrow from the throne of the Emerald City, and even fought a
battle with the powerful army of Glinda the Sorceress.</p>

<p>"I've married a man who owns nine cows," said Jinjur to Ozma,
"and now I am happy and contented and willing to lead a quiet life
and mind my own business."</p>

<p>"Where is your husband?" asked Ozma.</p>

<p>"He is in the house, nursing a black eye," replied Jinjur,
calmly. "The foolish man would insist upon milking the red cow when
I wanted him to milk the white one; but he will know better next
time, I am sure."</p>

<p>Then the party moved on again, and after crossing a broad river
on a ferry and passing many fine farm houses that were dome shaped
and painted a pretty green color, they came in sight of a large
building that was covered with flags and bunting.</p>

<p>"I don't remember that building," said Dorothy. "What is
it?"</p>

<p>"That is the College of Art and Athletic Perfection," replied
Ozma. "I had it built quite recently, and the Woggle-Bug is its
president. It keeps him busy, and the young men who attend the
college are no worse off than they were before. You see, in this
country are a number of youths who do not like to work, and the
college is an excellent place for them."</p>

<p>And now they came in sight of the Emerald City, and the people
flocked out to greet their lovely ruler. There were several bands
and many officers and officials of the realm, and a crowd of
citizens in their holiday attire.</p>

<p>Thus the beautiful Ozma was escorted by a brilliant procession
to her royal city, and so great was the cheering that she was
obliged to constantly bow to the right and left to acknowledge the
greetings of her subjects.</p>

<p>That evening there was a grand reception in the royal palace,
attended by the most important persons of Oz, and Jack Pumpkinhead,
who was a little overripe but still active, read an address
congratulating Ozma of Oz upon the success of her generous mission
to rescue the royal family of a neighboring kingdom.</p>

<p>Then magnificent gold medals set with precious stones were
presented to each of the twenty-six officers; and the Tin Woodman
was given a new axe studded with diamonds; and the Scarecrow
received a silver jar of complexion powder. Dorothy was presented
with a pretty coronet and made a Princess of Oz, and Tiktok
received two bracelets set with eight rows of very clear and
sparkling emeralds.</p>

<p>Afterward they sat down to a splendid feast, and Ozma put
Dorothy at her right and Billina at her left, where the hen sat
upon a golden roost and ate from a jeweled platter. Then were
placed the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman and Tiktok, with baskets of
lovely flowers before them, because they did not require food. The
twenty-six officers were at the lower end of the table, and the
Lion and the Tiger also had seats, and were served on golden
platters, that held a half a bushel at one time.</p>

<p>The wealthiest and most important citizens of the Emerald City
were proud to wait upon these famous adventurers, and they were
assisted by a sprightly little maid named Jellia Jamb, whom the
Scarecrow pinched upon her rosy cheeks and seemed to know very
well.</p>

<p>During the feast Ozma grew thoughtful, and suddenly she
asked:</p>

<p>"Where is the private?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he is sweeping out the barracks," replied one of the
generals, who was busy eating a leg of a turkey. "But I have
ordered him a dish of bread and molasses to eat when his work is
done."</p>

<p>"Let him be sent for," said the girl ruler.</p>

<p>While they waited for this command to be obeyed, she
enquired:</p>

<p>"Have we any other privates in the armies?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied the Tin Woodman, "I believe there are three,
altogether."</p>

<p>The private now entered, saluting his officers and the royal
Ozma very respectfully.</p>

<p>"What is your name, my man?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Omby Amby," answered the private.</p>

<p>"Then, Omby Amby," said she, "I promote you to be Captain
General of all the armies of my kingdom, and especially to be
Commander of my Body Guard at the royal palace."</p>

<p>"It is very expensive to hold so many offices," said the
private, hesitating. "I have no money with which to buy
uniforms."</p>

<p>"You shall be supplied from the royal treasury," said Ozma.</p>

<p>Then the private was given a seat at the table, where the other
officers welcomed him cordially, and the feasting and merriment
were resumed.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jellia Jamb exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There is nothing more to eat! The Hungry Tiger has consumed
everything!"</p>

<p>"But that is not the worst of it," declared the Tiger,
mournfully. "Somewhere or somehow, I've actually lost my
appetite!"</p>

<h2>21. Dorothy's Magic Belt</h2>

<p>Dorothy passed several very happy weeks in the Land of Oz as the
guest of the royal Ozma, who delighted to please and interest the
little Kansas girl. Many new acquaintances were formed and many old
ones renewed, and wherever she went Dorothy found herself among
friends.</p>

<p>One day, however, as she sat in Ozma's private room, she noticed
hanging upon the wall a picture which constantly changed in
appearance, at one time showing a meadow and at another time a
forest, a lake or a village.</p>

<p>"How curious!" she exclaimed, after watching the shifting scenes
for a few moments.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ozma, "that is really a wonderful invention in
magic. If I wish to see any part of the world or any person living,
I need only express the wish and it is shown in the picture."</p>

<p>"May I use it?" asked Dorothy, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Of course, my dear."</p>

<p>"Then I'd like to see the old Kansas farm, and Aunt Em," said
the girl.</p>

<p>Instantly the well remembered farmhouse appeared in the picture,
and Aunt Em could be seen quite plainly. She was engaged in washing
dishes by the kitchen window and seemed quite well and contented.
The hired men and the teams were in the harvest fields behind the
house, and the corn and wheat seemed to the child to be in prime
condition. On the side porch Dorothy's pet dog, Toto, was lying
fast asleep in the sun, and to her surprise old Speckles was
running around with a brood of twelve new chickens trailing after
her.</p>

<p>"Everything seems all right at home," said Dorothy, with a sigh
of relief. "Now I wonder what Uncle Henry is doing."</p>

<p>The scene in the picture at once shifted to Australia, where, in
a pleasant room in Sydney, Uncle Henry was seated in an easy chair,
solemnly smoking his briar pipe. He looked sad and lonely, and his
hair was now quite white and his hands and face thin and
wasted.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Dorothy, in an anxious voice, "I'm sure Uncle Henry
isn't getting any better, and it's because he is worried about me.
Ozma, dear, I must go to him at once!"</p>

<p>"How can you?" asked Ozma.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Dorothy; "but let us go to Glinda the
Good. I'm sure she will help me, and advise me how to get to Uncle
Henry."</p>

<p>Ozma readily agreed to this plan and caused the Sawhorse to be
harnessed to a pretty green and pink phaeton, and the two girls
rode away to visit the famous sorceress.</p>

<p>Glinda received them graciously, and listened to Dorothy's story
with attention.</p>

<p>"I have the magic belt, you know," said the little girl. "If I
buckled it around my waist and commanded it to take me to Uncle
Henry, wouldn't it do it?"</p>

<p>"I think so," replied Glinda, with a smile.</p>

<p>"And then," continued Dorothy, "if I ever wanted to come back
here again, the belt would bring me."</p>

<p>"In that you are wrong," said the sorceress. "The belt has
magical powers only while it is in some fairy country, such as the
Land of Oz, or the Land of Ev. Indeed, my little friend, were you
to wear it and wish yourself in Australia, with your uncle, the
wish would doubtless be fulfilled, because it was made in
fairyland. But you would not find the magic belt around you when
you arrived at your destination."</p>

<p>"What would become of it?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"It would be lost, as were your silver shoes when you visited Oz
before, and no one would ever see it again. It seems too bad to
destroy the use of the magic belt in that way, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Then," said Dorothy, after a moment's thought, "I will give the
magic belt to Ozma, for she can use it in her own country. And she
can wish me transported to Uncle Henry without losing the
belt."</p>

<p>"That is a wise plan," replied Glinda.</p>

<p>So they rode back to the Emerald City, and on the way it was
arranged that every Saturday morning Ozma would look at Dorothy in
her magic picture, wherever the little girl might chance to be.
And, if she saw Dorothy make a certain signal, then Ozma would know
that the little Kansas girl wanted to revisit the Land of Oz, and
by means of the Nome King's magic belt would wish that she might
instantly return.</p>

<p>This having been agreed upon, Dorothy bade good-bye to all her
friends. Tiktok wanted to go to Australia; too, but Dorothy knew
that the machine man would never do for a servant in a civilized
country, and the chances were that his machinery wouldn't work at
all. So she left him in Ozma's care.</p>

<p>Billina, on the contrary, preferred the Land of Oz to any other
country, and refused to accompany Dorothy.</p>

<p>"The bugs and ants that I find here are the finest flavored in
the world," declared the yellow hen, "and there are plenty of them.
So here I shall end my days; and I must say, Dorothy, my dear, that
you are very foolish to go back into that stupid, humdrum world
again."</p>

<p>"Uncle Henry needs me," said Dorothy, simply; and every one
except Billina thought it was right that she should go.</p>

<p>All Dorothy's friends of the Land of Oz&mdash;both old and
new&mdash;gathered in a group in front of the palace to bid her a
sorrowful good-bye and to wish her long life and happiness. After
much hand shaking, Dorothy kissed Ozma once more, and then handed
her the Nome King's magic belt, saying:</p>

<p>"Now, dear Princess, when I wave my handkerchief, please wish me
with Uncle Henry. I'm aw'fly sorry to leave you&mdash;and the
Scarecrow&mdash;and the Tin Woodman&mdash;and the Cowardly
Lion&mdash;and Tiktok&mdash;and&mdash;and everybody&mdash;but I do
want my Uncle Henry! So good-bye, all of you."</p>

<p>Then the little girl stood on one of the big emeralds which
decorated the courtyard, and after looking once again at each of
her friends, waved her handkerchief.</p>

<hr>

<p>"No," said Dorothy, "I wasn't drowned at all. And I've come to
nurse you and take care of you, Uncle Henry, and you must promise
to get well as soon as poss'ble."</p>

<p>Uncle Henry smiled and cuddled his little niece close in his
lap.</p>

<p>"I'm better already, my darling," said he.</p>
