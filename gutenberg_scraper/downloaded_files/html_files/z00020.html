<h1>The Ancient Highway<br>
A Novel of High Hearts and Open Woods</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h1>James Oliver Curwood</h1>

<hr align="center" width="50%">

<p style="text-align:center"><i>To the Memory of</i><br>
SIR WILLIAM PRICE</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">

<p>For the friendship, encouragement and active assistance of Sir
William Price, of Kenagami, on the Saguenay, I feel myself deeply
indebted. His tragic death seems an interwoven part of this book,
for the very drama of the novel itself, as talked over and
discussed with him, shaped itself with shocking suddenness in his
own life. Sir William, with his great paper and pulp mills and his
five thousand square miles of Quebec forests, was the heart and
soul of the forest industry in the vast wooded Province which has
grieved so deeply for him. His beautiful character, his love for
the out-of-doors, his deep and sincere sympathy made him not only
Canada's greatest conservationist but also her most loved citizen.
Sir William was a man of the forests, and sent no man where he
would not go himself. As this story was written, its typed pages
went into his hands, and shortly after its last chapters were
finished came the tragic day on the pitiless and mighty Saguenay,
when Sir William, personally investigating a danger which was
menacing some of his workmen, was caught in the avalanche which
carried him to his death in the fury of the waters along which he
had spent so much of his life. In that hour Canada suffered a loss
of one who cannot be replaced. It is a satisfaction to me, mellowed
by the grief of his loss, that Sir William played an important part
in the writing of this novel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>Clifton Brant believed himself to be only one of innumerable
flying grains of human dust in a world gone mad. And among these
grains he knew himself to be a misfit. For which reason he was
walking the wide highway from Brantford Town in Ontario to the
ancient city of Quebec on the St. Lawrence, an unimportant matter
of seven hundred miles or so, not counting the distance he would
travel in crossing and recrossing the road on the way.</p>

<p>In the scale with which he was measuring life at the present
moment time had no specific value for him, just as his objective
was neither far nor near. People passed him, smothering him in the
dust of their thirty and forty and fifty miles an hour, and
wondered who he was. There was something picturesque about him, and
worth remembering. He was, without shouting or advertising the
fact, an adventurer. People sensed that quality about him after
they had left him behind in a cloud of dirt. He caught their
attention even as they bore down upon him&mdash;his lithe,
khaki-clad form, the clean, free swing of his shoulders which bore
a worn knapsack, his easy stride, as if he had walked from the
beginning of the world&mdash;and then, as they passed him, the
quick, flashing gray of his eyes, the debonair wave of his hand, a
smile, a nod&mdash;and someone would ask, "Who do you think that
man could be?"</p>

<p>"Out of a job and hoofing it to the next town," one would
submit.</p>

<p>"An ex-soldier, by his walk," another would suggest.</p>

<p>"Or one of those walking idiots out on a week's
vacation"&mdash;this from a man who curled up and snapped whenever
his wife asked a question about another man.</p>

<p>And behind them, spitting out their dust, Clifton Brant wondered
what life could hold for people who went through it always on four
wheels questing out its beauties at a-mile-a-minute speed.</p>

<p>The golden sun was hanging low behind the spires and maple-clad
hills of Brantford Town when he swung from the main highway into a
road that angled southward. It was a modest and inconspicuous
little road, slanting downward as it ran, carpeted with soft dust
and winding between cool and shadowy thickets of bushes and trees
in which the birds were beginning their evening song.</p>

<p>A thickening came into Clifton's throat and his heart beat a
little faster as he looked ahead of him, for it was more than
twenty years ago that his feet had last traveled this way. He was
sixteen then, and barefooted. And time had been kind to the little
road, he thought. The velvety dust was the same, and he caught
himself looking for the imprints of his naked feet as he waded
through it; and the trees were the same, seeming not to have grown
in those twenty years, and the thickets of his boyhood sprang up
one by one, with the big rocks between&mdash;only the rocks seemed
smaller now than when he was a boy, and the hollows seemed a bit
less steep, and the Big Woods, still uncut, held less of their old
mystery and fearsomeness in the shadowing depths of sunset. A smile
crept gently over his face, and in that smile were the pathos and
joyous grief of reminiscence, of precious memories rising in his
path and of faded years stirring with life again.</p>

<p>Verging on forty, he felt his boyhood was only yesterday. He was
foolish, he told himself, to allow things to come back to him so
vividly. And he had been unwise to return at all to this little
road and its hallowed past. He had not thought it would hurt quite
so much, or that such a vast and encompassing loneliness would
descend upon him.</p>

<p>Almost as if a danger might lie in his path he paused
hesitatingly at the top of a little hill which in childhood had
been a big hill to him, and made his way through a fringe of thick
brush and over a rail fence. The birds twittered about him. A
yellow-breasted chat scolded him and a kingbird sent up a warning
cry or two. Then he heard the twitter of swallows and caught the
shiny flash of their wings over the clearing which lay just beyond
the fence. A lump rose in his throat. It was as if the same
swallows he had known and envied and loved as a boy were there
still, dipping and shooting and sweeping the air as they cast about
for their suppers among the insects that rose up from the earth at
sunset. And there, just a little way ahead, was what he had once
called <i>home</i>.</p>

<p>He was not ashamed of tears, in spite of the fact that he had
passed through searing fires and had seen much that is hard for a
man to look upon. He could not keep them back from his eyes and he
did not try to wipe them away.</p>

<p>The old home was a ruin. Fire had gutted it and its walls of
flat stones picked up from slate and sandstone ledges had fallen
in. One end wall stood triumphant above the desolation, and this
was the end which held the big fireplace chimney. He was born on a
cold winter night when a fire had roared in that chimney. And
before it he had dreamed his first dreams of conquest and adventure
in the wonderful world which reached for such illimitable distances
about him.</p>

<p>He went nearer and walked slowly about this ghost of a
habitation which had once been home. He was surprised at its
smallness. He had always carried with him the impression that this
first and only home of his had been little less than a castle, at
least three times as large as it now appeared to be. He chuckled,
though he did not feel happy. Childhood memories were funny things.
They were best left alone if one did not want to feel real grief.
And what had been the inside of the house was pathetically small,
now that he measured it with the eyes of a man.</p>

<p>The whole was overgrown with creeping vines and bushes. There
were blackberry and dewberry vines with green fruit; bitter-sweet
had tangled itself among the stones; wild cucumbers festooned one
side of the chimney, and long grass had grown up quickly to cover
the scars of dissolution. And other life was there. A pair of
thrushes hopped about unafraid of him. A golden humming-bird
flashed in and dipped at the honey-sweet hearts of red clover
blooms. A yellow warbler dared to sing and the swallows were using
the old chimney for a home.</p>

<p>Over near the fence he heard a red squirrel chatter, and the
sound drew his eyes. There had always been a red squirrel in the
old hollow oak near the fence, usually a family of them. The oak
had changed amazingly, Clifton thought. He had remembered it as the
biggest tree that had ever painted a picture of itself in his
brain; now it was a most ordinary oak, not nearly as large as some
he had seen up the road. His father had made him a swing in that
tree, and his mother had played with him a thousand times in its
shade.</p>

<p>His eyes turned from the tree, and suddenly his heart gave a
queer jump.</p>

<p>For a moment his sensation was almost one of shock. Half a
stone's throw away was a huge boulder from under which had always
bubbled the icy water of a spring. Near this spring, looking at
him, stood a boy&mdash;a boy and a dog. And this boy, as Clifton
remembered himself, was the boy who had played about and drunk at
that same spring a quarter of a century ago.</p>

<p>He was a pale, slim, rather pathetic-looking object who seemed
to have grown mostly to legs. He had on the same old hat, too, a
straw hat with a ragged brim and a broken crown; and his knee pants
were too short, as Clifton's had always been, and were of the blue
overall stuff which he could remember as clearly as he remembered
Bim, his dog, who was buried down at the edge of the woods. And it
seemed to Clifton the dog, as well as the boy, had come like an
apparition out of the past. For it was a "hound-dog," a mongrel,
just as loyal old Bim had been; a yellowish dog with loppy ears,
big joints and over-grown feet and a clublike tail in which every
joint was a knot.</p>

<p>Clifton saw all this as he drew nearer, smiling at them. The boy
did not move, but remained staring, holding tightly to a stick,
while the dog's big, lank body pressed closer to him, as if to
protect him. Then, at close range, Clifton observed other things.
The beast's ribs were as prominent as the knots in his tail, and in
his eyes and attitude was a hungry look. The boy, too, was thinner
than he should have been. His waist was ragged. The bottoms of his
pants were in frayed tatters. He had blue eyes, wide-open,
straight, strangely old but beautiful blue eyes, in a face which
was too white and which was troubled with the same hungry look that
was in the dog's.</p>

<p>"Hello, you and your dog," greeted Clifton, with a comradely
grin. "Is the water still running?"</p>

<p>"Sure," replied the boy. "It always runs. We keep it dug
out&mdash;me an' Bim."</p>

<p>"You and&mdash;<i>who</i>?"</p>

<p>"Bim. That's my dog, here."</p>

<p>Slowly Clifton took off his pack. "You and&mdash;<i>Bim</i>!" he
repeated. "And your name doesn't happen to be Cliff, does
it?&mdash;and your nickname Skinny?"</p>

<p>The boy eyed him wonderingly. "No. My name is Joe. What you
carrying in that bag?"</p>

<p>"And where did you find that name&mdash;<i>Bim</i>&mdash;for
your pup?" asked Clifton.</p>

<p>"Down there in a beech tree. It's cut deep in with a knife. An'
there's figgers, but they've faded out. That's a funny-lookin' bag
you got!"</p>

<p>Clifton turned away a moment. He could see the big beech tree
under whose sheltering arms he had dug Bim's grave, and where he
had worked the whole of one Sunday afternoon in carving his
comrade's epitaph. His mother had helped him, and had comforted him
when he cried. He was ten then, so it must have been twenty-eight
years ago.</p>

<p>"Dear God, but life is even less than a dream," he whispered to
himself.</p>

<p>The boy was inspecting his pack.</p>

<p>"What you got in this bag?" he demanded again. "It looks like a
sojer's bag."</p>

<p>"It is," said Clifton.</p>

<p>The boy's blue eyes widened.</p>

<p>"You a sojer?"</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"An' you&mdash;you've killed people?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so, Joe."</p>

<p>For several seconds the boy held his breath. Bim was cautiously
smelling the stranger, and Clifton laid a hand caressingly on his
head. "Hello, Bim, old comrade. Are you glad <i>I've come
back</i>?"</p>

<p>The mongrel licked his hand and wagged his knotty tail.</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;come back?" asked the boy. "You been
here before?"</p>

<p>"Sure," replied Clifton. "I used to live in that pile of stones
when I was a boy, Joe. It was a house then. I was born there. And I
had a dog named Bim. He died, and I buried him under the old beech
tree down there, and carved his name in the trunk. This isn't your
spring. It's <i>mine</i>!"</p>

<p>He tried to laugh as he knelt down to drink. But there was a
choking in his heart that seemed to have taken away his thirst.
When he got up the boy had tossed his old hat on the ground beside
the pack. He was tow-headed, with freckles in his pale skin.</p>

<p>"What you got in this here bag?" he asked again.</p>

<p>An inspiration came to Clifton.</p>

<p>"I've got&mdash;supper," he said. "Do you suppose your folks
will mind if you stay here and eat with me&mdash;you and Bim?"</p>

<p>A look of surprise, and then of pleasure, came into the boy's
face.</p>

<p>"We'll stay," he said.</p>

<p>"But your folks? I don't want to get you and Bim into trouble.
When I was a kid and wasn't home at supper time my father used to
go to those big lilac bushes you see out there, and break off a
switch&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I ain't got any folks," interrupted Joe hastily, as if to
settle any possible objection the stranger might have. "We'll like
as not get it anyway, if old Tooker is home, won't we,
Bim?"&mdash;turning to his dog.</p>

<p>Bim wagged his tail affirmatively, but his hungry eyes did not
leave the pack which the man was slowly opening.</p>

<p>"No folks?" queried Clifton softly. "Why not?"</p>

<p>"Dead, I guess. Old Tooker says I was wished on 'im. Mis' Tooker
ain't so bad, but she's bad enough. They both hate Bim. He never
goes home but just hangs around in the edge of the woods waiting
for me. I get him what I can to eat an' we hunt the rest. That's a
dandy kit, ain't it?"</p>

<p>Clifton was undoing his aluminum cooking outfit&mdash;a skillet,
coffee pail, plates, cups, knives and forks&mdash;and paused for a
moment with a brown parcel in his hand. Bim grew suddenly
stiff-legged and thrust out his long neck to get a sniff of it.</p>

<p>"Meat!" exclaimed the boy. "Bim knows it. He can smell meat a
mile away&mdash;meat an' chickens. Watch out or he'll lam it!"</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Grab it. He's quick on meat an' chickens, Bim is!"</p>

<p>Clifton drew out two big onions, a link of bologna, half a loaf
of bread made into buttered sandwiches, four oranges and a glass of
marmalade. This stock, with a pound and a half of fresh beef ground
into hamburger, he had planned as sufficient for both his supper
and breakfast. The bologna was an emergency asset.</p>

<p>He smiled up at Joe, whose eyes had grown larger and rounder
with each additional appearance of food. He had a hand gripped
firmly in the folds of loose hide on Bim's neck.</p>

<p>"Look out for your bolony!" he gasped. "Bim's awful quick!"</p>

<p>Clifton held out a pack-strap. "Better tie Bim up until we're
ready," he advised. "This bologna is especially for Bim, but we'll
make him wait and eat with us like a gentleman. Heigh-ho! Now for
some wood, Joe. We're going to have a great feast!"</p>

<p>He stood up, and for a moment watched Joe as he dragged the
reluctant Bim to a near-by tree. And in this moment he became
conscious of an amazing change in himself. The loneliness which had
oppressed him all that day of his "home-coming" was gone. Tragedy
and pain had crushed him a few minutes ago when he had looked upon
the crumbled and overgrown ruin of what had once been his home, the
shrine forever hallowed by the presence of mother, father, his
dog&mdash;and boyhood. In those minutes he had felt and seen only
the melancholy ghosts of dissolution and death, of broken dreams,
of grief and the emptiness of life.</p>

<p>Now in the strange and swift reaction which swept through him he
saw about him a sweet and wondrous beauty. There was no longer
gloom or a suffocating heaviness weighing down his heart. The
thrushes were singing their praise of the glorious sunset in the
western sky. In the oak tree the red squirrel and his mate were
scampering in play. Out of the woods came a low, familiar drone of
life; a catbird offered up its incomparable melody from a thicket
near the rail fence, and he sensed a new joyousness of greeting in
the softer, lower twittering of the swallows skimming over his
head. His heart beat a little faster. He raised his head and drank
more deeply of the cool air of evening, and suddenly it came to him
that the great and glorious nature which was his god had made
itself a tenant here and lay like a benediction upon all that had
ever been.</p>

<p>And then the truth pressed upon him as his eyes went back to the
boy and the dog.</p>

<p><i>They had made this change for him!</i>
</p>

<p>He began to whistle as he gathered dry sticks of wood. The boy
ran back and helped, his eyes shining and his voice a-tremble with
the thrill of his wonderful adventure, while Bim settled back on
his haunches after one mournful howl and waited like a stoic.</p>

<p>A thin white spiral of smoke rose in the sunset.</p>

<p>And in their new comradeship the boy became the inquisitor.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Clifton Brant. You may call me Uncle Cliff."</p>

<p>"You got a dog?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You took my old Bim's name so I'm half owner in
<i>your</i> Bim."</p>

<p>They peeled and cut up the onions. Water simmered in the coffee
pail. The skillet grew hot and thick patties of hamburger sizzled
as they were dropped into it.</p>

<p>"You got any folks here?"</p>

<p>"I'm like you, Joe. I haven't any folks anywhere."</p>

<p>"Whadda you do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I just sort of wander round. I'm what they call a&mdash;an
adventurer."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Can you read, Joe?"</p>

<p>"I'm in the sixth grade. They make old Tooker send me to
school."</p>

<p>"Ever read a pirate story?"</p>

<p>"You bet!"</p>

<p>"Well, a pirate is an adventurer."</p>

<p>The boy gave a sudden gasp.</p>

<p>"<i>Gee whiz</i>, are you a pirate?"</p>

<p>"A&mdash;sort of one," laughed Clifton.</p>

<p>"An' you kill people?"</p>

<p>"All adventurers don't kill people, Joe. Some of them just
<i>pretty near</i> kill people, and then let them go."</p>

<p>The boy did not know the meaning of the steely flash which came
for a moment into Clifton's eyes.</p>

<p>"You goin' to stay here?" he whispered worshipfully.</p>

<p>"No. I'm going on tomorrow."</p>

<p>A blue jay screamed in the oak. Bim howled again. For a space
the boy no longer smelled the delicious aroma of frying hamburger
and onions.</p>

<p>"Why don't you stay?" he asked. "What you goin' on for?"</p>

<p>Clifton laughed. He leaned over and took the boy's thin face
between his two hands. Even with the laugh the steely glitter was
not yet gone out of his eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm on my way to collect a debt of a million dollars, Joe," he
said. "I've been on my way for a long time, and now I'm almost
there. That's why I can't stay. Understand?"</p>

<p>The boy nodded. "I guess so," he said. "Can I bring Bim
now?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>West of Brantford Town the sun sank behind maple hills as they
ate.</p>

<p>Clifton was hungry, but he held his appetite in leash as he
watched the boy and the dog, yet appeared not to notice them at
all. For the boy's hunger was a thing that made him think of
starvation, and Bim swallowed chunks of bologna with gulping sounds
that emanated from the very depths of his being. Quite frankly Joe
confided that he tried to smuggle to Bim a part of the food which
was given him each day at old Tooker's.</p>

<p>"When we have milk an' boiled meal Bim goes pretty hungry
because I can't sneak that in my pockets," he added.</p>

<p>"Who is Tooker, and what does he do?"</p>

<p>"He's just Tooker, an' I never see him do much of anything.
Riley's boy told me once that his dad said Tooker peddled likker to
the Indians on the reservation. When I asked Tooker if he did he
whaled the life out of me an' told me if I didn't lick Riley's kid
the next time I saw him he'd whale me ag'in. I tried it, but I
couldn't lick Slippy Riley. He licked me. An' then old Tooker
whaled me until Bim run in from the woods an' took a chunk out of
his leg. Looky here&mdash;"</p>

<p>He bent over and pulled up his ragged waist. His thin white back
was streaked with the scars of a lash.</p>

<p>"He did that day before yesterday because Bim and me come on him
way down in the swampiest part of Bumble's Holler cooking something
in a queer-lookin' kettle over a fire."</p>

<p>"The devil!" said Clifton.</p>

<p>He changed the subject, and after a little the boy leaned back
with a deep sigh, his hands on his stomach.</p>

<p>"I'm full," he said. "An' I guess Bim is, too. Want me to wash
the dishes?"</p>

<p>They leaned together over the little pool and scrubbed the
dishes with white sand, then dried them in the air. The last red
glow of sunset was fading away when they climbed the rail fence and
struck the soft white dust of the road.</p>

<p>The boy's face was filled with a grave anxiety as they walked
down the road side by side.</p>

<p>"Where you goin' tonight?" he asked.</p>

<p>"As far as the little church and the cemetery."</p>

<p>"The old Indian church?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'm goin' that far. Tooker's is the second house beyond."</p>

<p>He waited a moment, and his hand touched Clifton's arm
timidly.</p>

<p>"You got anybody there&mdash;dead ones, I mean?"</p>

<p>"My mother, Joe."</p>

<p>"You ain't an Indian?"</p>

<p>"A part of me. My mother's grandmother was a Mohawk princess.
She is buried there, too."</p>

<p>A silence fell upon them. The boy's bare feet made soft little
pattering sounds in the thick dust, and behind them came Bim, so
that looking back Clifton saw a trail which was very much like his
own of many years ago. Twilight was falling and shadows were
growing deeper in the thickets, and pale gloom descended like a
veil upon the land about them. In the grass at the roadsides
crickets chirped, and ahead and behind them tree-toads called their
half-hearted promises of rain.</p>

<p>It was that part of evening which Clifton loved, yet in its
stillness and peace was an unspeakable loneliness for him, and this
loneliness seemed to fall upon the boy. A small hand gripped his
sleeve and Clifton's fingers closed about it. For a little while
longer they did not speak. A pair of night-hawks gave their musical
calls over their heads, and from a long distance came the soft
tolling of a bell. Then a rabbit scurried down the road like a
torpedo shooting through the dust, and with a sudden wail Bim took
after it.</p>

<p>The boy's fingers tightened. Ahead of them a darker glow grew in
the twilight where the patch of maples and evergreens marked the
churchyard.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you're goin' on tomorrow," said Joe, and his voice
seemed very faint and tired. "I wish we was goin' with
you&mdash;Bim and me."</p>

<p>"I wish you were," said Clifton.</p>

<p>They came to the high bank where the church stood and the
evergreens grew. And here, at the beginning of the worn foot-path
which led up to the picket fence and the old-fashioned gate,
Clifton stopped.</p>

<p>"You ain't goin' to stop here&mdash;<i>now</i>?" whispered Joe,
with eyes that grew big in the dusk. "It's dark!"</p>

<p>"Adventurers aren't afraid of the dark," Clifton laughed softly,
"or of graves. I'm going to sleep in the churchyard tonight.
They're beautiful, Joe&mdash;churchyards, I mean. Everybody's your
friend, there."</p>

<p>"<i>Ugh!</i>" shuddered the boy. "Bim&mdash;Bim&mdash;where you
goin'?" The dog had moved away, but came back and snuggled close to
his master's legs.</p>

<p>"You'd better run along now," urged Clifton. "I'll stand here
until you are well down the road. Maybe&mdash;in the
morning&mdash;I'll happen to see you again. Good night!"</p>

<p>"Good night!"</p>

<p>The boy drew away, and as he went it seemed to Clifton that
something dragged itself out of him to accompany this ragged and
barefoot youngster of the highway. Half a dozen times before he
disappeared in the gloom Joe turned and looked back, and when at
last the twilight swallowed him, with Bim trailing at his heels,
Clifton went slowly up the little path and passed through the open
gate.</p>

<p>He wondered, as he paused inside the gate, what the world would
think of him if it could know what he was doing tonight. Would it
call him a little mad? Or would it put him down as a sentimental
fool in a day and age which had lost its sentiment? For surely it
would not understand a man in his normal senses coming to sleep
among the dead.</p>

<p>It still lacked a few minutes of darkness and he could make out
the little cemetery quite clearly, with its crumbling gray
headstones and the old board church. He knew there was no change,
for this place never changed. It had not changed in nearly two
hundred years. He went to the front of the church and looked up.
There, indistinct in the dusk, was the time-worn tablet whose words
he had learned by heart in boyhood, telling the occasional
passer-by that this was the first church built in Ontario, and that
it was erected by His Gracious Majesty King George the Third for
his "children," the people of the Iroquois nation. It was Indian
then. It was Indian now. In the plot of ground about him slept the
dust of hundreds.</p>

<p>He took off his knapsack and hung it on the end of a box-like
rack at the corner of the church. In the rack was a cracked bronze
bell, and on the bell was the same ancient date as above. He had
often played on it with sticks when a boy. Now he tapped it with
his knuckles and found its melody still there.</p>

<p>He sat down and waited for the moon.</p>

<p>And now, it seemed to him, his mother came in the softness of
the evening and sat beside him near the old bell.</p>

<p>The moon came up. It rose in the clear, where the trees thinned
out. In their play his mother and he had had a lot of fun with the
moon. It had been very much alive for them, and when dressed up in
its various poses and humors they had given it different names.
Sometimes it was a very gentlemanly old moon, with a stiff collar
and a tilted chin; at others it was a Man out for Fun, with a
cock-sure look in his eye. But best of all they had loved their Man
in the Moon when he had the mumps. And it was the Mumpy Moon that
came up tonight, with a head askew and one cheek swollen, as if he
had been trampled under a cart and horse. But always, when the Man
in the Moon had the mumps, he also had a jolly smile in his broad,
fat face and a merry twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>"And when you are sick or things are going wrong you must always
remember the Man in the Moon when he has the mumps," the mother had
impressed upon Clifton. "It is then, when he is feeling very badly,
that he laughs at us and winks. That is what the brave old moon
does, and all brave men do the same."</p>

<p>Clifton remembered. He remembered so vividly that a strange
thrill ran through him as he stood up to watch the transformation
which the moon was making in the darkness and shadows about him.
Objects began to take form and the trees grew out of night. Light
played on the old bell and crept warmly over the church. It fell on
the iron grating and stone tomb of Thayendanegea&mdash;of Joseph
Brant, the Mohawk, greatest of the Iroquois. He saw the earth
slowly taking new form on all sides of him, rising in little mounds
that were marked with old and crumbling stones. And there were
mounds and little hollows from which even the dust of stone had
been eaten away by the centuries. Here were drama, romance,
adventure and unspeakable tragedy&mdash;here where the last and the
greatest of the chivalry of the Six Nations lay buried in a refuge
given them by an English king when their blood-soaked empire was
lost south of the friendly Canadas.</p>

<p>And they were his mother's people, and <i>his</i> people. He had
always been proud of that. And the memory which came back to him so
vividly now was of another night when his mother and he had watched
the moon light up this acre of silence just as it was doing now.
Their dead was what they had called these sleeping ones. His mother
had known their tragic history and the stories and legends that
reached back a hundred years beyond that; and she had told him they
were so many here they slept one above another, and sometimes in
twos and threes and with arms and shoulders
touching&mdash;forgotten and nameless ones, buried even before King
George built his church or ever a white man had come this way.</p>

<p>He passed out among them, and over him came a strange sense of
restfulness and peace, as if he had reached home after a long and
arduous struggle. He did not feel again the thickening in his
throat or the tightening at his heart when he stood at last beside
the spot where his mother lay. That had passed, and his emotion was
one of gladness and a sort of exultation. It had taken him many
years to achieve this moment, and he was amazed at the tranquillity
which became almost instantly a part of it.</p>

<p>In a little while he spread out his blanket and sat down and
then he lighted his pipe and began to smoke. The incongruity of it
all did not strike him. He had sat and slept with the dead when
they were above the ground and it did not embarrass him to be with
them when they were a part of it. The thought that remained with
him was that he had been traveling in a circle for twenty-two years
and had at last come back to the starting point.</p>

<p>He was rather disturbed by the fact that he soon surrendered to
the desire to stretch himself flat on his back with his pneumatic
pillow under his head. It was his quixotic notion that the act was
a selfish one. But he was tired, and the carpet of cedar needles
under his blanket was soft to lie upon. Occasionally he closed his
eyes as he looked up at the sky. The stars made him think of the
tree-toads and the falseness of their prophecy. And he wondered if
Joe had another whipping to his credit, and if old man Tooker was
down in Bumble's Hollow cooking something in a queer-looking kettle
over a fire.</p>

<p>Tomorrow he might look into it, for he knew that very spot where
Tooker would undoubtedly hide.</p>

<p>Then, he planned sleepily, he would go on and collect his
million dollars.</p>

<p>He smiled, and his eyes grew heavier. On that adventure the
spirit of Molly Brant would go with him. For this she had waited,
as he had waited, and they would collect the debt together.</p>

<p>And when it was over&mdash;</p>

<p>The wise-eyed old owl in the thick evergreen tops above him knew
when he slept. The bird hooted softly and drifted out into the
moonlight and away to its open hunting-fields. The night grew
cooler and the aroma of the earth lay heavier as the hours passed.
Overhead the moon climbed higher and began its descent into the
west. The owl returned and croaked from the belfry tower. Darkness
followed moonlight as the crickets and katydids hushed their cries,
and out of the east crept dawn.</p>

<p>In that dawn Clifton dreamed. He stood with his mother in the
cemetery, and he was a boy again. And Molly Brant was as he had so
often seen her at his father's side, with her dark eyes afire with
love and laughter and her long hair in a girlish braid down her
back. They were alone, hand in hand, and suddenly all about them
the earth began giving up its dead.</p>

<p>Chieftains rose to salute them and warriors sprang up so swiftly
that very soon it was beyond his power to count them. They were in
war-paint and feathers and ready for battle, and behind them,
gathered in a great circle, were countless women and children. And
in his dream Clifton saw that his mother and he were the center of
this gathering host, and that his mother stood with her hand raised
above her head, as if she were princess of them all.</p>

<p>The chieftains advanced toward them one by one, and he knew them
as they came&mdash;first Red Jacket the eloquent young Seneca, with
his eternal plea for peace with the white men on his lips; then
Cornplanter, the terror of the Mohawk settlements, fierce and
implacable, and Peter Martin the Oneida, and after them&mdash;tall
and calm and splendid in his power&mdash;Joseph Brant, the Mohawk,
chief of all the Iroquois nation. And they bent their heads to his
mother!</p>

<p>And then Thayendanegea began to speak.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow you seek vengeance," he said. "It is well. The
Iroquois go with you!"</p>

<p>"You will find strife and death and unhappiness," interposed the
peaceful Seneca. "The hatchet is rusty. Let it remain so."</p>

<p>"Only cowards like the backsliding Oneidas fear those three
things," boomed the Mohawk in a voice that rolled like the deep
beating of a drum.</p>

<p>"The Senecas are not cowards&mdash;yet I fear."</p>

<p>"I am an Oneida&mdash;and I do not fear," said Peter Martin.</p>

<p>In his dream Clifton saw a sudden break in the circle of
warriors as an Indian girl ran through and knelt at the feet of his
mother. It seemed she had run fast or far, for she could scarcely
speak as she raised her bare arms. His mother bent down to her so
that she could hear her whispered words, and in those few moments
Clifton heard his own name spoken.</p>

<p>Then his mother stood erect, and faced the chiefs.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow we go," she said, and a murmur of approbation came
from all except the Seneca, who stooped sadly to gather up a
handful of earth and throw it westward over his shoulder.</p>

<p>A part of the earth struck Clifton in the face. It was soft and
warm. And in that moment he saw a strange and amazing
transformation in the girl kneeling at his mother's feet. She was
no longer Indian, but a white girl, and she was looking straight at
him with laughter on her lips and in her eyes. He felt himself grow
uncomfortable and tried to wipe the wet dirt from his face, but no
sooner did he remove it from one spot than it came back on another,
and the greater effort he made the more amused she seemed to
be.</p>

<p>In sudden rage he turned upon Red Jacket and found the Seneca
gone. The Indian host was melting away and the going of the last of
it was like the dissolution of shadow before swift dawn. He turned
again, and his mother had disappeared. Only the girl and he were
left, and it seemed to him this impertinent young person disfigured
her pretty nose in making faces at him as she faded away, like the
others, into nothingness.</p>

<p>A fresh bit of the warm, soft dirt struck Clifton on the cheek
and roused him to a comprehension of other phenomena. He found
himself suddenly lying flat on his back with his eyes wide open and
he could see tree tops with the filtering gold of sunlight in them.
A bird was singing.</p>

<p>Then appeared a grotesque head between him and the light above
and Bim's warm and friendly tongue caressed him again.</p>

<p>He sat up.</p>

<p>"The deuce take me if it wasn't a perfectly ripping dream," he
said; and then added, "Good morning, Bim!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>Clifton rose and stretched himself as Bim wagged his tail and
contorted his loosely jointed body in greeting. It was at least an
hour after his usual waking time. The sun was above the horizon,
the birds were wide awake, and he heard the rattle of wagon wheels
up the road and a distant voice calling cattle. He was pleased as
he laid a friendly hand on Bim's homely head and looked about him.
He could not remember a more restful night or a more interesting
one and he was filled with a deep appreciation of the
thoughtfulness which had inspired the dog's early visit. That was
the way with dogs. They never forgot a courtesy. And that was one
of the many reasons why he loved them more than all men and
respected them more than most.</p>

<p>Dreams were remarkable things, he told himself, as the sun began
finding its way in under the trees. For over there, as surely as he
lived, was the very spot where the Indian maiden who had turned
into a white girl had knelt at his mother's feet, and down that
path which led toward the gate she had backed away from him at
last, taunting him with her laughter. For a moment he almost
fancied he could see Red Jacket's footprints in the bare patch of
earth where he had stooped to fill his hand with dirt.</p>

<p>His vision went no farther. At the foot of the spruce tree his
eyes fell upon a huddled, crumpled figure which he instantly
recognized as Joe. The boy had fallen asleep with his back against
the tree and had drooped forward until his head rested between his
knees. His ragged hat had rolled away from him and his pale, thin
hands were filled with the brown needles as if he had clutched at
them in his last moment of wakefulness. There was something
pathetically and tragically forlorn about him&mdash;in the droop of
his slight shoulders, the raggedness of the wretched clothing that
covered him, the brown thinness of his legs, the way his thick
blond hair fell over his naked knees.</p>

<p>The smile that had been on Clifton's lips died away and the
humor in his eyes lost itself in a gathering cloud. He drew nearer
and looked down. On the back of the boy's bared neck was a black
and blue mark, and one of the sleeves of his waist was torn to the
shoulder. For half a minute Clifton made no effort to draw in a
deep breath.</p>

<p>Then he saw something else. A little behind the boy, partly
hidden by the tree, was a bundle. It was made up of burlaps tied
with binder-twine, and through this twine was thrust a stick.
Beside the bundle lay the oldest and queerest wreck of a gun that
Clifton had ever seen&mdash;and he had been through the war. It was
a muzzle-loading shotgun of ancient date. Its cracked stock was
bound with wire; its one-time hammer had been replaced by a "zulu"
slugger; its ramrod was a willow stick, and the sight-bead had been
knocked from its end. Clifton picked it up, and the instrument of
death wobbled loosely in his hands. Near the foot of the tree was a
four-ounce bottle partly filled with shot and another containing
powder.</p>

<p>The smile came back into Clifton's face.</p>

<p>Bim growled.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to steal it, you old fossil. Shut up!"</p>

<p>He replaced the gun on the ground as the boy slowly stirred
himself to wakefulness. A little at a time, Joe sat up. He opened
his eyes and blinked and rubbed them with the backs of two soiled
hands. In this first moment out of sleep his face appeared
strangely wan and frail. Life, it seemed, and not the joy of living
struggled back into him.</p>

<p>Then he saw Clifton standing over him.</p>

<p>He climbed to his feet and his face flashed suddenly with last
night's comradely smile.</p>

<p>"Good mornin'!"</p>

<p>"Good morning, Joe. When did you come?"</p>

<p>"I dunno. It wasn't light yet. Bim found where you was. We're
goin' with you!"</p>

<p>"You're&mdash;<i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"Goin' with you," repeated Joe confidently. "We told old Tooker
last night and he gave us a heck of a whalin', didn't 'e, Bim?"</p>

<p>"Pinched your neck, too, didn't he?"</p>

<p>Joe nodded. "We'd better hurry," he urged. "If Tooker ever found
us here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe that's him coming up the road," suggested Clifton. "Is
it?"</p>

<p>A stifled breath came from the boy, as if his heart had suddenly
skipped a beat or two. He looked from the road up at Clifton, and
in his blue eyes was a terror which made Clifton's fingers slowly
clench while the smile remained on his lips.</p>

<p>"That's him! It's Tooker! And he's after me!"</p>

<p>He made a grab for his gun, but Clifton's hand drew him
back.</p>

<p>"Wait here, Joe," he commanded. "Stand right out in the open so
that Tooker can't help seeing you."</p>

<p>"He sees us now!" gasped Joe. "He's coming toward the
gate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that's where I'm going to meet him&mdash;right at the
gate," reassured Clifton. "You stay here."</p>

<p>He measured his time and distance so that he had a moment in
which to observe Tooker as he covered the last few steps between
the road and the gate. He had seen ugly men but Tooker was one of
the ugliest that had ever confronted his eyes. In the first place
he was disgustingly dirty, even at a distance, and Clifton hated
dirty people. His repellent face bristled with a reddish stubble of
beard and one cheek was padded with an enormous quid of tobacco.
His big body was clumsy and slouching; his eyes had the mean
littleness of a pig's, and in one hand&mdash;as one might expect of
a creature of this kind&mdash;he carried a heavy stick, shiny from
use and quite suited to murderous assault in the dark.</p>

<p>Clifton was amazed. By what curious sociological argument had
the people of the district allowed a beast of this kind to hold an
abusive authority over a boy like Joe?</p>

<p>He had a way of smiling when he was ready to kill. He pulled a
lone cigar out of his pocket and offered it to the man.</p>

<p>"Tooker, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm Tooker." The man accepted the cigar, looked at it, and
flung it on the ground. "Who the devil are you, and what you doing
with that brat?"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, Mr. Tooker," soothed Clifton. "I'm merely a wandering
officer of the law on a hunt for moonshiners. Incidentally, my name
is Brant, and yesterday in Brantford Town I repurchased the old
Brant homestead, which includes in its domain a nice bit of swamp
known as Bumble's Hollow; and as I shall soon return to this place
to live I want my property to have a clean reputation. And if it
wasn't for Joe, my nephew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My nephew, Tooker. If it wasn't for him and the disgrace it
would be to the family I'd take you to jail this minute!"</p>

<p>Tobacco juice was leaking from Tooker's inanimate jaw.</p>

<p>"He's been squealin'&mdash;lying to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort. We just happened to meet. I was coming to
see you about him this morning. You see, I made myself his uncle
last night, and today I'm taking him on to Montreal&mdash;and
beyond."</p>

<p>He was no longer smiling, and as he advanced a step toward
Tooker the other backed away. Clifton had put a hand into a pocket,
and now&mdash;instead of something more dangerous&mdash;he drew out
a wallet.</p>

<p>"I'm going to give you two things," he said. "First, the
cleanest two hundred dollars you ever had in those unwashed hands
of yours, Tooker. Here it is. Ten twenties so new you could hear
them crackle if your ears were clean. That's for taking care of Joe
so well."</p>

<p>The money was in Tooker's hands. An understanding gleam shot
into his eyes as he pocketed it, and in the same moment he stooped
and picked up the discarded cigar.</p>

<p>"That's right. It's a good one," approved Clifton.</p>

<p>He had measured his man correctly. Tooker was a pinch-fist
skinflint, a coward, and quite easily subdued. He was, Clifton
thought, the kind of human reptile whose eyesight is keenest in the
dark.</p>

<p>"And the other thing I am going to give you is some advice, and
it isn't bad like your moonshine, Tooker," he continued. "I'm going
to leave my evidence with the authorities up at Brantford. I'll ask
them to have a little mercy on you this time, for Joe's
sake&mdash;and Bim's. My advice is to buy three or four cows with
the money you have. And now we must leave you. I think we shall be
back in about a year, and if you haven't acquired the habit of
washing yourself and living like an honest man by that
time&mdash;why, God help you, Tooker!"</p>

<p>And as Clifton returned to Joe and packed his blanket he sang
blithely,</p>

<blockquote>"At night I'd hear across the Bow the tom-tom<br>
and the wail begun,<br>
Which told Papoose had ceased to breathe,<br>
about the setting of the sun."</blockquote>

<p>The road claimed them again. This time the glory of the rising
sun was in their faces.</p>

<p>For a space after they had started, Joe did not speak. He
carried the burlap bundle over his shoulder and in his hand was the
wreck of a gun. In his eyes was a light which day or night had
never found there before.</p>

<p>When the curve in the road shut out the cemetery behind them, he
asked, in a voice filled with worshipful awe, "How did you know all
that?"</p>

<p>"All of what, Joe?"</p>

<p>"About old Tooker."</p>

<p>Clifton laughed. In his eyes, too, was a different look from
that which sunset had left in them.</p>

<p>"I guessed it, just plumb guessed it from what you told me about
Bumble's Hollow. Good Lord, I'm more likely to go to jail myself
than to send Tooker there!"</p>

<p>"For taking me?"</p>

<p>"No, not for that. Remember, I'm your uncle, Joe. Tooker will
stick to that story, for he wouldn't dare confess that he sold
you&mdash;and he thinks too much of the money I've given him to
tell the truth. You see, this uncle business saves you from being a
runaway and me from being a kidnaper&mdash;which means a man who
steals kids. I need a family, anyway. And now, by Jove, I've got
one in you and Bim! I feel quite important. Let's see what you have
in that bundle."</p>

<p>They stopped, and Joe untied his pack so that its contents lay
exposed at the side of the road. There was a small matter of
clothing, ragged and soiled, an old pair of shoes, half of an
automobile tube, a monkey-wrench, hammer and nails, and a stuffed
owl.</p>

<p>Clifton regarded Joe's possessions with serious eyes.</p>

<p>"What's the automobile tube for?"</p>

<p>"Sling-shots."</p>

<p>"And the monkey-wrench?"</p>

<p>"That&mdash;an' the hammer? Them's tools."</p>

<p>"And the owl?"</p>

<p>"That's for good luck. Carry an owl an' you can see in the
dark."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>Clifton looked about.</p>

<p>"We're going on a big adventure, Joe, and these things won't
help us. We must hide them somewhere. Behind that old log in the
fence corner, for instance."</p>

<p>Joe picked up his gun and held it so tightly that his small
hands grew bloodless.</p>

<p>"Not this!"</p>

<p>"No, you may take the gun."</p>

<p>They were soon traveling eastward again.</p>

<p>"You see, Joe, you are no longer a boy," Clifton explained.
"You're a man. You're an adventurer yourself now, and we must
outfit you like one. Does that gun work?"</p>

<p>"You mean does it shoot?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It does&mdash;sometimes. It's kinda slow-going, though. An' it
blows powder in your face, but I don't mind that. She's good an'
stout, with all this wire. Want to shoot it?"</p>

<p>"Not just now."</p>

<p>Straight to town Clifton led the way. In a restaurant reeking
with the aromas of coffee and pork chops and fried potatoes they
had breakfast, and Bim ate his fill of scraps in the kitchen. Then
Joe was fitted out in a khaki suit, walking shoes, a Boy Scout hat
and knapsack, handkerchiefs, shirts and a necktie. After that
Clifton wrote a letter to Tooker, and when it was finished and
mailed he hunted up a certain old minister in the town and sat with
him in private conference for an hour. When he left he knew more
about twelve-year-old Joseph Hood than Joe knew about himself.</p>

<p>Once more on their way they passed the little road which led
down to the Indian church and settlement. Joe eyed it a bit
wistfully.</p>

<p>"Was that a fib, too&mdash;about you buying Bumble's Holler?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"No, that was the truth," said Clifton. "It's ours, Joe, every
last leg of its eighty acres&mdash;the spring, the old house, the
woods, everything. Some day we're coming back and will build
another house near the old one."</p>

<p>"An' we'll leave the old chimney for the swallows."</p>

<p>"Every stone of it."</p>

<p>During this first day Joe proved himself a veteran at walking.
And it seemed to him a thousand automobiles whizzed past them every
hour. More frequently than before Clifton was offered the courtesy
of rides, for the tall man, the slight boy and the gaunt dog
traveling side by side were an unusual combination on the
highway.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon, with the city of Hamilton half a
dozen miles away, when a swiftly moving and luxurious sedan came up
behind them. As it passed a man in the rear seat gave a sudden
exclamation and turned to look behind. A cloud of dust shut out his
vision, and with a word of apology he turned to the other occupants
of the car.</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for the absurdity of the thing I would say I know
that man," he said. "His resemblance to a remarkable person I once
knew is almost shocking!"</p>

<p>"He had a pleasant face, and smiled at us as we passed. Why
should the resemblance be shocking?" asked a girl who sat beside
him.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;under other circumstances I would swear that I
saw him for the last time two years ago on the Yangtze Kiang, where
he was in charge of the Chinese government's reforestation project.
He had twenty-five million trees to plant. Six months later he was
killed by natives north of Haipoong, in Indo-China. I feel as if I
had looked upon a dead man, and one for whom I held a strange
affection."</p>

<p>"Please stop the car!" commanded the girl.</p>

<p>The gentleman's bronzed face flushed slightly.</p>

<p>"Don't!" he entreated. "It is highly absurd. The man I am
thinking of was a Princess Pat, and we came out of Belgium
together. We were both laughing maniacs, and after the war he took
to wandering. I heard from him occasionally. He said something or
other was shot out of him&mdash;he couldn't just understand
what&mdash;and that it was impossible for him to settle down to his
old profession of forestry. He called himself an
intermigrant&mdash;wanted to be constantly on the move. I called
him the Walking Man. But he is dead now, shot up everlastingly
north of Haipoong, the records have it. He gave a queer reason for
not coming home."</p>

<p>The car had stopped. Behind it a cloud of dust drifted away with
the wind.</p>

<p>"What was his reason?" the girl asked.</p>

<p>"He was afraid he would kill a certain man if he returned."</p>

<p>"They have left the road and are crossing a field."</p>

<p>"Of course," nodded the prematurely old man at her side.
"Undoubtedly a farmer and his boy. Let us go on. And please pardon
me for bringing about an interruption of this kind."</p>

<p>And the car continued on its way.</p>

<p>"Do farmers have such nice eyes?" asked the girl. And then:
"What was the other man's name, Colonel Denis?"</p>

<p>"Brant&mdash;Clifton Brant," replied the Colonel. "He was
somewhere in the woods of upper Quebec when the war broke out. He
had made quite an unusual reputation as a forester, and was slated
for an important post with the government at that time. I think his
father had concessions there."</p>

<p>The girl was silent for a moment. Then in a low voice she said
for the Colonel alone: "That terrible war seems to have happened
only yesterday, yet it was ten years ago. I was a little girl then,
and I kissed the men as they marched away."</p>

<p>"Yes, only yesterday," he nodded, "and with some of us it will
always remain that near."</p>

<p>Clifton was following a creek into the green seclusion of a
rolling wood-lot. Out of sight of the road he found a pool from
which the water ran in a series of ripples that made a cooling,
musical sound.</p>

<p>"Supper&mdash;and a bath," he announced. "The bath first, Joe.
Strip&mdash;while I get out soap and towels. And scrub Bim while
you're in. He's almost as dirty as old Tooker."</p>

<p>He stood guard while Joe spent twenty minutes in the water, then
Joe took his turn, and fresh and cool from their purgation of dust
and grime they began the preparation of supper. Tonight it was
beefsteak, milk-fed and two years old the butcher had said, and
when it was over Clifton leaned in contentment with his back
against a tree. He noticed, too, that this one day had seemed to
take much of the thinness and whiteness from the boy's face, and
the restless and hunted look from his eyes.</p>

<p>"A fine place to sleep," he observed. "There is nothing like the
open air to produce health, wealth and wisdom, Joe. Always remember
that, and live up to it. If you do, and cultivate a sense of humor
at the same time, you are sure to die happy. But you must see the
funny things. If you don't you're a goner. God had to have His
jokes when He was making the world. He intended there should be a
lot of laughter, so you want to laugh. Why, <i>you're</i> funny,
Joe&mdash;so is Bim, and so am I, and so is everybody else."</p>

<p>Joe sat cross-legged, with Bim squatted at his side, and both
regarded Clifton with eager eyes. They were splendid listeners, and
Clifton chuckled his appreciation as he lighted his pipe and held
out at arm's length a newspaper which he had purchased in the last
town.</p>

<p>"Here it is&mdash;the humor of life right on the front page," he
went on, enjoying his monologue. "Picture of a girl with a
million-dollar pair of legs! They're the funniest of all,
Joe&mdash;women, I mean. They're shockingly funny&mdash;all except
our mothers. You must remember that mothers are never
funny&mdash;our own, I mean, though the other fellow's mother may
be deucedly funny. If <i>ours</i> bobs her hair it is all right;
she is beautiful still. If <i>our</i> mother wants to carry about
some kind of metal in the lobes of her ears it is perfectly proper
for her to do it, for you mustn't see anything that isn't nice and
beautiful about <i>her</i>. Now over on the next page&mdash;here we
have it again!&mdash;something to laugh at if it doesn't bring on
nausea first&mdash;a bobbed-haired Venus who is the millionth 'most
beautiful girl in America.'"</p>

<p>"What's a Venus," interrupted Joe.</p>

<p>"A Venus is a woman."</p>

<p>"With short hair?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. She may have either short or long hair. But if
she's a Venus with bobbed hair run for your life, particularly when
you get a little older. Why, Joe, if there was only one woman on
earth and she had bobbed hair I wouldn't marry her! I wouldn't
marry her anyway, but the bobbed hair would make a certainty of it
in case I got sick and weakened."</p>

<p>"It must be awful," suggested Joe.</p>

<p>"It is. Bobbed hair and million-dollar legs&mdash;they go
together. Now&mdash;going back to the front page&mdash;"</p>

<p>As Joe waited he saw a strange change in the man. The lines in
Clifton's face suddenly tightened and a staring directness took the
place of the humor in his eyes. His body stiffened. He forgot Joe
and Bim and slowly crumpled the paper until it was a mass in his
hands. He rose to his feet and Joe got up with him, a little
frightened.</p>

<p>Then Clifton took notice of the boy again, but this time the
smile which came to his lips was a hard and terrible one which Joe
had not seen before.</p>

<p>"And sometimes there are things which are not so funny," he
said, as much to himself as to Joe. "For instance, I have just read
that the man from whom I am to collect a million dollars sails from
Montreal for Europe next Thursday. This is Tuesday. So we can't
sleep here tonight, Joe. We have no time to lose."</p>

<p>Joe was bewildered by the strangeness and swiftness with which
events happened after that. For the first time Clifton deliberately
halted a car and asked for a ride. At Hamilton he hired another car
and they were off for Toronto. A little later the rush and roar and
electrical glare of the big city engulfed them. Joe clutched his
gun and held so tightly to the string attached to Bim that it cut a
crease in his hand. He was fascinated and appalled, held speechless
and almost powerless to move, and Clifton placed an arm about his
thin shoulders to give him confidence. Brantford had been the hub
of activity and excitement in Joe's little world; Toronto with its
hundreds of thousands was a monster of life and sound that at times
made his heart stop beating.</p>

<p>They came to a building of colossal size about which hundreds of
automobiles were moving like restless bees, and here their own car
stopped and Clifton hurried him out and dragged him along so fast
that he was compelled to trot at his side to keep up. They stopped
at a window, then raced through a gate, and almost as it began to
move they were boarding a train. Bim was hiccoughing and his eyes
were bulging. A five-dollar bill placed him in charge of the
porter.</p>

<p>That night with its dizzy swaying and incessant roar of wheels
was a nightmare in Joe's life. The next day they arrived in
Montreal.</p>

<p>Clifton found writing material at the station, and for half an
hour he was busy while Joe sat watchfully quiet, holding to Bim.
Then he used a telephone to find if a certain Benedict Aldous was
in town. Aldous's housekeeper assured him that he was, whereupon
Clifton pinned the letter he had written in the pocket of Joe's
khaki coat.</p>

<p>"I'm sending you to a friend of mine," he explained, "and you
must give him this letter at once. He will take good care of you
and Bim. I will come to you sometime tonight, or tomorrow. Probably
tonight. I'm going to send my dunnage with you. You aren't afraid,
are you, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Not very, I guess. Why don't you come now?"</p>

<p>"I have some business to attend to."</p>

<p>"Is it the million dollars?"</p>

<p>"You've hit it, Joe. It's the million dollars."</p>

<p>He loaded them into a taxicab and gave the driver written
instructions.</p>

<p>"Good-by!"</p>

<p>As far as his eyes could follow them he saw Joe's pale face
looking back through the window.</p>

<p>For the first time in hours he drew a deep breath of relief. No
matter what happened now Joe would be properly cared for. Benedict
Aldous would see to that. He felt himself at least temporarily
freed from a peculiarly embarrassing responsibility, and he found
his good humor returning as he began to picture the Englishman's
profound amazement when Joe presented himself with his letter.</p>

<p>He wondered if Aldous was as odd and thin and altogether lovable
as in the old days when they had tramped India and Turkestan
together. Of course he would be. It would be rather difficult to
change him. But his blas&eacute; anatomy would receive a thrill
when he learned that his old tramping companion and the savior of
his soul and freedom in the Simla Hills was alive and in town.</p>

<p>Curiously, as he went up the street, Clifton thought of the
vampish little blonde widow who had almost "got" Benedict during
his convalescence from a fever. Maybe she was still hating him for
smuggling Aldous away by force; maybe she had married again; maybe
she was dead. Anyway, Aldous would always love him for the part he
had played in his salvation. The world was a funny place to live
in, filled with funny things and people! And especially the people,
monumental egoists on two legs. They were never tired of playing
out their trivial little comedies and tragedies, with absurd
convictions of their importance.</p>

<p>Personally he was in the same boat himself. He was going to play
a part of his own tonight. If possible he would make of it a
comedy-drama instead of a drab and tiresome tragedy. There should
be something to smile at even in the death of a man like Ivan Hurd,
president and majority owner of the vast interests of the Hurd-Foy
Paper and Pulp Company. At least he hoped there would be the saving
grace of a touch of humor about it.</p>

<p>It was four o'clock by his watch when he came to the corner
where the Hurd-Foy offices had been before the war. A new building
had taken the place of the old one. Its size and massiveness were
emblematic of power and wealth, and carved in stone over the arched
entrance were the words <i>Hurd-Foy Building</i>. Clifton smiled at
them cryptically. Here again was humor if one were of the
disposition to look at it in that way.</p>

<p>He went in, and ascended by means of an elevator to the floor
occupied by the Hurd-Foy offices. It was a quarter after four
o'clock then.</p>

<p>His ears were greeted by the metallic clicking of typewriters,
and he noted that a small army of employees were assembled on this
floor. He took his time. The sumptuousness of the place interested
him. He passed a mirror, and looking into it he wondered if Ivan
Hurd would recognize him. The war had made quite a change in him.
Ten years had increased it.</p>

<p>It was half-past four when he inquired if Ivan Hurd was in.</p>

<p>"He is busy. Will you wait?"</p>

<p>"No," said Clifton. He scribbled a few lines on a pad of paper.
"Please take this to him. It is urgent."</p>

<p>The girl returned shortly. There was a clock on the wall, and
Clifton made note of the fact that it was twenty-five minutes of
five when she led the way for him to Ivan Hurd's office. She left
him with a friendly smile. Something in Clifton's eyes invited her
attention.</p>

<p>He passed in, and as the door closed behind him he turned and
locked it. Even in this act he did not hurry or make an attempt to
conceal his intention. He knew the man seated at the big walnut
desk at the end of the room was watching him, and he had conceived
a mental picture of his astonishment before he faced him. Casually
he surveyed the room. It was very large, entirely done in walnut or
mahogany, with a heavy rose-taupe rug on the floor. At its farther
end was a smaller door sufficiently ajar to give Clifton a glimpse
of a lounge, and he tabulated it instantly as Ivan Hurd's rest
room&mdash;and empty.</p>

<p>Hurd had turned so that he sat facing his visitor. He was a big
man. The hands that gripped the arms of his chair were pudgy and
large. His face and head were round, heavy, immense, throwing back
to his German ancestors. His shoulders, trained down properly,
would have expressed enormous strength. His eyes were light blue
and steely with anger as Clifton tossed his hat carelessly upon a
table, in the center of which stood a tall vase filled with
flowers. In Hurd's mouth was a cigar. It was a mouth supported by a
chin that might have been hewn out of granite. The man's age did
not exceed Clifton's by more than a year or two.</p>

<p>"What did you do to that door?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I locked it," said Clifton.</p>

<p>He sat down, with the long directors' table between him and
Hurd. In the same movement he produced an automatic pistol and
leveled it at the other's breast.</p>

<p>"Don't get up and don't make a sound that can be heard beyond
that door," he warned. "Your one chance of remaining alive another
half-hour depends upon the utter isolation of us two. I have
traveled twenty thousand miles to keep myself from killing you, and
now that nature is having her way I'm not going to make a mess of
the job by doing it in business hours."</p>

<p>A deadly light was in Clifton's eyes. His voice was low but
trembled with a dangerous thrill.</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what in God's name do you want?"</p>

<p>Ivan Hurd was not a coward. He leaned forward, demanding an
answer. The flush was leaving his face. It was turning white.</p>

<p>"You don't know me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Never saw me before?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>For the longest quarter-minute in Ivan Hurd's life Clifton's
eyes remained steadily on his face.</p>

<p>"I think you believe you are telling the truth," he said then.
"I am quite sure you are&mdash;or you would sweat instead of
turning a little pale." He waited a moment, and then added: "I am
the dead man of Haipoong come to life. I am Clifton Brant."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>Clifton was conscious of the ticking of a tiny ivory clock on
the timber king's desk. He had not noticed it before, but now the
sound seemed to break in excitedly upon the dead stillness which
filled the room. From beyond the door came the dully subdued hum
and movement of life which had not made itself noticeable until
now. He heard faintly the passing of footsteps, a girl's laughter,
the indistinct clang of an elevator door. And he fancied he heard a
sound which came from Ivan Hurd's rest room. In that he was sure he
must be mistaken.</p>

<p>In these moments even Hurd's massive chest did not seem to move
as he breathed. He stared at Clifton, and as he stared the flesh of
his body relaxed. The hands that had gripped the arms of his chair
grew limp; his face and jaw began to show saggy lines; the light
blue flame of anger that had leaped into his eyes at the other's
cool impertinence was replaced by a filmy horror. At last he had
recognized the dead man of Haipoong.</p>

<p>He forced himself to speak, and his voice was scarcely above a
hoarse whisper as he looked into the black tube of the automatic
and beyond that into the strangely smiling, terrible face of the
man who held it. He thought of madness, for only a madman could
smile as Clifton was smiling in this moment, without rage or venom,
but with something more appalling in his eyes.</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"You," said Clifton.</p>

<p>With his free hand he drew out his watch and laid it open on the
table. It was two minutes slower than the little ivory clock.</p>

<p>"In eighteen minutes your offices will close," he went on. "Will
anyone remain after that?"</p>

<p>"My secretary."</p>

<p>"And the janitor?"</p>

<p>"He comes at seven."</p>

<p>Clifton nodded toward the house telephone.</p>

<p>"Connect with your secretary and tell that person to leave
promptly at five and see that no one remains after that hour. And
if you make a mistake, Hurd, if your voice is not natural, if you
attempt to arouse the slightest suspicion at the other end of the
wire&mdash;I shall kill you!"</p>

<p>Ivan hesitated with his hand on the telephone. Clifton could see
him swallow. Then he took down the receiver and briefly gave the
instructions to his secretary in a calm and even voice.</p>

<p>Clifton nodded his approbation when it was done.</p>

<p>"I am agreeably surprised with you," he said. "I was afraid one
of your stripe and breed would turn entirely yellow in an hour of
this kind. I don't like killing a coward. It seems too much like
stepping on a worm just through spite."</p>

<p>Hurd made a fighting effort to regain his nerve by lighting the
cigar that had gone out. He wet his lips.</p>

<p>"We can talk business now," he said. "We won't be
interrupted."</p>

<p>"What business?"</p>

<p>For a moment Ivan Hurd caught himself as he was about to speak,
and in that moment his eyes shifted to the partly open door of his
rest room. Then he shrugged, as if he saw checkmate there.</p>

<p>"Money, of course. That's what you want, Brant. Money. How
much?"</p>

<p>A flash of laughter leaped into Clifton's eyes and his face grew
almost friendly as he regarded Hurd.</p>

<p>"I knew something funny would crop up, even here," he exclaimed.
"It always does; it's just another proof that comedy lives next
door to tragedy, and they're always playing in each other's back
yard&mdash;granting you're built up to certain specifications that
don't make you blind. Why, Hurd, I once saw two donkeys, a cart and
a man wiped out of existence by a shell in Flanders and I almost
fainted with horror, but when the smoke and dust cleared away I
began to laugh, for while the donkeys and cart were gone forever
there sat the man, black as a tar baby, without a scratch on him,
and only a little deaf. <i>That</i> was funny. But this is
funnier.</p>

<p>"I don't want your money. This building and all that is in it
couldn't wipe out your debt to me. I want <i>you</i>. And in about
nine minutes I'm going to have you. Imagine yourself,
Hurd&mdash;how funny you will look when your friends find you, all
lopsided and terrible, as I'm going to leave you. You are overfat,
and will present a comical appearance in shrouds. How much do you
weigh?"</p>

<p>"Good God, you are mad!"</p>

<p>"Possibly. You can't cut people up in a country like Haipoong,
have them come to life again, and expect them to be entirely sane,
can you? Just what do you think that you owe me?"</p>

<p>He waited. The sweat of agony was on Ivan Hurd's forehead now,
and Clifton knew the torture that was in his soul.</p>

<p>"For instance," encouraged Clifton, "how much do you consider
your life worth&mdash;to you? Not to the world, because the world
would be better off without it, but to <i>you</i>? Be agreeable,
Hurd, and answer me! It's worth more than all the money you've got,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>The timber king nodded a throaty assent. He could see death in
the steadiness with which the black pit of the gun found the center
of his eyes.</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed Clifton. "One's life is quite frequently
one's most precious asset. My father valued his life very highly,
and it was worth a great deal to me. You killed my father, and I am
his inheritor. You killed him while I was away helping to fight the
battles which made it possible for you to pile up a profiteer's
fortune of more than twenty millions. You grew fat on money while I
lost everything I had in the world.</p>

<p>"Now I have come to collect. You were afraid I would come some
day. I told you I would, when the story of my father's ruin and
death reached me. You received the cards I sent?&mdash;one every
six months for years! Of course you did&mdash;cards which bore
those two unforgettable words of that country of yours which went
to rot&mdash;'<i>der Tag</i>.' You knew you were a murderer and a
thief, even though no technical law could touch you, and you grew
afraid.</p>

<p>"For that reason, when your agents doing business with the
Chinese Government found I was on the Yangtze Kiang job, and then
at Haipoong, you took steps to have me put out of the way, and
thought you were successful. It was a nice, out-of-the-ordinary
place for the extermination of what little was left of the Brant
family, and of course you didn't hear from me after that. Everybody
collected their money. I understand the Haipoong assassins received
eight hundred dollars in American exchange. Your agent, Gottlieb,
must have secured a tidy bit. And now <i>I'm</i> on hand, Hurd. It
lacks one minute of five o'clock. How much do you think you owe
<i>me</i>?"</p>

<p>Clifton had leaned farther over the table. His finger, it seemed
to Hurd, was pressing the trigger of the automatic. The man tried
to speak. His ashen face was damp with sweat. His lips were white.
Saggy lines hung under his eyes and in his cheeks. His hands and
body twitched.</p>

<p>A silvery chime in the little ivory clock struck the hour of
five. A distant door closed. In the stillness no sound of life came
from the outer offices.</p>

<p>Clifton began to count.</p>

<p>"<i>One&mdash;two&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>"Great God, don't shoot!"</p>

<p>"What price! What do you owe me?"</p>

<p>"Anything&mdash;anything you name!"</p>

<p>"Down on your knees, Hurd! <i>Down</i>!"</p>

<p>The great hulk of a man slid from his chair.</p>

<p>"I am giving you five minutes of life. Answer my questions. I
want to hear the truth from your own lips. If you lie I will kill
you instantly. By unfair and criminal methods, yet within the law,
you robbed my father of the Brant timber concessions while I was
away at war. Is it not true?"</p>

<p>The heavy lips moved. "Yes."</p>

<p>"You caused my father's death?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;indirectly&mdash;yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Deliberately you plotted and hired assassins to kill me at
Haipoong?"</p>

<p>The heavy head fell upon the kneeling man's chest, as if he had
lost the strength to support it. A throaty cry came from his lips
and his thick hands covered his face. It was confession.</p>

<p>In that moment if Clifton had looked beyond the man huddled on
the floor he would have seen the restroom door slowly moving.</p>

<p>But his eyes did not leave Ivan Hurd. Here, at last, was
vengeance. Here was justice measuring itself out in its own full
measure. Every line in the timber king's sagging body proclaimed
his hopelessness and his torture. With the stoicism of the breed
from which he had come through two American generations he was
waiting for the end. He was caught, and like his kind&mdash;knowing
no mercy&mdash;he expected none. A great sack of quivering flesh,
with his head bowed like a dull-witted ostrich, this man of
millions, this power in finance, this war-evading political
influence was stricken to the soul by the <i>little black tube of
the automatic</i>!</p>

<p>And now, as he promised himself in this hour, Clifton laughed.
It was a clean, joyous laugh, and in it was the ring of exultation
and triumph. Ivan Hurd raised his head. His bloodless face met
Clifton's. He saw the other's fingers working at the cartridge clip
in the butt of the automatic. The clip came out. It sailed through
the air toward him and fell with a tinny clatter at his knees. With
pudgy, nervous fingers he picked it up. It was light. It was
empty.</p>

<p>The automatic had not been loaded.</p>

<p>He pulled himself up, swaying, and sagged into his chair. The
gasping breath that came into his body was like a sob.</p>

<p>Clifton's laughter had subdued itself to a chuckling smile. He
laid his impotent gun upon the table.</p>

<p>"Did I frighten you, Ivan?"</p>

<p>"By God&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man wiped his face with his naked palms. Mottled spots
appeared in his flesh where its ghastliness gave way to a rush of
blood. The sagginess began to leave his body.</p>

<p>Clifton was taking off his coat.</p>

<p>"The trouble with you people of Hunnish blood is that you lack
the artistic sense," he said, "and that is because you never have
the true composition of humor. You make pretty baubles and paint
fairly well, but when it comes to the art of dying, and of killing,
you are absurdly crude. Now I have come to collect a million
dollars, and I am going to show you how it can be done in a pretty
way. I don't want it in cash because I hate money, generally
speaking. But I am going to collect a million dollars' worth of
satisfaction from you, and I am going to take it out of your hide.
Killing with the naked hands has its virtue. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>He came around the end of the table. Hurd stared up, gripping
the arms of his chair again. With the flat of his hand Clifton
struck him in the face.</p>

<p>With an oath Hurd was on his feet. The Hun possessed him again.
He no longer faced death, or even the threat of death. He had been
terrified, humiliated, and now he was slapped! And all this by a
man who had imposed upon him with an unloaded gun, a man who was
lighter than he, smaller, slimmer, lithely boyish in comparison
with his bulk.</p>

<p>Hun-like he sensed the atrociousness of it all, the unfairness
of any enemy playing his own game, or tricking him, or touching him
in that way with his hand. He was like a drowning devil, who,
praying one moment, found his feet touching solid bottom in the
next. His colossal egoism returned and his bullying nature leaped
out from the concealment where fear had driven it. To Clifton the
transformation was disgustingly amusing. He saw an ox shedding its
skin and assuming the form of a lion.</p>

<p>Hurd was throwing off his coat. His cuff links rattled. His
watch-chain flopped up and down his vest. He was surprisingly
active for a man of his superfluous weight and there was something
demoniacally murderous in his rush upon Clifton. He had seized the
vase with its flowers, and it preceded him, touching Clifton's
shoulder in its passage, and crashed into a thousand pieces against
the wall. Then he let out a moaning grunt, for Clifton met him
fairly in the face and slammed a fist deep into his fatty
paunch.</p>

<p>They clinched. That was as Clifton wanted it. Pugilistic science
would have been an insult to his intentions. He wanted Hurd to feel
the tiger in him at close quarters, to come in touch flesh to flesh
with the pent-up fury that had been gathering and waiting for this
moment through many years. A possible blow might have settled it,
but Hurd, inanimate or dead, was beyond the reach of his
punishment; alive, choking, cursing; feeling himself losing inch by
inch, at last facing blackness and the end&mdash;in that way he
would be paying his debt. They crashed against the table, and in
this first contact Clifton was amazed at the other's hardness.
Hurd's arms and shoulders were more like solid wood than living
tissue, and they possessed a strength he had not guessed at. A
month in the woods and he would have been a giant.</p>

<p>His own strength, dominating every fiber of a body trained by
walking and the out-of-doors, was like a voltaic force swiftly
adjustable to given situations, and realizing instantly his error
in judgment he struck up at Hurd. He heard the man's jaw snap. They
went down and under the table. Even then Clifton sensed a certain
ludicrousness about it&mdash;two grown men rolling on a rug under a
table! He could have wished the scene to have been attended with a
little more dignity. The table upset. It came down sideways on
them, then rolled over, so that they were flattened under it like
two struggling insects under a chip.</p>

<p>But they were fighting. His fingers were at Hurd's throat. They
came out, and he began pounding at the round, huge head, and
then&mdash;being the first on his feet&mdash;he saw his opportunity
to grip both hands under Hurd's chin and rip his collar, shirt and
vest from his body. The rending of cloth was the last touch to the
table-comedy. It left an exposure of Hurd's body up the middle from
his belt-band to his chin. When he stood up his collar and tie hung
down over one shoulder. His watch was out and dangled at the end of
its chain. His fob and diamond pin were on the floor. And Clifton,
a little disheveled and with a livid bruise on his forehead, was
coolly laughing at him.</p>

<p>The sound Hurd made in his throat might have been that of a
great frog. His eyes, it seemed to Clifton, were greenish-red in
their rage. His mouth was a little open, and he was sucking in air
in quick gasps as he made another rush. His powerful arms were out,
his fingers extended like talons for Clifton's neck, when in a
swift movement Clifton performed the boy's trick of making himself
a stumbling-block in front of his adversary, and Hurd pitched over
him and fell to the floor with a crash that sent a tremor through
the room.</p>

<p>Clifton recovered himself in time to see the other's watch,
rolling in a wobbly fashion across the rug, and Hurd's great legs
half in the air, with a broken red and white garter trailing from
the back of one shoe. In an instant he was at him, tearing at his
garments and beating the bullish head each time it bobbed up.</p>

<p>Hurd had given him the inspiration!&mdash;it was a humiliation
that would hurt more than physical defeat. The Imperial Instinct
was in this Americanized Hun even more than he had thought it would
be. To strip Hurd, to leave him naked, to make him a creature of
helplessness and self-abasement in his own eyes, drinking to the
dregs of humiliation and shame, would be worse than death, leaving
in his soul a sore that would burn and fester as long as he lived.
With brain and body Clifton leaped to the idea, and for a space he
forgot every rule of the game and every instinct of conventional
decency as he grappled with the man he hated and whom he had
promised himself some day to kill.</p>

<p>And now, if Clifton had noticed, the rest-room door was wide
open.</p>

<p>But blindness possessed him, blindness and a fury which until
now he had held in leash behind a smile. Their bodies fought from
side to side of the room. Chairs fell about them, and one broke
into wreckage under their weight. Twice they rolled close to the
rest-room door. Hurd's breath came sobbingly and his mouth was open
whenever Clifton saw it&mdash;open and bleeding; his garments were
in rags, his arms naked, his hairy chest and puffy abdomen exposed.
Then the reaction seized upon Clifton, and he sprang to his feet.
Hurd followed, and Clifton knocked him down. He had never known a
head which could stand half the beating which he gave Hurd's after
that. The skull was either of iron&mdash;or enormously thick, he
thought.</p>

<p>At last it was over. Hurd was still conscious, but utterly done
for, and his puffy, half-open eyes looked up from the floor at
Clifton with an expression of filmy inanity. Clifton, standing over
him, recalled the incident of a huge fatted hog which he had helped
to rescue from the mire of a shell hole in Belgium. Hurd was like
that, wheezing and gulping and choking for breath in the same way,
as if his lungs were filled with mud. Clifton straightened the desk
armchair and dragged Hurd to it. All of his strength was required
to get the heavy body into it, but the result was worth the
effort.</p>

<p>As he stood back to observe his handiwork he laughed again.</p>

<p>Hurd, with his backbone gone, was two hundred pounds of formless
flesh. He was not tragic, as Clifton viewed him. He was not even
horrible, though he was puffed up and bloody and scarcely resembled
a man. But he was grotesquely funny. There was something quizzical
and bizarre in the glassy way his eyes held their focus on the man
who had so successfully collected his debt. He was like a clown who
had suffered mishap in the midst of his buffoonery. To Clifton the
sublimity of the situation was in the fact that he knew Hurd was
perfectly conscious of his own presence, of what had happened, and
of his own monstrous appearance&mdash;yet was physically incapable
of moving even one of his cumbrous hands.</p>

<p>The thrill in Clifton was one of immeasurable joy and
satisfaction. How stupid it had been of him ever to have dreamed of
killing Hurd! This was better. Memory of this hour would live
through Hurd's life with the vividness of a scar branded across his
face. It was like the breaking of the Kaiser, he thought. Better to
let him live and suffer than to have him die and end it all.</p>

<p>He felt a growing dizziness. Hurd had struck him over the head
with a rung from the broken chair and he had not sensed its effect
until now. He drew nearer and bent over Hurd. The glassy eyes
followed him without the visible movement of a muscle in Hurd's
face and an apish desire to do mischief seized upon Clifton. He
stuck a pen behind Hurd's ear. He placed an open book on his lap.
From a humidor on the desk he took a big black cigar and thrust it
into Hurd's mouth. The cigar hung there, a bit droopy, but
fixed.</p>

<p>Then Clifton picked up his automatic and the clip and pulled
himself together before a mirror. He looked at Hurd again, but the
dizziness kept him from laughing as he wanted to laugh, and also it
kept him from saying what he had intended to say before he left his
victim&mdash;granting he was in a condition to understand. But even
with his dizziness he saw a last possibility. He took Hurd's hat
from a pedestal at the end of the desk and placed it at a rakish
angle on the back of Hurd's head.</p>

<p>Then he turned to unlock the door. It was odd, he thought, how
his fingers blundered. He opened the door and went out, closing it
after him. In the railed enclosure just outside were several chairs
and he sat down in one of these. His dizziness would leave in a
minute or two, he told himself. But it was deucedly inconvenient
just at the present moment.</p>

<p>He heard a big clock ticking on the wall and tried to make out
the time, but the hands were muddled.</p>

<p>He noticed the sun coming in at a distant window, and between
him and that sun the desks and chairs were confused and
indistinct.</p>

<p>He covered his eyes with his hands and waited.</p>

<p>The big clock ticked on. The moments sped. And then an alarming
thing startled him.</p>

<p>It was a peal of laughter. It was not loud. It was a girl's
laughter, or a woman's, and there was a distinctly sweet and
musical quality about it. Clifton started to his feet. The amazing
thing was that the laughter had come from Ivan Hurd's room!</p>

<p>It was not repeated. For a space Clifton held his breath, and
then the voice of merriment came again from beyond the timber
king's door, and this time he heard it say:</p>

<p>"<i>Oh, Mr. Hurd, you look so funny!</i>"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>A woman's scream coming from Hurd's room would have startled
Clifton, but it would have sunk no deeper than what he whimsically
called his secondary emotion. A scream was not an unusual thing.
More often than not a woman screamed without reason or
judgment&mdash;at a mouse, a bug, a splash of mud or water on her
dress, and surely he would have expected one to scream if she had
come suddenly upon a man sitting as Hurd was now sitting in his
office chair.</p>

<p>But to <i>laugh</i>...</p>

<p>He took a step toward the door, wondering how much his dizziness
had to do with what he had heard. His first impulse was to open it
and look in; his second held him back as the significance of a
feminine presence in Hurd's room pressed itself upon him. Whoever
she was he could hear her moving about, or possibly it was Hurd
making an effort to get on his feet. Then the laugh came again. It
was not loud or hysterical, but was very soft, and with a
genuineness of humor in it that was like the spontaneity of water
rippling over little stones. It was almost a giggle.</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath into his empty lungs. This, to say the
least, was an unexpected and rather astounding situation. He had
observed that Hurd's private office occupied the extreme corner of
the building. Except through the main door there could be no other
means of exit or ingress unless one climbed through a window seven
floors above the street.</p>

<p>There remained only one conclusion and as its weight settled
upon Clifton he drew cautiously away from the door. The rest room
had concealed someone while he and Ivan Hurd were fighting. That
person was young, if he could guess anything by her voice. She was
with Hurd when the office girl had taken in his note saying he had
five minutes in which personally to give the timber king an
important message from certain large interests in Toronto. Hurd had
asked her to step into the smaller room for a few moments, and from
there she had witnessed the entire affair from its melodramatic
beginning to its farcical ending. Now she had come out after the
storm, was surveying its victim, and instead of being horrified or
frightened she found him an object which had roused in her a most
exceptional sense of humor&mdash;for her sex!</p>

<p>He made this mental reservation as he continued his retreat
toward the main corridor. He would have expected a man to laugh,
unless a certain part of his brain had gone completely dead. Hurd
was funny as he had left him in his chair, pulpy and almost
lifeless, his piggy eyes half open, the pen behind his ear, the
cigar in his mouth, the hat at a rakish angle on his
head!&mdash;unforgettably funny from a masculine point of view. But
from a woman's, or a girl's&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, the world was changing, and changing swiftly. He had seen
a lot of it during the last ten years. He had especially noticed it
because he had spent recent years in places where there was never
change. Women were different. They no longer ran true to type. They
were smoking, and quarreling in public places, and fighting in
politics, and everlastingly bobbing their heads. Their velvety
sympathy was giving way to something else. They could box a man's
ears as well as melt into tears. They cried less and fought more,
and tears were a politic asset which frequently denoted wisdom
instead of weakness. Quite logically they were also developing a
new sense of humor as they became more intimate with men and their
ways.</p>

<p>That was why the girl had laughed at Hurd, and Clifton found a
strong undercurrent of approval running through him as he punched
an elevator button.</p>

<p>His head grew muddled as the elevator went down with him. He saw
several faces where there should have been one, and he was
conscious of holding himself up stiffly, like an intoxicated person
struggling to appear normal. It was impossible for him to get out
of his vision the bobbed head of the girl who was running the car.
It was like all other bobbed heads, irritatingly common and
offensive to everything that was esthetic in man. Why didn't such
women wear rings in their noses, he wondered, and blacken their
teeth, and pull out what few hairs they had left in their eyebrows?
Back of his dizziness he had the curious feeling that he had almost
come in contact with at least one person who had not performed that
idiotic amputation of her hair. She was the girl in Hurd's room. No
"bobbed" girl would have a voice or a laugh like hers.</p>

<p>Clifton met the first draught of cool air from outside with an
audible gasp. It was like a tonic, and helped to settle his stomach
back in its place. For several minutes he stood leaning against the
stone entrance, drinking it in. Then he took off his hat and ran a
hand through his hair. There was a lump where the chair-rung had
hit him. A little more and Hurd would have laid him out. He moved
away from the Hurd-Foy Building and walked up the street. It was
six o'clock when he dropped into an inconspicuous cafe and called
for a pot of strong black tea.</p>

<p>After that he sauntered up Sherbrooke in the direction of Mount
Royal. He was all right again and his old cheer began to return.
With it came also a new sense of exhilaration, almost of freedom.
He had dreaded this meeting with Ivan Hurd, not because he was
afraid for himself but because of what might happen to the other.
Now it was over, and luck had been entirely with him. His
imagination could not have conceived a more satisfactory and at the
same time a more harmless punishment for Hurd. He had scarred a
soul without taking a life, and Hurd would die with the gall of it
in his heart.</p>

<p>As he walked under the thick canopy of the trees that made a
cool green corridor of the old highway he meditated on Joe's
arrival at Benedict's, and what had happened there. Of course it
would be a big surprise, dropping in on him like this&mdash;right
out of the grave, you might call it. He could see Benedict pumping
Joe down to the last drop of information that was in the boy,
doubting to the very last that the dead man of Haipoong had
actually turned up alive.</p>

<p>Good old Benedict! He began to moralize a little about him, that
lovable, ungainly, preposterously careless and altogether fearless
one man in the world who cared as little for entanglements with
women as he did himself. His adventure with the little Simla widow
was his one fall from grace so far as Clifton knew. Clifton
wondered why it was that at infrequent intervals some pertinacious
little devil would prod his memory with that particular incident.
At those times he could see the widow as clearly as he had ever
seen her in the flesh six years ago, with her romp of short gold
curls, her vivid blue eyes, her mouth that was always pursing
itself up into little round O's of delighted enthusiasm or
attention&mdash;and the height of her&mdash;which was just enough
to reach Benedict's arm when it was held straight out from his
body. He had seen her standing in that silly way one day, measuring
herself.</p>

<p>Of course she was pretty. Benedict's judgment wasn't wrong
there. She was twenty-six, and seemed to tell the truth about it.
The Afghans had shot up her subaltern husband six months after they
were married, when she was twenty-one. Quite naturally she wanted
another, and had made a strong play for Benedict. She would have
got him, too, if it hadn't been for his own strategic generalship
in the matter. Possibly he had been a little unfair, but as his
opponent was a widow, and short-haired, his conscience had never
pricked him.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to Clifton that he had heard in the widow's
voice something of that same infectious sweetness which had come
from Hurd's room. Funny. It was her laugh which had attracted
Benedict first&mdash;made him crane his neck over the top of a
hedge to see who it came from. Voices like that were dangerous and
could cover up an enormous amount of deviltry. On the spur of the
moment he had almost opened the door of Hurd's room, just because
of such a voice. He was curious enough to reflect upon what he
might have seen. Probably someone whom Hurd was going to take out
to dinner. Yet there was a flaw in that supposition, for an invited
guest would scarcely have found entertainment in what had
happened.</p>

<p>He made no great mental effort to solve the mystery.</p>

<p>Nor did he make haste to reach the gloomy old stone house in the
midst of its big garden, where Aldous lived. This place was
ancestral down to its last stone, for an adventurous Aldous who was
associated with the Hudson's Bay Company had come over from London
and built it a hundred and sixty years before, and it never had
been out of the hands of some scion of the English line since that
day. Clifton remembered how the Simla widow had raved about its
possibilities, its ghosts and its weirdly improbable stories, and
how prosaic Benedict had fluffed up and colored like a pleased
little child at her talk. The widow would have liked that
place!</p>

<p>He came to it at last, away back in the deep gloom of the
three-hundred-year-old trees where the Indians used to hold their
councils with the white adventurers who were blazing trails into
the hinterlands. It was aglow with light, just as Clifton had seen
it on another night more than ten years ago&mdash;dully aglow, as
if its illumination were still made by candles instead of
electricity. The small windows gave that effect. Clifton's heart
was beating a little faster when he reached the entrance. It was
thrilling, this coming back from the dead. And he loved
Benedict.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the dull clang of the knocker sounded from within
when he heard approaching footsteps. He would have known them among
a thousand, those steady, long-gaited steps of Benedict's, never
excited or in undue haste, no matter what lay in front or what was
coming from behind. The door opened, and Benedict's six feet three
inches of oddly thin and slightly stooping figure filled his
vision. Of course there was no change. He had expected none.
Benedict's scarce blond hair was no thinner, the wisp of a mustache
was still under his nose, his cravat had the same careless twist,
there were ashes on his smoking-jacket, and his arms were&mdash;as
they had always been&mdash;too long for his sleeves.</p>

<p>They looked at each other.</p>

<p>"By Jove, if it isn't the old boy himself, true as life!"
exclaimed Benedict.</p>

<p>Clifton knew it would be something like that, a greeting with no
emotional fireworks. They gripped hands, all four together, and the
thrill went through them. It glowed in their eyes. It quivered on
their voiceless lips. It twisted at their hearts and stirred their
blood with a steady heat. They were two men who would die one for
the other. For a few moments they did not speak or close the door.
There was a moist glisten in Benedict's pale blue eyes. Clifton
knew the same was in his own. Then he laughed. It was a bit
nervous.</p>

<p>"How's Bones?" he asked. Bones was the nickname he had given
Benedict the first time he had seen him stripped to the skin, with
all of his joints revealed.</p>

<p>Benedict closed the door, put a long arm about Clifton's
shoulders and walked with him down a low-ceilinged hall into a
great room where half the odds and ends of the earth were hanging
on the walls.</p>

<p>He picked up a cigaret case in which was a dent made by a partly
spent bullet, and extended it to Clifton.</p>

<p>"Have one?" he asked.</p>

<p>By this time two tears had gathered triumphantly in the corners
of his eyes, and Clifton, lighting a cigaret, brushed a hand across
his own.</p>

<p>"Sure!" he said. "I haven't smoked a cigaret since our tiger
hunt at Djharling."</p>

<p>That was the week they had separated, Benedict returning to an
important matter in England, Clifton making his plans for
China.</p>

<p>Neither sensed the passing of the first hour, or the beginning
of the second. There was a lot to be talked about, when the talking
began, without anything to interrupt them. Joe was in bed, Bim was
in the garage, and the old house was very still. In that first hour
of their renewed comradeship little that was ancient history
repeated itself. Clifton told of the affair at Haipoong, and
Benedict's eyes took on their old peculiar glitter when he heard of
the thrills he had missed, and why Clifton had kept his escape to
himself. The glitter became a deep and appreciative fire with
laughter behind it when he learned of the final vengeance meted out
to Ivan Hurd. He chuckled. Benedict's chuckle was infinitely more
eloquent than laughter; it was something no one could forget, a
mellow vibration of every vocal expression that was in him.</p>

<p>"I feel better now," finished Clifton. "I was a bit of a coward
for a long time, afraid I would kill Hurd if I came back. Now it's
settled, and in a better way. I feel good about it. I can settle
down at last."</p>

<p>They talked about Joe, and of what had happened to them in the
years since their parting at Djharling. Clifton, of course, had
continued his wandering and had seen a large part of Asia. Benedict
had slumped, he admitted. Actually began taking on flesh for a
time. Lazed in England for a year, went over to Egypt, then came to
the place he liked best of all quiet places&mdash;this house on the
big hill overlooking Montreal. He loved Montreal. It was the one
city in the world&mdash;that and Quebec&mdash;to dream one's dreams
of the past in. Of course, if he had known Clifton was alive and in
China, or Timbuctoo, or any place in the Antipodes&mdash;</p>

<p>He shrugged his baggy shoulders.</p>

<p>"I'd have looked you up, old chap," he said.</p>

<p>They fell back upon old days instead of making plans for new
ones. Clifton had never been quite so happy, not for many years. He
told Benedict so frankly. He never wanted another thrill or another
shock. He was glad to be home, and didn't think he would ever go
very far away again&mdash;unless Benedict insisted.</p>

<p>He picked up the silver cigaret case. Reminiscence twinkled in
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Remember the Simla widow?" he asked.</p>

<p>Benedict was visibly flustered. He tried to laugh, and failed
miserably. Clifton was delighted.</p>

<p>"Remember the day she tried to baby you out of this cigaret
case?" he went on. "I was behind the hedge, and heard her!"</p>

<p>"You bally scoundrel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never saw her look cuter than she did that day, Bones, with her
curls all freshly done up and the sun in them&mdash;that is, if you
like short curls. She said that as this case had saved your life by
stopping a Hun bullet she'd like to treasure it all her own, if you
would be so kind as to let her have it. And you would have&mdash;if
I hadn't appeared on the scene. Close shave for you, that was!"</p>

<p>"It was," agreed Benedict.</p>

<p>"Wonder what became of the widow," mused Clifton. "She's rather
a setting to our Simla Hills adventures and I sometimes wonder what
happened to her. She was a man-getter and I'll wager she laid one
out at last."</p>

<p>Benedict hid himself behind a screen of cigaret smoke.</p>

<p>"No doubt, old chap. She wasn't the kind to give up."</p>

<p>"Never been sorry I got you away, have you?"</p>

<p>"I've been happier every day."</p>

<p>"I knew you would. You're not the sort to get married."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't marry the best woman in the world," said Benedict,
reappearing through the smoke.</p>

<p>"Neither would I."</p>

<p>Benedict mixed himself a mild whisky and soda.</p>

<p>"You must admit she was rather nice," he argued.</p>

<p>"Who? The widow?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"A nice little devil," agreed Clifton. "Yellow bobbed hair, blue
eyes, a baby mouth&mdash;Lord, what a dance she would have led you
into if I hadn't pulled you away from her bait! I'd rather be back
in my grave at Haipoong than meet such a fate as that, Bones."</p>

<p>Benedict's chuckle filled the room.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, now that you've settled with Hurd?"
he asked in his slow, drawling voice. "Buy a farm?"</p>

<p>Clifton grew serious. He got up and walked slowly back and forth
across the room.</p>

<p>"I've come back to begin where I left off," he said, stopping
before the other and looking down at him. "Benedict, when I left
Quebec woods ten years ago I had hope and ambition, and
somehow&mdash;you know how as well as I&mdash;the war took
everything out of me. Ruin and death came to the last of my family
while I was over there trying to do something for the ones who
brought it about. I wanted to kill a certain man. The disease
worked in me. And the war itself made me learn to hate&mdash;not so
much the men I was fighting against&mdash;but my own people, the
stay-at-homes, the cowards, the money-grabbers; I saw delusion,
fraud, hypocrisy, rotting principles, and I acknowledge I was a
fool. I began to wander about, like a lot of others who went
through that fuss, and the world soon let me know how funny I was.
Three years with you helped me a lot, and I've picked up ever
since. Now I'm back, and I'm never going away again!"</p>

<p>"Bravo!" applauded Benedict.</p>

<p>Clifton's face was radiant.</p>

<p>"I want quiet and peace forevermore," he went on. "I'm going
back to the only love I have, the forests. First I'm going to take
a walk up through French Quebec, where people live as quietly as
they did two hundred years ago. From now on until I die I don't
want to be startled or thrilled or excited. Those moments with Ivan
Hurd were the last.</p>

<p>"I want nothing more than the stillness of the Peribonka, the
swashbuckling roar of the glorious Mistassini, the sun-filled
valleys of peace and quiet about Lake St. John, where the women
still bake their bread outdoors and the men drive horses instead of
automobiles. I want to go into the woods with the men from
Metabetchewan again, and I'm homesick to walk down that one long
street in Chicoutimi, with its smell of logs and pulpwood and its
tolling of cathedral bells. I tell you, Benedict, I'm for all time
tired of changes, emotions, surprises, shock. I want peace,
quiet&mdash;"</p>

<p>Benedict's ungainly form was rising. He had a look in his face
that stopped Clifton.</p>

<p>"Clifton&mdash;old chap&mdash;beg pardon!"</p>

<p>Clifton, with his mouth still open, turned about.</p>

<p>Benedict's hand sought his arm, as if to give him support, and
from what seemed a vast distance away he heard Benedict's
chuckle.</p>

<p>"My wife, old top!"</p>

<p>In the doorway, smiling at him, stood a little vision of white
and gold. It was the Simla widow!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>There she stood, not a day older than she was six years
ago&mdash;the same yellow hair, the same eyes, the same baby
roundness to her smiling red mouth, the same white dress, the same
flowery slimness, the same ineradicable <i>something</i> about her
that proclaimed her a man-killing rogue right now!</p>

<p>For she was smiling at him, her eyes were shining, her mouth was
a round O of delight as she looked at
him&mdash;seductive&mdash;deceitful&mdash;impertinent&mdash;undeniably
pretty!</p>

<p><i>Benedict's wife</i>!</p>

<p>He continued to stare. His mouth closed slowly. The strength
seemed to go out of his legs and body. There was no
deception&mdash;he was looking at the only person on earth he had
ever been afraid of, the woman who had tried to steal Benedict, and
who at last had succeeded! Ivan Hurd's blow with the chair rung had
had a less stunning effect than this. He gulped, struggling for a
word. And he found three.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was laughing! He had always sworn that her round mouth and
little white teeth were what had softened Benedict's brain for a
time. They were still working, that mouth and the teeth&mdash;and
the laugh, too. She had the same perfume, very faint but
effective&mdash;something that stole upon one's senses unfairly,
like a thief.</p>

<p>And then, before he could get out of its way, or guess at it, or
raise so much as a finger to defend himself&mdash;something
happened. The Simla widow&mdash;it was impossible for him to get
that name for her out of his head!&mdash;was at his side. In that
moment he could not have moved if death had been an inch away. It
all happened in an instant. Her arms were around his neck&mdash;she
was on tiptoe straining her slim body to reach him&mdash;she kissed
him on the mouth!</p>

<p>That kiss was like an explosion inside him upsetting everything
that it had taken him years to build up. It was not a quick,
apologetic, Platonic kiss&mdash;it was warm, friendly, loving. The
touch of the soft mouth was the newest, most astounding thing on
earth to Clifton. It came and went like an electrical thrill. He
gazed about him in a dazed fashion. He saw a chair, and sank into
it.</p>

<p>"Lord, deliver us!" he gasped, looking up at them.</p>

<p>They stood before him like two children, hand in hand, one so
ridiculously small and pretty and the other so absurdly tall and
angular. And Benedict's face was foolish with happiness!</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad you're not dead!" the widow was purring, and
she freed her hand to clasp it with the other in an ecstatic
movement at her breast. "When we heard the nasty Chinamen had
killed you I cried for a week. Didn't I, lover?" she asked, looking
up with adoration at Benedict.</p>

<p>Benedict's chortling chuckle accompanied his nod.</p>

<p>"We've been married for two years, three months and seventeen
days counting from ten o'clock this morning," she went on.
"Benedict and I were so sorry you didn't know about our happiness
before you died!"</p>

<p>Her blue eyes were like a baby's, earnest and truthful and with
the last glimmer of coquettishness and laughter gone out of them.
It was that look which Clifton had feared most in the days when he
had fought to save Benedict.</p>

<p>Then he noticed that her hair was no longer short or in curls.
It was a glowing yellow mass about her small head. Its simplicity
was stunning. She was quick to see his look.</p>

<p>"I began to let my hair grow three years ago&mdash;on account of
you," she said. "Benedict said that was why you wouldn't let us get
married. Didn't you, lover?"</p>

<p>Again Benedict nodded&mdash;like a big, overgrown baby, it
seemed to Clifton.</p>

<p>Slowly Clifton rose from his chair. It was odd, he thought, that
he felt neither foolish nor embarrassed. His sensation was more
like that of an old man, as if years had somehow undermined his
feet suddenly. He was sure of one thing&mdash;he would be
white-headed before he ceased to be an idiot!</p>

<p>The Simla widow had beaten him&mdash;and he held out both
hands.</p>

<p>"Now that it's all over, <i>I'm glad</i>," he said. "I guess,
after all, poor old Bones needs a child like you to care for him.
I'm not your enemy any more. I&mdash;by George, now that I see you
together as you are, both stupidly in love after two years, three
months and seventeen days&mdash;I love you almost as much as I do
Bones!" In that moment the telephone rang.</p>

<p>"I'll answer it," said the widow, and left him alone with
Benedict.</p>

<p>"Now, what the devil!" he demanded in a fierce whisper. "How did
it happen? Why didn't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"She wouldn't let me," replied Benedict also <i>sotto voce</i>,
answering the last question first. "Really, she wouldn't, old chap.
When Joe brought the message that you were alive, and would be up
tonight, she insisted on giving you a surprise&mdash;a pleasant
one, she called it&mdash;and so she sent the children to bed
early&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;what?" gasped Clifton.</p>

<p>"The children," repeated Benedict. "We have two of our
own&mdash;little Clairette, after her mother, and Benedict Junior,
the rascal, after me&mdash;and with Joe that made three to get rid
of."</p>

<p>"My God!" breathed Clifton.</p>

<p>"We want two more," said Benedict, "and then we're going to
quit. Bally good job, I call it!"</p>

<p>The Simla widow reappeared.</p>

<p>"Benedict, there is a lady on the telephone asking for
you&mdash;and at this hour! Who is she?"</p>

<p>"I can't guess," said Benedict. "I'll find out."</p>

<p>"Two of them&mdash;two of them already," mumbled Clifton, gazing
after him. "Two&mdash;two&mdash;<i>two</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Clifton?"</p>

<p>It was the first time she had called him by that name, and she
was so absurdly friendly about it, as if she had been a sister to
him all his life, that it was impossible for him not to smile back
into her eyes.</p>

<p>"You're a&mdash;little brick!" he exclaimed. "Benedict just told
me about the children. Is he spoofing me?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed."</p>

<p>"A boy and a girl?"</p>

<p>She nodded. They could hear Benedict's voice droning at the
telephone. "Little Benedict is four months old day after tomorrow
at a quarter after nine o'clock in the morning, and he looks just
like his father," she explained.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Clifton grinned, and a frown puckered the Simla widow's
white forehead.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" he asked then. "Benedict was about to tell
me when you called him to the telephone. I thought I had cured you
both up in the Simla Hills!"</p>

<p>Benedict's wife dropped her eyes like a child under inquisition,
and her fingers played together for a moment in front of her, as if
she were puzzled to find an answer. No wonder poor Benedict had
been unable to resist her!</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I followed him to England," she said.</p>

<p>"You did&mdash;that?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But when I got there he was gone again, so I followed him
to Egypt."</p>

<p>She didn't look up, but she could hear Clifton swallow.</p>

<p>"I missed him there," she went on, a penitence so soft that it
was almost tearful in her voice, "and I had to go back&mdash;and as
I knew I couldn't be happy without him&mdash;I followed him to
Canada. We were married right away."</p>

<p>Clifton dropped back into Benedict's big armchair with a
groan.</p>

<p>"And I returned to Canada to get away from changes, emotions,
surprise, shock!" he mumbled to himself. "I came for a nice quiet
time&mdash;and I find&mdash;"</p>

<p>Benedict interrupted him. He stood in the doorway. His face had
a look in it that reminded Clifton of the days when they had
listened to the smash of German shells.</p>

<p>"By Jove, the police are on their way!"</p>

<p>"The police?"</p>

<p>"That's what she says&mdash;the girl on the telephone. She won't
give her name but seems to know a lot about what happened up at
Hurd's. You didn't tell me about her."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," said Clifton, rising. "Did she have a nice
voice?"</p>

<p>"Deucedly to the point, old chap. She insists that Hurd knows
you are here and that he has already left with the officers. She
gives you five minutes in which to get away, and she wanted me to
thank you for what you did to the infernal scoundrel. Said you'd
better beat it. Those were the words she used&mdash;<i>beat
it!</i>"</p>

<p>"I guess she is right," agreed Clifton. "I didn't think Hurd
would go to the police."</p>

<p>Benedict's wife clutched his arm. He had never seen in her eyes
anything like the fire that flashed in them now.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the beast!" she exclaimed. "Why didn't you kill him
instead of propping him up in that chair like a big pig? I'd have
choked him with the cigar instead of leaving it in his mouth! I'd
have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you know about Hurd?" he asked in amazement. "You
weren't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I <i>was</i>," she interrupted him. "I couldn't help
stealing down to see how you would take it when Benedict told you I
was his wife. But he forgot, or was afraid, and so I listened to
what you said about Hurd. I hate him! And if he dares to come
<i>here</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Benedict had gone to the window.</p>

<p>"I can see the lights of a car through the trees," he announced
in a mild voice. "It's stopping in front. If you want to be sure of
that walk through French Quebec, old chap, I'd advise you to make a
leg of it until the thing blows over a little. Ivan Hurd has a mean
influence with the city police."</p>

<p>Clifton's face darkened and his hands slowly clenched.</p>

<p>"I thought we had ended it," he said. "I was sure Ivan Hurd
would consider the beating I gave him a cheap way of canceling his
debt to me. But if he is determined to go on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I must tell you about Hurd," said Benedict, speaking hurriedly.
"He is a member of the Provincial Parliament and heads the most
powerful reactionary bloc that has ever existed in Quebec politics.
He has grafted millions, and his wealth and influence are enormous.
Up at Parliament House they call him <i>Le Taureau</i>&mdash;the
Bull. He is merciless to those who dare to become his enemies, and
therefore few oppose him. At the present moment&mdash;and
especially for you&mdash;he is the most dangerous man in
Canada!"</p>

<p>"And yet, only a few hours ago, I discovered him to be a yellow
coward," said Clifton.</p>

<p>"Men of his type are always cowards&mdash;when the final moment
comes. That is why Hurd will kill you if he ever gets the chance to
do it or have it done in a way harmless to himself&mdash;because
you are the only man living who has broken through his veneer to
reveal him as he really is. If you two had been alone he might have
kept the thing to himself and stalked you on the quiet. But you
weren't, old chap. A woman or a girl was there, and when you strip
a man to his yellow soul before someone he'd give half his life to
keep that secret from, why&mdash;" Benedict paused with a
suggestive shrug of his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Listen!" cried the Simla widow softly.</p>

<p>"They're coming up the gravel," said Benedict.</p>

<p>His voice had fallen back into its drawling coolness. He lighted
a cigaret.</p>

<p>"Have you good evidence of the Haipoong affair?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Lost," replied Clifton tersely. "I think the evidence was
killed. Anyway he disappeared a month before I left
Indo-China."</p>

<p>Benedict nodded.</p>

<p>"Remember the day we ran away from the mud huts up on the
Irawadi?" he asked. "We weren't afraid, old top. Just policy."</p>

<p>Clifton grinned.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Bones. I'll go. You'll hear from me soon. Do you
suppose the Little Captain here will let you join me later up
Mistassiniway, just for a peaceful hike?"</p>

<p>"If you hurry&mdash;yes," cried Benedict's wife, a sharp little
tremble in her voice. "Quick&mdash;they're coming up the steps!
Don't let them in, Benedict! We'll go out through the door in the
cellar!"</p>

<p>She was gripping Clifton's thumb in her hand, and somehow he
found himself hurrying at her side, across the hall, through a door
and down a narrow stairway into cool darkness that in another
moment was illuminated by an electric bulb. With a finger at the
switch Benedict's wife pointed to Clifton's dunnage-pack, and as he
took it in his hands they were in darkness again. In the gloom she
unbolted a narrow door and a silvery glow of stars and moon lighted
up her white dress and golden hair.</p>

<p>Her eyes were strangely bright as they stood for a moment in the
light. Voices came to them faintly as Benedict played for time
above.</p>

<p>And in this moment Clifton felt creeping over him a sense of
humiliation and shame.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he whispered. "That is all I can ask&mdash;and
more than I can expect in return for the evil which I tried to do
you. But I didn't understand. It was because I loved Benedict. And
I thought you&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," she interrupted him, and her hand pressed his softly.
"I understand. You thought I would bring him unhappiness. When I do
that&mdash;I want to die."</p>

<p>"You will care for Joe&mdash;for a little while?"</p>

<p>"This is Joe's home, and yours whenever you care to return to
it."</p>

<p>He fitted the pack to his shoulders.</p>

<p>She seemed taller when he said good-by. Her eyes were very
bright and steady, and he thought that even in these moments of
uncertainty and thrill a smile trembled on her lips.</p>

<p>Her voice had in it an odd ring of triumph as she partly closed
the door behind him.</p>

<p>"I forgive you, and I pity you," she whispered after him. "You
need a wife, just as poor, dear Benedict needed one. Women are
different today, you know, and they don't sit around any more
weeping and praying for what they want. They get up and go after
it&mdash;and especially the bobbed-haired ones. And some day I hope
another Simla widow will see you, Clifton, and want you, and go
after you, and get you, and I pray&mdash;oh, yes, I pray dear God
that she will have bobbed hair!"</p>

<p>And the door closed behind him, and he heard a little laugh from
behind it, and then he walked up and straight out through the
moonlight into the cool deep shadows of the trees between him and
the freedom of the wide highway.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>Where that freedom lay Clifton paused. It did not lure him out
of the shadows. The last tinkling laugh of the Simla widow&mdash;of
Clairette Aldous&mdash;remained softly in his ears, and he felt
like a coward running away from a humiliation as great as that
which he had inflicted upon Ivan Hurd. He knew it had come from her
heart, and its very triumph so gentle that it bore no note of
malice or exultation pressed upon him now what seemed to be his own
littleness and degradation. He had come triumphant; he was going
away whipped&mdash;unmercifully impaled upon his own folly. And he
knew he deserved it.</p>

<p>He concealed himself in a break in the thick hedge and faced the
ch&acirc;teau. The door was open and he could hear voices. A little
distance away he could see the motor-car. A figure was pacing up
and down beside it and the moonlight revealed two others in it. He
guessed that one of them was Hurd.</p>

<p>Benedict's drawling voice came to him. Another moment a little
shiver ran through him as he heard Clairette's. It was like a sharp
little barb striking him in a tender spot, for he knew what she was
saying. She was covering his flight. She was directing the twin
batteries of her prettiness and ingenuous na&iuml;vet&eacute; upon
the officers that he might get safely away.</p>

<p>He saw them come out through the door, the Simla widow talking
so fast that Benedict was subdued; their feet crunched in the white
gravel; he could see the moonlight glinting in her hair, and he
heard her say good night, and saw Benedict strike a match to light
a cigaret, and watched the officers as they stalked down the path
on their return to the car. Then the ch&acirc;teau door closed with
a defiant and aggressive slam.</p>

<p>It was over. She had fought for him instead of giving him up to
the punishment he deserved. His face had been hot, now it cooled.
He smiled in the darkness of his hiding-place and a little grimly
at first his old humor returned. He thanked God she was like
that.</p>

<p>Lovable old Bones deserved a woman like her&mdash;the best in
the world. But what an ass he had made of himself those weeks in
the Simla Hills!</p>

<p>A voice growled angrily from the car. It was Hurd's. There
followed a consultation which lasted several minutes. Then the
motor began to purr, but not before two figures had detached
themselves from it, one entering the grounds and the other
disappearing in the deep gloom of the avenue trees. Hurd had
suspicions, if not convictions. The place was under
surveillance.</p>

<p>Even at that Clifton was sure he could regain entrance into the
ch&acirc;teau unobserved. But the desire to go back, though it was
warm in his heart, did not move him in that direction. He
considered himself a good riddance. So he kept to the shadows and
stole to the east with much the same caution with which he and
Benedict had left the mud huts on the Irawadi in the younger days
of their adventuring.</p>

<p>For a long time after that he gave little attention to his
progress except that he traveled a street which ran parallel with
Sherbrooke and kept as much as possible in shadow. He had no motive
or destination in mind. He was simply getting away from something
in an entirely unplanned and desultory kind of way, and only the
habit of his last few days of journeying kept him facing the east.
Never in the memories of his adventuring had such a complexity of
happenings fallen upon him as tonight, and he was still dazed by
their unexpectedness and even more upset by the unaccountable
emotions which they had stirred within him. Since five o'clock his
world had been shaken in a bag.</p>

<p>He was surprised when he reached the borderland of the city.
Time had passed swiftly, he had walked fast, and a sea of electric
glow lay behind him. Life was obliterating itself in a pall of
darkness mellowed by star-glow. The moon was hidden beyond the
forested crest of Mount Royal and the stillness of Canadian
midnight gathered about darkened homes which had thinned from
packed-in city dweller to suburbanite, and now to the less tenanted
country of the still more fortunate.</p>

<p>Clifton threw back his shoulders and drank in the air deeply as
he looked up at a million stars. Such as these were his hours of
happiness, with the free earth under his feet and all the world to
swing his arms in. He was traveling a dirt road that was soft and
springy. The paved trail was farther south.</p>

<p>His anxieties melted away and questionings ceased. In their
place came a pleasanter contemplation of what to him had been a
series of interesting phenomena. He granted the possibility of
unusual psychical happenings, and he seldom traveled alone even
when to all appearance he was physically in utter isolation. It was
then that life and comradeship drew nearer him and he felt himself
gathered into a fraternalism so vast that it filled other universes
besides his own.</p>

<p>He believed that to the human soul anything was conceivable once
it understood the significance of space, and that somewhere among a
billion other worlds and suns and solar systems the greater things
in soul-progression were being enacted. And so, partly from a drop
of blood that was inherited from the forests and partly from an
understanding that was clearer than most men's he did not laugh at
miracles and dreams any more than he accepted them as messages to
be translated and obeyed. It was their mystery that interested him.
For which reason, as he went on through the starlight, his thoughts
returned to the old Indian cemetery at Brantford Town and the
visions that had come to him there.</p>

<p>It occurred to him that the ghost of the peace-loving young
Seneca chieftain might have been right and that he should have left
the hatchet buried instead of stirring up all this mess with Hurd.
But there had been his mother and Brant and all the warriors to
urge him on in the decision which he had already made. He tried to
beat around the bush by revisioning only those parts of the dream
in which the young girl did not appear. But she broke in at last,
and Clifton laughed as he confessed his own weakness and admitted
that his mind had gone back to the cemetery especially on account
of her.</p>

<p>There was about her much that reminded him of the girl in Hurd's
room. She had laughed, she had run away from him, she had been
completely elusive and mysterious. So was the girl who had warned
him. Both were without a solution that he could think of, and a
superstitious person might have fancied things and worked himself
up into a curious mental state of hypothesis and conjecture,
especially as one girl had knelt at his mother's feet and the other
had saved him from his enemies; but as for himself, possessing both
sanity and an unexcitable temperament&mdash;</p>

<p>"Neither of which I've got," he broke in on himself. "I'm an
ass, and always have been!"</p>

<p>Relieved by this burden of confession he stood straighter,
walked faster, and began to whistle.</p>

<p>In the cool of night, with a soft road under his feet, he was
tireless. The hours and miles fell behind him and the glow of
Montreal faded until it was a pale nimbus almost lost in the light
of the stars. And now, in that hour of miracle and stillness that
just precedes dawn, and with the city fifteen miles behind him, he
knew that he had come into the heart of the country of
L'Assomption&mdash;and the French habitant.</p>

<p>Here he was entering the edge of life as it had been lived
nearly three centuries ago, and he looked ahead through the miles
and days that would lead him deeper into this land that he loved,
with its freedom and its illimitable space, its romance and its
tragedy, and above all else its priceless heritage of a people
untouched through twelve generations by the mad progress of the
swift-moving civilization that shut it in&mdash;New France three
hundred years ago, still New France today; assimilating instead of
surrendering itself to the inroads of invasion, as true to itself
as in the days when Cartier and Champlain and Frontenac first came
that way, and to Clifton the one hidden-away paradise in the
world.</p>

<p>He knew that he had passed through but the first door of Old
Quebec, yet even here, with one of the world's great cities less
than a score of miles behind him, all its welcome swept upon him.
He passed the sleeping habitant farms, with their barns built close
to the road and their homes sometimes unseen. Here a cross and
there a sheltered shrine rose in the starlight ahead of him, and
always the figure of the Christ with His crown of thorns looked
down at him as he passed them. The wayside churches with their
doors that were never locked cheered him with the gossamer glow of
burning candles and invited him to rest if he was tired.</p>

<p>Slumbering villages grew up like shadows in his path, and about
him, it seemed, were remnants of the forests of the earliest
pioneers, with oaks so great that they must have looked down on the
first cavaliers and seigneurs who followed the trails of the Jesuit
fathers, and maples that spread their arms over the road to form
long aisles and pools of deepest gloom.</p>

<p>He paused at the top of a hill and from there he looked down
both ways on the ancient highway. And behind him he could still
faintly see Montreal. It was many years since he had last stood on
this hill, and then the little old gray priest of St. Lin had stood
at his side and had drawn pictures for him of the days when these
wooded hills and green meadowlands had witnessed the making of the
first and most terrible of all the blood-written pages of history
in a new world.</p>

<p>He had never forgotten little Father Arnaud of St. Lin, who
would rather have died a martyr like Chaumonot and De
Br&eacute;beuf than to have lived in these days of peace. And the
visions and pictures came to him again as he stood looking back at
the dying glow of a great city, and he tried to fancy that he
heard&mdash;as Father Arnaud with his strange, restless mind had
heard until the day of his death&mdash;the footsteps and voices of
those who had come centuries before to conquer or die.</p>

<p>In this dust under his feet and in this greensward at his side
had traveled the feet of Cartier and Champlain and Joliet and
Frontenac. Pierre Radisson, the greatest adventurer of them all,
had looked down from this hill, and it may be that the great oak at
its crest had shaded Tonty and La Salle; and it was here, the
priest of St. Lin had told him, that the Iroquois had tortured
Fathers De Br&eacute;beuf and Lallemant, plucking their fingers and
their nails and tearing out their tongues and at the end of two
days of torture pouring boiling water on their heads in imitation
of baptism.</p>

<p>And as these priests had died so had others died in this
amphitheater whose heart was now the glow of a city. Here the
Jesuits had come to offer up their bodies on the sacrificial altar
of martyrdom, just as little old Father Arnaud would have done in
the same day&mdash;Father Daniel who had smiled his forgiveness as
the Iroquois arrows killed him; Father Joseph Bressani, who lived
through a month of tortures; Fathers Gamier and Chabanel and
Jogues, who died at the stake&mdash;and scores of others who, the
little old priest of St. Lin had declared, gave up their lives in
horrible torture that the modern city of Montreal might have its
God.</p>

<p>To Clifton, in his aloneness, there rose up much of the majesty
and awesomeness of those years that were gone, and for a moment he
fancied the dying glow of the distant city was made by the flaming
homes of old Lachine, and that if he listened hard enough he might
hear the triumphant yells of the Mohawks, the Oneidas and the
Senecas as they turned the valley red with fire and blood. And
suddenly it was the barking of a dog that roused him from his
dreaming, and he went down the hill and noticed that the east was
beginning to break with dawn.</p>

<p>This, at last, was the beginning of his homecoming, for there
was less of grief here than in the boyhood memories of Brantford
Town, and more of hope, and with it the thrilling nearness of that
God's country which had claimed him when his body and soul were in
the making. A little ahead of him lay the city of old Quebec, and
beyond that the vastness of the Laurentian forests, and the great
rivers that roared like lions out of the unmapped mysteries of the
Upper Lands, and countless lakes shut in by their walls of primeval
grandeur&mdash;and a people who regarded the English-speaking race
as foreigners.</p>

<p>It was there he would find the trails blazed by his father and
himself&mdash;half a century ago, it seemed to him. He felt himself
touched suddenly by the spirit of a joyous adventuring, as it must
have touched those others in days when the dust under his feet was
a winding path in the wilderness. And then he laughed softly for
calling himself an adventurer in a land that was gray with age, yet
knowing that it was this very remoteness of its birth and the
ancient ghosts that peopled it which gave him the thrill that would
never die as long as he lived to vision its pictures under the
fading stars.</p>

<p>He came to a stream which was the Achigan, and struck out from
the road into the edge of a woodland where a monarchy of
century-old elms and oaks reared their heads in a canopy that shut
out what was left of the starlight, and here he spread his blanket
and prepared to sleep. Fragrance of flowers filled the woods and
the breath of earth and green foliage was like a delicate musk in
the air, and as drowsiness stole over him he thought of Hurd, and
of the police watching the ch&acirc;teau grounds, and he wondered
if Benedict and the Simla widow were sleeping as soundly as he was
going to sleep for hours to come, and if the mystery girl who had
warned him was at home and in bed&mdash;as it was highly proper she
should be.</p>

<p>A queer mess he had fallen into, he meditated, but he was out of
it now; he chuckled drowsily as he thought a last time of the
foolish disturbance he had made. Tomorrow he would write a letter
to Benedict and his wife and another to Joe. He wished that Joe
were with him, for he missed the little beggar&mdash;and Bim. Maybe
he would have them come to Quebec later on. These two were last in
his mind when he fell asleep.</p>

<p>The world began to rouse itself soon after that. Roosters
stretched their necks and crowed while it was still dark. In the
little homes with their vivid colorings of red and green and yellow
paint the wicks of low-burning lamps were turned higher,
multiplying their reflections on snow-white, naked floors and the
polished nickel-work and spotless mirrors of the splendid
cook-stove which was the grand piano and ultimate ambition of every
habitant home. The clink of milk pails came from cool cellarettes
built in the earth, and one dog answered another half a mile away,
and birds fluffed themselves into wakefulness in the thickets, and
with the first streaks of dawn the crows began cawing over the hay
fields.</p>

<p>Even here, so near to the great city that its whistles sent
faint echoes over the land on still days, there was no wakening
bedlam of automobile or trailing blanket of dust stirred up by
early travelers. A cool, sweet moisture dwelt in the purity of the
air, waiting for the sun; it covered the earth with a shimmering
mist and hung in tiny shining pendants from petaled flowers and the
ends of thick, rich grass. Strokes of a distant ax drifted like
mellow notes in a melody of home and peace and voices called out
their morning cheer in the soft language of New France. A song
rose, where a man was building a fire in a great outside oven whose
bricks had been molded by the hands of his grandfather a hundred
years before. And the early sun broke over it all, a rose-flush
first, a crimson streak of fire, and next the glory of day
itself.</p>

<p>In the wood where Clifton slept a pair of squirrels scolded at
the monster who lay under the oak in which they had built their
summer nest, and a jay screamed down to help them. But above their
excitement rose the melody that was always like a benediction
coming out of the forest to greet the summer sun, the voice of
thrush and robin and catbird&mdash;drab brown nightingale of the
Canada woods; of little brush-sparrows that were like silvery
flutes, of the cardinal and the golden canary, and the lark with
his winged song in the edge of the meadow&mdash;a glorious
minstrelsy which Clifton slept through, yet sensed in the
restfulness of his slumber, until the stillness of mid-forenoon lay
heavily again through the greenwood.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes then and saw the gnarled and deep-foliaged
limbs of the oak above him, and heard the droning hum of bees among
the flowers intoned with the whispering breeze in the tree tops.
The wings of the busy workers glistened in the filtered sunlight as
he sat up, and his hand rested in a mass of wood-violets that his
cheek had crushed. Sweet scent of silvery-petaled anemones and
purple trillium filled the air he breathed, and crimson wild
fox&mdash;sweeter than honey&mdash;nodded at him on long, thin
stems that grew up out of little seas of broad-leaved mandrake,
heavy with their yellow fruit.</p>

<p>It was here, amid dainty lilies-of-the-valley and star-flowers
and lady's-slippers and golden love-apples that peace must
everlastingly dwell. The thought came to him as he rose and
stretched himself, and noted the position of the sun. Here there
could be no Hurds, no police, no strife, no marring discord to
break the symphony of life. In such a place as this he had often
thought he would like to live forever.</p>

<p>And then he heard a sound that turned him with quickened ears,
and eyes that sought to penetrate the deeper aisles of the wood. It
was a strange and unusual sound. He walked toward it, leaving his
pack on the ground and the sound grew more distinct as he advanced,
as if a great flail were threshing about in some hidden thicket
ahead of him.</p>

<p>He climbed a knoll, and then came to the edge of a tiny forest
meadow, and there, looking down, he saw four men crash out from a
clump of underbrush in what appeared to be the throes of a mortal
combat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>The men were fighting. There was no doubt of that fact in
Clifton's mind. He was so near he could hear their panting breaths,
and suddenly one voice rose like the bellowing of a bull, and it
was answered by a shrill and squeaking cry from almost at Clifton's
feet.</p>

<p>He peered out from behind a concealing bush, and within reach of
his hands was a squatted figure of a composition so startling that
he swallowed his breath in amazement. The man was little and skinny
and sat with his chin in the palms of his hands regarding the
unequal battle&mdash;for Clifton had seen that one was fighting
against three in the terrific combat a dozen yards away.</p>

<p>The onlooker's bent body was clothed in worn and shiny black,
and his cadaverous face looked out from under a skull that was
shaven like a monk's. In either hand he held a small stick, and
these he waved as a bandmaster might have used his baton, keeping
time to the swift-moving events in the little meadow below him. And
as he waved his squeaking voice hurled down Latin words and phrases
and his heels kicked furrows in the soil.</p>

<p>This much Clifton saw, and turned his eyes upon the fight.</p>

<p>His blood curdled, for if he had ever looked on murder it was
happening here. The man who was fighting alone was a giant with a
great moon-face and arms that swung like beams, but each of his
three assailants was scarcely smaller, and bore down on him in a
mighty rush. As they went to earth together in a mass of straining
bodies and twisted legs and arms the yell that was like a bull's
bellow came again out of their midst, and again it was answered by
the squeaking death's-head sitting in the shade of the bush.</p>

<p>Clifton made a swift decision as he realized what was happening.
Here among the habitants&mdash;even in a three-to-one
fight&mdash;he knew there was no stand up and take, no warding of
blows or pugilistic skill, but only biting and gouging and choking
and rib-breaking, strength pitted against strength, teeth against
teeth, thumbs against thumbs&mdash;and with three hulking brutes
against one in that kind of shambles&mdash;</p>

<p>A sudden eruption in the mass of bodies stopped him as he was
about to make sudden descent, and a shriek of approbation followed
by a volley of Latin anathema came from the little man under the
bush as the moon-faced giant disentangled himself, with an arm
around the neck of one of his enemies. And then Clifton saw that it
was this moon-faced man who bellowed like a bull, for his momentary
yell of triumph made the woodland echo.</p>

<p>But it was choked in the middle by the other two, and down they
went again in a scramble of horror, and this time only the lone
fighter's heels remained above the melee. Heroically the
monk-headed figure under the bush swung his sticks and screeched
his encouragement, but the moon-faced man gave no answer, and the
heels remained mutely where they were, and <i>ba'tams</i> and
French oaths of greater quality rose from the triumphant three as
they bit and gouged and tore at their victim, while a
yellow-throated warbler split his throat in song near the scene of
battle.</p>

<p>In another moment Clifton had leaped from his concealment and
was close to the fighters. He saw that the ground was torn up as if
pigs had been rooting it, and shredded bits of clothing were
scattered about, and his toe kicked up a handful of brick-red hair.
It was apparent that the bloody debate had been progressing for
some time, and now, if he was any judge at all in such matter, it
had almost reached a termination. The moon-faced man's legs
continued to wave and kick in the air, and Clifton guessed it was
his voice that came in muffled snorts and groans and bellows from
underneath, but outside those manifestations of life he seemed to
be done for. And his complete demise seemed imminent when one of
the swearing Frenchmen dug himself out and with both arms pinioned
the struggling legs, bent them back, and with a howl of triumph
sunk his teeth in the moon-faced man's shank where a ripped trouser
leg left it white and naked.</p>

<p>Clifton struck out and the Frenchman let go his hold. He swayed
to his feet, mystified by the blow, and Clifton knocked him down so
efficiently that he rolled over on his stomach and remained quiet.
Then he seized a brick-red head and dragged a pair of huge
shoulders after it and swatted their owner with both fists until
the moon-faced man was left with only one assailant. For several
minutes after that Clifton found himself with his hands full, until
a lucky blow in the pit of the red-headed man's stomach laid him
out beside his countryman. The moon-faced individual, staring at
him through blood and dirt, sat astride the third man's body with
his huge thumbs fastened at the nape of his neck ready to give him
the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> if he dared to move. From that
position he looked his amazement at Clifton.</p>

<p>Now that the peace of victory seemed to have descended upon the
land the death's-head figure under the bush scrambled to his feet
and hopped like a cricket to the edge of the arena.</p>

<p>"By the blessed St. Peter but that was a timely interruption!"
he cackled joyously in French. "It was sweet manna for one who is
frail in body yet strong in spirit, Monsieur, the lustihood of a
seasonable David smiting an accursed Goliath, of a strong arm among
the Philistines, of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" panted the moon-faced man as he swallowed a great
lump in his throat. "Do you dare intimate I would not have wrecked
these three with my own two hands, and without help of man or God,
if this interloper had not spoiled my plans just as they were about
to take form? What difference does it make to Gaspard St. Ives
whether there be three or twenty! I've a notion to rattle your
bones&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," interrupted the little man, dropping his sticks and
rubbing his hands gleefully. "If I never have a full belly again
you were done for this time, dear Gaspard! Only your heels were
alive when the good St. Michael who delivers us from our enemies
sent this friend of ours. Thank him, Gaspard. Rise like a gentleman
and thank him!"</p>

<p>"<i>Ba'tam</i>, I say!"</p>

<p>"You would have had no ears in another two minutes, friend
Gaspard."</p>

<p>"I would have thrown them off!"</p>

<p>"They were eating you alive. Even those great heels of yours
were growing weak. Thank the gentleman, Gaspard, before he thinks
you are bedeviled and an imbecile! Only the grace of God keeps me
from doing it, for the words should come from your mouth."</p>

<p>With a huge grunt the moon-faced man rose from his enemy. He was
stripped to the waist, and his immense body was stained with blood
and dirt. One of his ears bore the marks of teeth, his neck was red
from choking, and his left eye was closing.</p>

<p>"I am Gaspard, brother of Antoinette St. Ives, and if you did me
a favor&mdash;which I doubt&mdash;I thank you," he said, in as good
French as Clifton had ever heard in the province of Quebec. "And
this little parcel of bones with the shaven head is Friar Alphonse,
a back-sliding monk from the Trappist monastery of Mistassini at
the head of Lake Saint John. If he says I cannot whip these three,
or any other three men in Quebec, all at once and
together&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am sorry that I interfered," said Clifton, smiling, and
holding out a hand. "I can see now that they were almost spent. I
am sure you would have finished them in the end."</p>

<p>The giant's round, smooth face with its mop of unruly blond hair
grew clouded.</p>

<p>"You mean that?" he asked a bit dubiously. "Had I a chance,
think you, Monsieur, with one of them at my throat, another with
his teeth in my ear, and a third tearing like an angry dog at my
shank? Were they weak when you put those two out&mdash;like
that?"</p>

<p>"They were weak as children," said Clifton.</p>

<p>"He lies like a man without conscience," rasped the little
monk.</p>

<p>And suddenly, without warning, St. Ives put his hands on his
hips, threw back his head and roared with laughter. Then he seized
Clifton's hand and near broke it in the heartiness of his
clasp.</p>

<p>"No brother could love you more than I!" he cried. "You are a
man of honor who will lie for a cause, and what better can there be
than that? I was trained for the priesthood, Monsieur, but being of
free mind and open disposition I loved fighting better, and know
enough of it to guess that sweet Antoinette St. Ives would not have
recognized her brother a week hence had you not interfered; and as
for Angelique Fanchon, next prettiest to my sister of all women in
the Province of Quebec, and who will not marry me because I do not
love pigs and cows and a farm&mdash;why, the sight of me would have
turned her gentle soul against me forever! <i>Ba'tam</i>, I thank
you again, Monsieur!"</p>

<p>His French rolled out in a mellow cadence, and all at once
Clifton felt a great liking for the man.</p>

<p>The other three men were pulling themselves together as St. Ives
dusted himself and gathered up his clothes. Two of them sat up and
one raised himself on an elbow, and smiling and nodding at them in
a friendly fashion Clifton saw that Gaspard had given a magnificent
account of himself. His enemies were in tatters and their faces
were bruised and bleeding. One's nose was still running red,
another's ear was streaming where Gaspard's teeth had got a good
hold of it, and a third was blinking out of eyes almost shut. There
was no more fight in them and they uttered no word as St. Ives led
the way up over the knoll toward the river beside which Clifton had
slept. Clifton explained the presence of his pack when they came to
it, and how he had wakened to the sound of battle.</p>

<p>"You could hear it?" asked Gaspard with pride, as he stripped
himself for a plunge. "It was that violent, you say?"</p>

<p>"It was your bull voice he heard howling with torment," chuckled
Friar Alphonse. "Never did I hear a yell like yours when that
red-headed disciple of the Devil had his teeth in your ear!"</p>

<p>Gaspard rumbled in his deep chest.</p>

<p>"What was the cause of the misunderstanding?" asked Clifton,
loading his pipe.</p>

<p>"Pretty women and a liar, friend," grunted Gaspard. "The liar is
this worthless rattle of bones Alphonse who tells tales that would
hang him in perdition. To maintain my dignity while traveling in
his company I am compelled to fight when people tell him what a
dissembler and hypocrite he is. He perjures and bears false witness
and therefore I have trouble."</p>

<p>"Yet my story was truth," averred the little monk, rubbing his
hands as if to warm them. "I did set that hen on forty turtle eggs,
and the turtles were hatched, and the hen did go crazy as I
described; and in that other story the wolves did tree me, just as
I set forth, and as they dug up one tree by the roots I jumped into
another, and so kept them digging up trees all night, until I had a
little clearing all ready for a cabin, with no work on my part but
climbing from tree to tree as they fell. And as for the pet
muskellunge, which followed me for days in the water, and into
whose nose I strung a ring carrying the Holy Family&mdash;Jesus,
Mary and Joseph&mdash;all brought from the sacred font at Sainte
Anne de Beaupr&eacute;, and in little forms of pewter neatly done
in a box&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" growled Gaspard.</p>

<p>His great body plunged into the stream.</p>

<p>"It was more the women than my stories, I assure you," confided
Alphonse as his big friend disappeared under the water. "Wherever
we meet in sociable discourse with village strangers he never
misses the opportunity to tell them that the two most beautiful
women in the world belong to him, his sister and the sweetheart who
refuses to marry him until he settles down from his deviltry and
becomes a farmer. I travel with him because I love him and hope
some day to bring his soul to salvation.</p>

<p>"His sister and his sweetheart, and not the truthful tales which
I occasionally relate, were the cause of our trouble at the
neighborhood dance last night, for there were other swains present
who, under the influence of strong beer, resented his boasts; and
so it happened that he offered to fight the three strongest men in
the Assomption country, come all at a time, and because he stood
with his arm about the girls' waists between dances it was no
difficult matter to arrange the meeting for this morning in the
wood. It is true some of them did call me a liar because of my
stories, but it was Gaspard's pretty sister and the sweetheart who
won't have him that started the trouble. I swear it by sweet Sainte
Pauline, who died of a most horrible toothache in a wood just like
this!"</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, and his hands grew quiet as he
looked at St. Ives plunging about like a great porpoise in the
river.</p>

<p>"And she is the prettiest and sweetest girl in all Quebec," he
said musingly. "In that he is right. I mean his sister, Antoinette
St. Ives. And how she worships this overgrown son of Satan who
ambles about like a cock always in search of a new dunghill to
conquer!"</p>

<p>Clifton bent over his pack to hide his amusement, but the next
words of the talkative little monk put something besides laughter
into his heart and took the smile from his lips.</p>

<p>"And when this trouble occurred we were just beginning our way
homeward from that monstrous city behind us, where the Devil abides
in all his glory&mdash;and where Antoinette St. Ives, who comes of
the ancient blood of Martin and Herbert and Marrolet and all those
others who have their names on the stone monument in Quebec City,
has gone to see an unblessed limb of that same Devil named Ivan
Hurd. Why, friend stranger, for you have not yet confided in us
your name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she has&mdash;a voice&mdash;" began Clifton, before
he could stop himself.</p>

<p>"Of a certainty she has a voice, brother. Would you have it
otherwise? And she sings like a golden warbler at the beginning of
the love season. But look at that gross pig coming out of his
wallow&mdash;I mean Gaspard St. Ives! How can any beast love him,
much less a woman?"</p>

<p>"Yet you said that you had love for him."</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"Then why did you not help him in the fight?"</p>

<p>The little monk looked up with a grimace.</p>

<p>"Help him&mdash;<i>in a fight</i>? <i>Maudit</i>, you are the
first man who ever did it and suffered no penalty afterward.
Gaspard will have no help in a fight, even though he die in it. I
helped him once, twice, three times&mdash;and that is why my bones
are so loosely jointed now, because of the shakings he gave me. And
so I sit and look on, and call upon all the sixty saints in my
calendar, and pound our enemies with Latin, and count my beads and
pray&mdash;and never in single combat, or even double, have we
failed to win. Yet this three against one is sinful and against all
the rules of common sense. But I would not have interfered a fourth
time&mdash;not I!"</p>

<p>St. Ives had come out of the river, his smooth white skin adrip
with water, and never had Clifton seen a better made body or
muscles. It was the round, moon-like face of the man, wide between
the eyes, fresh as a girl's in its color and topped by a riot of
sunny hair that took away from the dramatic possibilities of him.
Clifton would have judged him a peace-loving soul quicker to pray
than to fight.</p>

<p>"I have a towel in my pack," he said. "May I lend it to
you?"</p>

<p>"If you will, Monsieur. And you, Alphonse, go make our own
things ready while I dress."</p>

<p>The monk drew away into the edge of the wood and Gaspard
scrubbed himself with Clifton's towel.</p>

<p>"You must not give much account to Friar Alphonse's talk," he
explained, pausing in his labor to give point to his words. "For
years he was a Cistercian, in other words a Trappist monk. Then one
day a tree fell on him and so cracked his head that it let in a
little common sense&mdash;God forgive me my own weakness!&mdash;and
from then on he has traveled the roads, talking all the time to
make up for lost years.</p>

<p>"I keep him with me because I love him in spite of the accursed
rattle of his bones and tongue, and because that twisted back of
his&mdash;it is slight, but you may have noticed it&mdash;was
caused by a beating among the rocks which he received one day years
ago in the Mistassini when he saved my sister from drowning. So he
may lie if it gives him pleasure&mdash;and there never was a
greater liar born!&mdash;and I will continue to fight for him, come
one come all, and break with my hands whoever dares to give voice
to that truth that he is a liar. And so, because his words and his
tales are the most unbelievable in the world, he is a constant
brewer of trouble, and keeps me in good form as you have witnessed,
Monsieur&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Brant&mdash;Clifton Brant," nodded Clifton as the other waited
for his name. "I am on my way to my old tramping grounds, the
Saguenay, Chicoutimi, Metabetchewan, Lake Saint John and all the
great rivers north."</p>

<p>Gaspard paused in his dressing and looked at Clifton. Then he
stretched out two great hands in a new grip of fellowship.</p>

<p>"I knew it," he cried joyously. "I knew it by the little twists
of your French and the way you spit. No other in the world can spit
like a Metabetchewan man or a Lake Saint Johner! And I have seen
you do it twice, Friend Clifton&mdash;twice&mdash;once when you hit
a lily-of-the-valley squarely in the eye at a good six paces, and
again when you shot over that log into the edge of the stream!
We'll go on together, for I'm a Lake Saint John's man myself and
it's on the streams of the north I live. <i>Sacr&eacute;</i>, but
this is luck!"</p>

<p>They left the river and found Alphonse with a big pack ready
where he and Gaspard had slept in the wood not far from the place
Clifton had chosen in the early dawn. Then the three crossed a
green meadow to the highway.</p>

<p>Only half attention had Clifton paid to most of the talk since
the derelict monk had dropped the extraordinary information that
the sister of this moon-faced fighter whose ally he had become was
associated in some way with Ivan Hurd.</p>

<p>It seemed, as he passed the circumstance over in his mind, that
Fate was dogging his footsteps with a most unusual and complicated
set of events. That it might have been Gaspard's sister who was
concealed in Hurd's rest room during the struggle in his office had
been his first thought. There was something about the name of
Antoinette St. Ives that touched his imagination instantly,
especially as he had witnessed the fighting qualities of her
adventurous brother. If St. Ives had the nerve to tackle three men
at a time it was surely reasonable to presume that his sister would
not be afraid to laugh at Ivan Hurd.</p>

<p>But he kept back the question which several times had come to
the end of his tongue. His curiosity, he believed, was getting the
better of his sound judgment. Yet he said casually, as he walked
between Gaspard and the monk: "It is strange that your sister knows
this Ivan Hurd in Montreal, St. Ives. It is a long way from the
country of Saint John, or even old Quebec for that matter."</p>

<p>Alphonse opened conversation with a curious click of his teeth,
and scarce had this click sounded, giving notice of words about to
follow, when St. Ives reached behind Clifton and caught the monk's
arm in a grip that wrenched a grunt of pain from his bony comrade.
In the same moment Clifton caught a swift change in the blond
giant's face. It hardened in an instant and a warning flash of fire
was in his eyes as he looked at Alphonse.</p>

<p>Then he laughed, and sunshine leaped back into his countenance
again.</p>

<p>"It is hard, Monsieur, with a sister in Montreal and a
sweetheart in that paradise valley at Saint F&eacute;licien, where
I should be raising pigs and cattle and high-stepping horses if I
were not a fool. It is sometimes hard to tell which pulls the
strongest. If you could see my sister, and then Angelique, you
would know what it means to be between the Devil and the sea."</p>

<p>"I already know," said Clifton with a careless laugh, as if he
had not seen the change in his companion's face.</p>

<p>"A love affair, <i>ami</i>?"</p>

<p>The little monk interrupted with a contemptuous cackle that was
half sneer and half laugh, and at the same time drew himself a safe
distance from St. Ives.</p>

<p>"What fools women make of strong men!" he exclaimed. "Why don't
you tell our friend the truth, Gaspard&mdash;that this black-eyed
wench of an Angelique whom you call your sweetheart has wrecked
your heart into a jelly, put water into your soul and turned you
out on the highways half a lunatic&mdash;and not entirely because
you won't turn farmer&mdash;but because her eyes are filled with a
form even mightier than your own, none other than that of Ajax
Trappier, who owns seven hundred arpents of grassy valley, a
thousand head of stock, the fastest horses about Saint
F&eacute;licien&mdash;and two legs, a body and a set of teeth of
which I verily believe you are mortally afraid. Tell him all that,
Gaspard, and you will tell the truth!"</p>

<p>The pink left Gaspard's face and gave place to white.</p>

<p>"It is true this Ajax Trappier is trying to buy her with his
wealth," he said bitterly, "and when the humor comes to me I will
crush him like an egg-shell for his villainy."</p>

<p>He paused in the road to lengthen a strap on his pack, and
Alphonse had opportunity to whisper: "That is a weak spot I hit him
in, and I must keep it up to get action. It is the only way to
drive him back to Angelique, who truly loves him, and who uses this
big fool Trappier only as a foil to work out her ends. If St. Ives
will only go back and whip Ajax, and settle down, and become the
respectable and God-fearing farmer that Angelique is praying
for&mdash;by Sainte Marguerite what happiness and children there
will be!"</p>

<p>He fell into a thoughtful silence which was not broken for many
miles, and Clifton found that when the little monk was in this
mood, and walked with bent head some distance behind them, St. Ives
held his banter in leash and made no effort to rouse him either
with serious talk or joking.</p>

<p>It was noon before they came to a village where they stopped for
their morning and midday meals combined, and when this dinner was
over St. Ives excused himself mysteriously and said he would return
in half an hour.</p>

<p>Food and drink had put Alphonse in happy humor, and his thin
face cracked with a smile as his eyes followed Gaspard's broad back
until it disappeared.</p>

<p>"So long as there is a telephone and he has a penny in his
pocket he will call up his sister," he said, and there was a
gentleness in his voice which Clifton had not heard before. "They
are all that is left to each other of what was once a great family
in New France, and their devotion is like that of sweethearts
rather than brother and sister. Abraham Martin, one of those forty
first settlers of Quebec, whose name is on the big monument in the
square, and after whom the Plains of Abraham were named, was their
forefather; and the blood of the Marrolets and the Piverts is in
their veins, so that&mdash;if it were two hundred years
ago&mdash;Gaspard St. Ives would be wearing fine lace at his
sleeves and carrying a rapier instead of a pack, and his sister
would be the sweetest and most beautiful lady in the land.</p>

<p>"It's the spirit of the old days that moves them still,
Monsieur. And like two children clinging to their dreams they hold
to that ancient and ghost-filled house in Notre Dame Street, sheer
under the rock walls of the citadel, which has come down without
change of ownership through the Marrolets and St. Ives since Crepin
Marrolet built it in sixteen hundred and seventy-two, when the
Abitation de Quebec was in Lower Town and the prettiest maids in
all the world strolled under the fortress walls instead of above
them.</p>

<p>"If you could only see this Antoinette St. Ives, whom God once
gave me grace to do slight favor, you would know that shoes of
queen or saint were intended for her little feet. If Sainte
Genevieve, whose husband went to war, had not toughened my heart
until it is like whipcord in such matters I would long ago have
died of love for her myself. Yet she will look on no man with favor
but her brother."</p>

<p>He paused for breath, then fell silent again, and after a little
rose from the table at which they were sitting and found himself a
quiet corner in which to await the return of St. Ives.</p>

<p>Clifton, alone, found himself meditating with deep interest upon
the strangeness and character of his new acquaintances. The
association of a few brief hours had made him feel that he was an
accepted part of this brotherhood of two, and an excitement of
interest was growing in him which he now made no effort to keep
down. For the first time since his adventure in Montreal he
conceded without reservation that a real thrill of concern
regarding a certain feminine human being had taken possession of
him, and the sensation was far from being unpleasant. Whether the
girl in Hurd's room and Gaspard's sister were the same or not, he
wanted to see this descendant of ancient Quebec, Antoinette St.
Ives. The name itself held him with a peculiar fascination, and
coupled as it was with a pair of adventurous and unaccountable
spirits like Gaspard and the monk its lure was one which he could
not have shaken off had he so desired.</p>

<p>He went into the street while waiting for St. Ives and its
primitive quaintness was like a forgotten song coming back to him.
It was off the main thoroughfare and here the habitant spoke his
French as he liked it, and little children shook their heads when
Clifton experimented with them by speaking words of English. And
then their white teeth flashed with sudden joyous understanding of
his playfulness when he talked to them in the tongue of their
mothers. He found himself wondering if Antoinette St. Ives was
mistress of his language as well as her own. In a vague sort of way
he hoped she knew as little of it as her brother. He loved French,
and especially this tongue mellowed by three hundred years of great
forests and streams such as no other country in the world could
boast of. And he wondered&mdash;<i>did Antoinette St. Ives have
bobbed hair</i>?</p>

<p>He bit a freshly lighted cigar half in two at that, and was
laughing when St. Ives came up the street to meet him, oblivious to
the admiring eyes of a pretty girl in a brightly colored little
balcony under which he passed.</p>

<p>He greeted Clifton stiffly, and his face had a hardness in it
that Clifton had caught a flash of before. He had little to say as
they went out of the village, with the monk trailing behind
them.</p>

<p>Half a mile down the road they came to a wayside shrine, and at
the foot of the towering cross with its life-size figure of the
bleeding Christ the big man paused and crossed himself.</p>

<p>Then he turned to Alphonse, and bared his head, and with the
look of understanding that passed between the two the giant and the
black-faced little man of God fell upon their knees in the shadow
of the cross, and with a note that was both pride and bitterness in
his voice Gaspard St. Ives said:</p>

<p>"Pray, Alphonse&mdash;and pray hard&mdash;to the glory of
Antoinette St. Ives and the eternal damnation of Ivan Hurd!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>The prayer that followed was a greater shock to Clifton than the
command of St. Ives and his astounding revealment of Ivan Hurd's
name in an undoubted moment of stress.</p>

<p>The monk began softly, his voice rising scarcely above a
whisper, but with each moment it increased in volume until it was
no longer cracked and rasping but filled with a weird melody of
passion and intensity that would have filled cathedral walls.</p>

<p>In his amazement Clifton stood without movement and stared at
the kneeling figures as the bitterness of excoriation fell like
withering red-hot lead from the lips of the little man who looked
up with clasped hands and bared head at the crucified Christ. All
the plagues and devils of earth and hell he called down upon Ivan
Hurd, and from one saint to another he skipped with amazing
swiftness, calling upon each with eloquent entreaty to smite the
object of his flaying right and left, to strike him deaf and dumb,
to blast him with lightning, boil him in oil and deliver his eyes
for hungry crows to torture.</p>

<p>And St. Ives nodded his great blond head and rolled his eyes
heavenward and the monk's thin face and shiny pate grew damp with
sweat as the sun beat down on them in the climax of his prayer.
Then came the sharp click of his teeth, like an exclamation point
at the end, and the two crossed themselves and rose.</p>

<p>To Clifton's further amazement the hardness was gone from St.
Ives's face and Alphonse chuckled and rubbed his hands together as
he looked at him.</p>

<p>"Was that sufficient, Friend Gaspard?"</p>

<p>"It was well done, Alphonse."</p>

<p>"Did I pickle him to your satisfaction?"</p>

<p>"None could have done it better."</p>

<p>"If you wish me to give him another broadside, kneeling in the
shade of that tree to give me better wind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, it is enough."</p>

<p>Clifton addressed the monk.</p>

<p>"What is the reason for that prayer?" he asked bluntly. "I would
like to know."</p>

<p>"So would I, Monsieur, now that it is finished. I know as little
of the reason for it as you, except that my friend Gaspard asked me
to send to perdition a certain individual whom he evidently has
little love for. And&mdash;St. Peter!&mdash;I forgot to offer up a
word to the glory of our Antoinette!"</p>

<p>"She will do well enough without," said St. Ives.</p>

<p>Then he fell in at Clifton's side and set a good pace along the
highway.</p>

<p>"I feel like a new man," he explained. "Whenever the Devil gets
hold of me I hand my job of praying over to Alphonse and he lifts
me out of the blues in a hurry. Did you ever hear better than that?
It would have taken a week of swearing for me to have accomplished
what Alphonse did so neatly in less than five minutes."</p>

<p>But Clifton knew that deep down in this unusual man a fire was
burning of which he made no disclosure, and glancing from St. Ives
to the monk he saw there a pair of clenched hands and a face that
was set and pale; and with these discoveries came a sudden and
decisive realization that it was not their intention to let him
become more than a passing companion of the highway or read what
they were hiding in their hearts. Of their comradeship and good
cheer they gave without end, but in the depths of these
men&mdash;and he guessed it for the first time&mdash;was something
more than mere love of adventurous vagabondage and the freedom of
the roads.</p>

<p>In the monk he was beginning to detect an undercurrent of
shrewdness and deep thought which at times betrayed itself in an
undeniable way, and in the poise of Gaspard St. Ives's head and the
straightness of his eyes was the revealment of an infinitely deeper
character than he had first seen in the roistering fighter. As the
pleasant hours of their progress continued his interest in them
became greater, and he found that even Alphonse loved life and was
filled with the humor of it, though his cadaverous face was at
times the saturnine mask of a misanthrope.</p>

<p>As each hour drew them deeper into the habitant country of the
old French an even more surprising change came over St. Ives. He
spoke of the ancient seigneurs as if they had lived but yesterday,
and told Clifton the names of their holdings as they passed,
describing the charm of their old-world manners and the culture of
their time as if he had lived in it himself. He might have known
the chivalrous and gay-hearted families of Tascherau and De
Lotbini&egrave;re, Baby and Casgrain, Bouch&egrave;re Le Moyne, De
Salaberry and others whose names came to his lips so easily, for he
described the daughters of one, and the sons of another, and how
the Gentlemen of St. Sulpice became seigneurs of all the Island of
Montreal as though he had been a boon companion with them.</p>

<p>That his heart and sympathy were still with this feudal
aristocracy of the Old World transplanted to New France was
evident, for there was regret in his voice when he spoke of the act
of 1854, when the United Parliament of the Provinces of Upper and
Lower Canada did away with the powers and vast dominions of the
seigneuries of Old Quebec. His knowledge of history was amazing,
and it seemed to Clifton that every treasured act and story of the
great drama that had written itself in adventure and blood between
the cities of Montreal and Quebec must have known the hand of St.
Ives in its making.</p>

<p>Yet at no time did the man's talk have a suspicion of
boastfulness, nor did it reveal a pride in his knowledge; and the
genuineness of his courtesy and breeding could no longer be doubted
when, with all the information he gave about himself and his
country, he asked no questions of Clifton and expressed no hint or
desire to learn whence he came or the more intimate object of his
journey north.</p>

<p>That he was in the company of two of the strangest dual
characters it had ever been his fortune to meet, Clifton readily
believed, for he made up his mind that Gaspard St. Ives was a
gentleman as well as a fighter and a wanderer of the roads, and in
the warped and dried-up figure of the monk he saw at times the
fierce and inextinguishable spirit of a tortured Jesuit who had
returned to walk over his old trails again in a modern day.</p>

<p>His desire to learn more about the association of these men and
the sister of St. Ives with Ivan Hurd was uncomfortably insistent
as the afternoon lengthened. He even went so far as to remark upon
the strangeness of the fact that he himself was acquainted with
Ivan Hurd and that there were very good reasons why he regarded him
as an enemy. Immediately there followed an embarrassing moment in
which the lines about St. Ives's mouth hardened and the little monk
looked straight ahead as if he had not heard. No questions
followed, as Clifton had hoped, nor acknowledgment from either of
the twain by word or look that his information had interested
them.</p>

<p>It was after this that Clifton noticed the beginning of an
aloofness on the part of St. Ives and his comrade. It was almost a
hint of suspicion, and once or twice after that he caught the
monk's eyes fixed upon him with burning intentness as if they were
determined to eat into any secret he might have hidden away in his
soul.</p>

<p>The tension was no less when they stopped at a village for their
supper, or when they went to bed under the open sky as dusk was
beginning to thicken into darkness about them. The politeness of
St. Ives as he bade the others good night was cold and formal, and
the monk rolled himself up in his single blanket with his knees
under his chin and spoke no word after he had placed himself in
this fashion upon the sweet-smelling grass. That the souring of
their humor might possibly be ascribed to the exhaustion of the
day, Clifton at first tried to make himself believe. But that, he
told himself, was not possible in a man like St. Ives. The change
had come with the mention of his acquaintanceship with Hurd, and
behind that change, if he was not mistaken, lay a suspicion of his
motive in joining their company. Deeply puzzled he fell asleep.</p>

<p>With the beginning of another day he was half determined to ask
for an explanation, but both St. Ives and the monk seemed to have a
hint of his intention and their manner toward him and toward each
other was such that he was helplessly at a loss to find an
opportunity such as the preceding afternoon had given him.
Apparently they were as friendly as ever, but he could see they
were watchful without appearing to be, and careful of their
tongues.</p>

<p>St. Ives talked again of the country and of Quebec and of the
ancient glories and romance of the centuries-old footway they were
traveling, and once or twice he seemed to forget himself by
breaking into brief snatches of habitant song. But Clifton was
still conscious of the mysterious breach that had come between
them&mdash;until they arrived at Grande Rivi&egrave;re du Loup.</p>

<p>Here they put up at an inn for the night and St. Ives and the
monk excused themselves immediately after supper. Clifton nodded
coolly when they left him, and made up his mind that tomorrow he
would find a reason for continuing his journey alone, possibly by
delaying his departure until the others were well on their way. He
wrote a letter to Benedict and his wife and another to Joe. Then he
went into the taproom and sat down with a mug of foaming beer.</p>

<p>He was at a little table, sitting apart from half a dozen others
in the room, when the door crashed open suddenly and St. Ives came
in with Friar Alphonse at his heels. In an instant Gaspard was at
Clifton's side, his face flushed, and seized his hand.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, <i>ami</i>," he entreated in a low voice. "I should
not have been gone so long without giving you a reason for my
absence. It is poor courtesy to one who stood by me so nobly in
that hour when three devils of L'Assomption had me with my heels in
the air. But I have been talking with my sister in Montreal and I
am happy again, for she has promised to be in Quebec when I get
there and will have all the blood sausage in the great market
between the Cathedral of Saint Marie and the College of the Jesuits
bought up for me and ready for eating. If you ever had a passion
for blood sausage, Monsieur, you may know what that means! There is
nothing in this world like blood sausage for both the palate and
the digestive organs of a man."</p>

<p>"Unless it be the wild blueberries from the hills or speckled
trout from the streams of the Montmorency, to say nothing of eels
half as thick as your leg," added Friar Alphonse.</p>

<p>"Or grapes that begin to come up at this season of the year from
the Isle of Orleans," said Gaspard. "All these she will have for
us, Friend Clifton, when you come&mdash;as you must&mdash;to the
humble little place under the old guns of the citadel which we call
our castle."</p>

<p>"Your humor has changed somewhat since last night," suggested
Clifton.</p>

<p>"It has," acknowledged St. Ives. "I beg your pardon for bad
dreams and bad thoughts."</p>

<p>"It was the fight," helped Friar Alphonse, his face cracking
with the most genial smile Clifton had seen upon it. "It proves
that Gaspard was near done for. His head was unsettled, his wits
scattered and his good reasoning powers debauched by the pummeling
he got."</p>

<p>Clifton smiled in their faces. They were a remarkable pair. "And
I won't embarrass you by asking questions," he said, speaking his
thought aloud.</p>

<p>"For which I am deeply grateful," replied St. Ives, without
shifting his eyes a thousandth of an inch.</p>

<p>"I had planned to finish my journey alone."</p>

<p>"That is impossible. You must give us opportunity to do penance
for our bad disposition of today."</p>

<p>"And yesterday," added the monk.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and yesterday."</p>

<p>"I swear by St. Raphael the Good Angel of travelers that it was
a biliousness caused by the poisonous teeth and wicked thumbs of
those men of L'Assomption," averred Alphonse.</p>

<p>"Or possibly it was caused by a lack of blood sausage in your
diet," hinted Clifton.</p>

<p>The monk nodded gravely: "That, too, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Or by not having wild blueberries from the hills for breakfast,
or fat eels for dinner&mdash;or an Ivan Hurd for the victim of your
hands instead of your prayers."</p>

<p>A low laugh rumbled in St. Ives's chest.</p>

<p>"You are hard on a man when he is down, Monsieur. Shall we have
the opportunity of doing penance? Will you continue to Quebec with
us?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure."</p>

<p>It was Gaspard's fist pounding at his door that aroused him in
the early dawn. For three hours they traveled before breakfast, and
at such a pace that the little monk was trotting half the time to
keep up with them. His toughness was astonishing and both his wind
and his ability to keep his tongue wagging seemed
inexhaustible.</p>

<p>"Why are you walking?" asked Clifton of St. Ives. "If you are in
such haste to reach Quebec it seems to me you might employ to
advantage some other device more progressive than your legs."</p>

<p>St. Ives laughed and drew in a lungful of the fresh morning
air.</p>

<p>"Partly because I am one of those misfitted fools who still love
dog-carts and rockaways more than I do motor-cars and trains, but
chiefly because my sister Antoinette would disclaim me as a brother
if I did not love to walk."</p>

<p>Clifton felt a pleasing stirring in his blood.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Antoinette loves to walk?"</p>

<p>"She has walked every path and highway in Old and Upper Quebec,"
said Gaspard proudly. "Three times she has walked from Notre Dame
Street in Quebec to the upper tributaries of Lake Saint John. It is
a matter of history in our family that whenever we have the time to
walk&mdash;we never ride."</p>

<p>"Thank God that a few are left alive like that," said Clifton
devoutly. "For nine years I have been walking, and my reasons are
the same."</p>

<p>"Hospitals and graves are filled with people who never walked,
Monsieur."</p>

<p>"And hell is cluttered with their souls," piped the monk.</p>

<p>St. Ives gave Clifton a sudden fierce look.</p>

<p>"I take it you consider yourself some walker, then?"</p>

<p>"None better in this province or any other," said Clifton,
seeing the other's challenge.</p>

<p>"Straight walking, without jog-trot, ranging or toddle?"</p>

<p>"We will leave it to Friar Alphonse, if he can follow us, and
the first to break loses a wager."</p>

<p>"Our breakfasts and a round of beer at the next inn?"</p>

<p>"Done. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>St. Ives shot ahead with great strides; Clifton followed with
shorter but swifter ones, and shoulder to shoulder they stirred up
a little trail of dust in the highway. Four miles an hour increased
to five, and five to six, at which their speed reached a maximum
but continued without a break. In two or three minutes St. Ives
glanced sidewise and looked his surprise. Never had he met a man
who could walk like Clifton. Five minutes, and then ten&mdash;and
with suspicion in his voice but without a halt in his speed he
called back to the trotting monk.</p>

<p>"Are you watching his pace, Alphonse? Has he not broken
yet?"</p>

<p>"He walks as true as ever the Devil rode on a stick!" panted the
monk.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour and Gaspard was sweating, though only the
rose-flush of the sun had risen over the rim of the east. Dust
mingled with his sweat, he took off his hat to let the coolness of
the wind in his hair, and he saw Clifton loading his pipe!</p>

<p>"<i>Ba'tam</i>, has he not broken yet, Alphonse? Are you
cheating, that you may taunt me with another beating?"</p>

<p>"As sweet Sainte Anne is my witness he walks straighter than at
the beginning!" half sobbed the winded monk.</p>

<p>"And we have only begun," said Clifton softly. "Come, St. Ives,
let us hit a real man's pace. This boy's play can bring us no honor
or pride!"</p>

<p>"<i>Sacr&eacute; vierge!</i>" gasped St. Ives, and he saw
Clifton forge ahead of him an inch at a time until he was a foot in
the lead, and then two, and three, and going steadily.</p>

<p>The monk dropped behind, choking for breath, and sat himself
down in the shade of a tree. Now St. Ives could see for himself
that Clifton was not breaking. Another five minutes and he stopped,
calling out to the victor. When Clifton turned and came back
Gaspard's wide-set eyes were half popping from his head.</p>

<p>"If Antoinette could have seen this!" he exclaimed. "Monsieur,
she will not believe me when I tell her! And Alphonse&mdash;I shall
have to kill him now or he will make my life a misery until I
die!"</p>

<p>They waited until the monk came up with sagging steps, still
breathing hard. He was too far gone to make his thrusts at St. Ives
when he learned the outcome of the match. But at breakfast time,
when they had finished their meal, one might have thought that
Gaspard's defeat had wrecked his soul.</p>

<p>"It was not for him that I care," he explained to Clifton. "He
was puffed up like a bladder with his own greatness and needed to
be pricked. It is of his sister Antoinette I am thinking, and of
Angelique Fanchon, whose ears have been filled with his boasts
since they were babies&mdash;though I have my doubts that Angelique
will care, for coming this autumn I feel it in my bones she will be
the wife of Ajax Trappier."</p>

<p>"Then she will be a widow soon after," grunted St. Ives.</p>

<p>"His sister," continued Alphonse, as if he had not heard the
other, "has set this bag of wind up on a pedestal so high that
there will be nothing left but the jelly of him when he falls. And
he has fallen. He is done for. Whipped by the ragtag and bobtail of
a country dance, and now beaten by a chance comrade of the
roads&mdash;it is enough to make me weep for Antoinette and
Angelique when they hear of it!"</p>

<p>"Possibly the news may not come to their ears," suggested
Clifton.</p>

<p>"It will&mdash;just as soon as our little friend can find the
opportunity of bearing it to them," declared St. Ives. "And to rob
him of that joy I shall tell them myself!"</p>

<p>"If he had half a backbone he dreams that he has he would leave
for Saint F&eacute;licien before the month is out, Monsieur, whip
this Ajax Trappier and marry Angelique Fanchon. If you could see
her&mdash;with eyes like velvet and hair so shiny black that it
hurts to look at it in the sun, and a mouth redder than a wild
rose, and a plumpness that fills you with hunger&mdash;may Saint
Peter and Saint Paul confound me with ghosts and thunder if any man
with half a heart and an ounce of courage would not put up a fight
for her!"</p>

<p>"But why fight?" asked Clifton.</p>

<p>"Because this Ajax is the mightiest man between Saint
F&eacute;licien and the big rivers, and has spread the rumor about
that he will make Gaspard St. Ives cross his thumbs and beg for
mercy if ever the two of them meet. And Gaspard is a little nervous
about coming upon him."</p>

<p>St. Ives leaned over the table, and in his eyes was a sullen
blaze as he ignored the little monk's words and spoke directly to
Clifton.</p>

<p>"You have fought?" he asked. "You have been through the
war?"</p>

<p>Clifton nodded. "Yes."</p>

<p>"You have seen some good fights?"</p>

<p>"A few."</p>

<p>"And you are on your way north&mdash;you are going there
soon?"</p>

<p>"Very soon."</p>

<p>"Then, without going out of your way, will you honor me with
your presence at the greatest fight that will ever have been fought
in all the Lake Saint John country? I mean when I go to meet this
Ajax Trappier, sometime within the coming month?"</p>

<p>There was no humor back of his eyes. His great hands were
clenched and his mouth was set tight.</p>

<p>"If it were a hundred years ago, Monsieur, I would have killed
him for what he has said about me at Saint F&eacute;licien!"</p>

<p>Clifton thought of the years through which he had held back his
vengeance from Ivan Hurd. And he guessed that St. Ives had been
making the same kind of fight through a briefer period.</p>

<p>"If it is within the month," he said, "I will gladly join you in
any trouble you may have, St. Ives."</p>

<p>And for the first time Clifton fancied that he saw real
happiness shining in the little monk's face as they set out once
more on their journey to Quebec.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of the third day after this, with Quebec
only a few miles away, an excitement that was almost boyish began
to possess St. Ives. His blond face was flushed and his wide eyes
filled with dancing lights, and for the twentieth time he assured
Clifton that since Crepin Marrolet brought his bride to the house
in Notre Dame Street two hundred and fifty-two years ago never had
that house been more welcome to a guest than it would be to him
this night.</p>

<p>If his sister had not yet arrived from Montreal they would still
make a good time of it, with old wine and plenty of the best beer
in the province, and blood sausage in quantities to satisfy that
belly-god Apicius himself. And Clifton, he was sure, would be
interested in the old, true stories of his house that had come down
with their family through so many generations, and in which they
still lived in spite of the fact that Lower Town was now mostly
inhabited by the canaille and was picturesque with begging
children.</p>

<p>It was the glory that was gone which held them, St. Ives
impressed on Clifton. The place was filled with ghosts. Its oak was
shiny with age and the rail of its narrow stair worn smooth by the
touch of the beauty and culture of two and a half centuries ago.
Crepin, a fierce young blade of those times, had brought one of the
three most beautiful girls in Quebec to this place as his bride in
a day when his fortunes were low in the royal favor in France. And
now Gaspard's sister Antoinette, by all odds the most beautiful
girl in this decadent Quebec of today, slept in that very room
where Adelaide Marrolet first lay in happiness at the side of her
husband.</p>

<p>In that same room the sweet Adelaide had died in the third year
of their married life, just one week after she had looked on the
body of her husband, brought home dead from a duel. Antoinette
swore that she often talked with the spirit of Adelaide, and that
she was sure the young wife had poisoned herself. Others had died
in the old house, too; so many of them that it was impossible for
him to remember all their names and the stories they had to tell.
But the place was filled with the whisper and queer perfume of
ancient romance and tragedy, as if happiness and broken lives and
bits of history had been done up in musk and buried between its
walls. And there was a story, come down from sixteen hundred and
something, that the place was built over the lost bones of
Champlain. Antoinette St. Ives would tell him all about it. Gaspard
repeated that he was sorry she would not be home that night, in all
probability, but he was sure they would have an agreeable time
together.</p>

<p>His talk stirred Clifton as he had never been stirred before. It
seemed to him that a new discovery of life had come into his body,
and it warmed him with an anticipation of events to come that was
pleasanter than anything he had ever experienced. Here he had met a
man of a kind he had sometimes built in his dreams&mdash;a misfit
of the age, as he called himself, a dreamer, one whose thoughts
brought into the present something of the idealism and glory and
thrill of a wonderful past&mdash;a man who would live in the
shambles of old stone because of the associations through which
those stones had lived. And there was a woman in the world who was
like him&mdash;his sister!</p>

<p>They approached the city by way of Sainte Foy Road and crossed
to Saint Louis Road, passing Wolfe's Field and the battle-ground of
Sainte Foy and the Plains of Abraham on their way to the heights
that looked down with towering walls and bristling rows of ancient
guns into the lower town. They crossed the terrace and for the
first time in many years Clifton found himself again on the great
board walk, wider than a street, from the railing of which he could
look down upon the firefly glow of a thousand lights along the
river and between the age-old walls of the lower city.</p>

<p>Back of him rose the gigantic and brilliantly lighted
Ch&acirc;teau Frontenac, like a Gargantuan castle built for ten
thousand warriors to hold; below him lay a half of the history of
the New World.</p>

<p>He recalled that day when as a youth just entering into the
romance and thrill of manhood he had first stood at this dizzy edge
of Dufferin Terrace with his father, who had pointed out to him
below the spot where Champlain had landed, and where Montcalm had
lived, and had told him of some of the happenings of two and three
hundred years ago that had consecrated all that ground with its
twisted little streets, quaint chimneys and odd roofs.</p>

<p>Vividly there stood out in his memory his father's thrilling
story of the little old church of Notre Dame des Victoires, which
had stood down there almost from the beginning of time, for
Champlain himself had cleared a spot for it and had built a house
there first. The tolling of its bell came up to him sweetly now out
of the stillness of the summer evening, and he saw St. Ives make
the sign of the cross as he looked down where in day he would have
seen the steep roof and age-blackened spire of the edifice that had
stood a bulwark of glorious inspiration in those hours of strife
and blood and despair when the fortunes of New France were
blackest.</p>

<p>"It is my sister's church," he said simply. "She loves to
worship there."</p>

<p>Somehow the words, senseless as they were, came from Clifton,
"Mademoiselle St. Ives is a Catholic?"</p>

<p>"She is&mdash;everything," replied St. Ives in a strangely low
voice. "She is Catholic, yes&mdash;and she is everything else that
looks toward God. If there were more like my sister there would not
be this quarreling and ranting between sects and churches, and all
people would see God with the same eyes. The Protestant would not
be suspicious of the Catholic, nor the Pope of the Free Church, nor
the believers in Christ of those who believe only in the Unity. All
churches and all religions are holy to Antoinette St. Ives,
Monsieur!"</p>

<p>There were pride and a little defiance in his voice, as if he
half suspected that Clifton himself was accursed with the blighting
narrowness of sectarianism.</p>

<p>They came to the elevator car that traveled like a huge beetle
up and down the rock wall of the terrace, saving the winding walk
by way of Mountain Hill and Break-Neck Stairs, and a few minutes
later stood in Lower Town, and almost immediately after that
reached Notre Dame Street.</p>

<p>Here Friar Alphonse stopped, and bade his companions good
night.</p>

<p>"He has many friends among the priests and friars and monks, and
is eager to see them," explained St. Ives after he was gone. "That
is why I call him Friar. He is as much one as another, though
cowled monk is the rascal's proper place if he had kept it."</p>

<p>And now, down this street so narrow that the span of two men's
arms could have reached across it, a street of ancient brick and
stone dimly lighted by the glow of narrow windows, Gaspard St. Ives
led the way. And then, ahead of them, a lantern of hand-beaten iron
glowed with its yellow light, suspended from ancient metal arms
buried in the stone wall.</p>

<p>St. Ives paused under it with his hand on the latch of a
deep-set door.</p>

<p>"This is it, Monsieur!"</p>

<p>The door was unlocked, and they passed into a little entrance
hall not more than four feet square, with a second door of leaded
glass behind which other light revealed a curtaining of filmy lace.
This St. Ives also opened, and in another moment Clifton stood in a
bit of the heart of Old Quebec and New France.</p>

<p>The room was large and low. Its woodwork was quaint and every
darkly glowing beam and panel bore the irregular craftsmanship of
hand and adz. With the tips of his fingers St. Ives could have
touched the ceiling, yet Clifton felt no sense of being crowded. An
indescribable atmosphere of peace and comfort surrounded him. It
was as if he had stepped suddenly out of the world into a place
where turmoil and strife could not reach him and from which the
storms and vicissitudes of life were barred.</p>

<p>It had upon him the almost startling effect of a sanctuary, and
he felt that here, no matter what might happen outside, one was
safe. He did not see the furnishings of the room in detail; they
were more like the parts of a picture impressing him as a whole.
But he knew that everywhere was the presence of a great age, in the
walls themselves and the narrow, winding stairway, in the shaded
lamps, the pictures and the great dog-irons in the fireplace. In a
glance he saw all this, and two doors deep-set between heavy beams
of oak that opened into other rooms&mdash;and then he looked at his
companion.</p>

<p>St. Ives was standing with bowed head before an ivory crucifix
built in a deep niche in the wall. A moment there was silence, and
as he raised his head and saw the look in Clifton's face he
said:</p>

<p>"Pardon, Monsieur. I never forget this little duty, more for my
sister's sake than my own. This ivory figure of the Christ has
looked upon every happiness and tragedy and every laugh and tear in
this house since Crepin Marrelot put it there two hundred and fifty
years ago. It was on this floor under the Crucifix, with her hands
reaching up to it even in death, that Adelaide Marrelot was
found."</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken when a slight sound drew them quickly
about and both raised their eyes to the head of the stair. In that
moment Clifton's heart seemed for one swift instant to stop its
beating. In a mellow glory of light stood the slim figure of a
girl, and by the radiance of welcome in her face he knew that she
was Antoinette St. Ives.</p>

<p>He was grateful afterward that she seemed not to see him but was
looking at her brother, for in that moment he also knew that a
strange thing had happened within him and that it must have shown
in his face, just as in another hour that same mystery and
revealment had transformed the face of Benedict Aldous when he
looked over the low hedge in the Simla Hills and saw for the first
time the white and gold beauty and soft blue eyes of the Simla
widow.</p>

<p>And then St. Ives was going up the stair three steps at a time,
and from the top came a happy, thrilling little laugh and the
girl's voice in greeting. Clifton pulled himself together and
swallowed to keep a sudden thickening out of his throat. Nothing
had ever disturbed him quite so much&mdash;not even the Simla
widow&mdash;as the laugh and the voice as they came from Antoinette
St. Ives.</p>

<p>For he had heard them before&mdash;in Hurd's room. It was
Antoinette St. Ives who had watched the fight from her concealment
in the rest room! It was she who had laughed at the wreck of Ivan
Hurd as he had left him in his chair! And it was she&mdash;the
sister of Gaspard St. Ives&mdash;who had sent the warning over the
telephone, and who was now coming down the stair to welcome him to
this little hidden corner of an ancient world in which she
lived!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>More than one emotion swept over Clifton in the few moments it
took Antoinette St. Ives and her brother to reach the lower room.
To him she was like a lovely presence that had suddenly taken flesh
and form out of all the romance and beauty which the dark walls
about him must have sheltered in their day. St. Ives had called her
the loveliest girl in Quebec, and in this amazing hour when for the
first time a woman took possession of his soul Clifton thought of
her as the most beautiful in the world. Yet he could not have
described her had darkness suddenly shut him in, except that the
top of her head came to her brother's shoulder, and that soft brown
curls touched her cheek and neck, and that her chin was very high
as she seemed first to look at him coming down the stair.</p>

<p>And then he was looking into her eyes, steady and gray and
sweeping him from his pinnacles of assurance with their calm
loveliness, and&mdash;he thought&mdash;a bit disdainful as her lips
smiled.</p>

<p>"My sister, Monsieur Clifton Brant!"</p>

<p>The head with its velvety ripple of curls inclined itself a
little, and Clifton bowed. His ready tongue was gone. Words that
had never faltered on his lips grew dumb. He might have stood
before a princess or a queen and smiled back proudly his American
heritage of freedom and superiority, but before Antoinette St. Ives
he felt dumbness and littleness creeping upon him. He held her
extended hand and its warmth and smallness thrilled him. The blood
rose in his neck and cheeks and he hated himself for his
weakness.</p>

<p>"I am happy that you have come, Monsieur Brant!" she said in the
sweetest of French, as if the meeting had been an appointed one, "I
have waited quite impatiently for your arrival since morning. You
are welcome to what we are pleased to call our little Ch&acirc;teau
St. Ives!"</p>

<p>"You were expecting me?" he asked, as she drew her hand away. "I
thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was glad St. Ives broke in with one of his sonorous
chuckles.</p>

<p>"I must depend upon Antoinette St. Ives to secure your
forgiveness," he said, as Clifton hesitated, "though I am assured
by Friar Alphonse that a fib in good cause is a Christian act. And
what better cause could there be in this world than for the sweet
sake of my sister, who told me all about you over the telephone
that night at Grande Rivi&egrave;re du Loup, and asked me to bring
you here dead or alive but to keep to myself the reason for it, and
to breathe no word either asleep or awake that might lead you to
suspect a trap was being laid for you. And so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gaspard!"</p>

<p>"It is true, Antoinette&mdash;and I must relieve my soul of its
guileful mendacity before I take a bath!"</p>

<p>"I spoke of no trap!"</p>

<p>"Not in words, but I read your mind and there was that kind of
witchcraft in it."</p>

<p>A flush came into the girl's cheek and a defiant tilt to her
chin as she looked at Clifton. He could see the little golden
flecks in her eyes, like the tiny freckles made by fairy kisses in
petals of the wood-violet, and each little fleck was filled
suddenly with the flash of diamonds.</p>

<p>"Did he not give you my message, Monsieur Brant&mdash;and my
invitation?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The only message I received from you, Mademoiselle, came over
the telephone to my friend Benedict Aldous. For that I am
grateful."</p>

<p>"Did he not tell you other things&mdash;among them that it was
of great importance to me that I see you here within a week?"</p>

<p>"Had I told him that, Antoinette, he would have insisted on
greater haste by means of motor or train and thus have spoiled my
walking trip," interrupted St. Ives.</p>

<p>Antoinette St. Ives turned on her brother with a toss of her
head that sent her curls into an instant's riot of flashing lights
and soft confusion.</p>

<p>"For this," she said fiercely, "I shall not give you a letter
which has come for you from Angelique Fanchon!"</p>

<p>St. Ives raised his hands with a gesture of dismay.</p>

<p>"From Angelique, you say? I entreat you, Antoinette&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You shall not have it&mdash;at least not until you have had
your bath and I have seen you suffer a little. Your playfulness,
Gaspard, will one day reach a tragic point. Why did you not tell
Monsieur Brant that I had asked for him to come to me?"</p>

<p>"Because I used my man's judgment, and wanted to measure him up
as another man&mdash;without filling his head with thought of my
beautiful sister to change his disposition. And a man's judgment,
Antoinette&mdash;"</p>

<p>She interrupted him with a little shrug of her shoulders and
turned to Clifton. He had been staring at her, and in his
contemplation of her increasing loveliness had scarcely listened to
the scolding she was giving St. Ives. At first, with a kind of
shock, he had thought that her hair was cut short and curled as the
Simla widow's had been in the old days; but then he saw that the
curls were pinned up and that one which had broken loose from its
silken company almost touched her shoulder. This curl Antoinette
St. Ives tucked in its place as she turned her back upon her
brother.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Mr. Brant," she said, changing suddenly to English.
"Gaspard should have told you. I saw Mrs. Aldous within a few hours
after you had gone, and when my brother said over the telephone
that he was traveling in the company of one named Clifton Brant I
think my heart almost stopped, for you were the one man in the
world I wanted to see very soon and I was afraid I might have lost
you indefinitely. I told him to let you know that I was in Ivan
Hurd's room when you&mdash;annoyed him that afternoon."</p>

<p>A humorous light lay in her eyes as she recalled this incident.
It was a look that gave Clifton back his courage and mental
balance. She was still laughing at Hurd as he had sat huddled in
his chair. Then it came upon him that he had been unsettled by the
presence of a very small person, one not a mote larger than the
Simla widow who yet appeared to be taller by inches. He could have
tossed her to a ceiling twice as high as that of the room in which
they stood. She was exquisitely feminine, and yet he sensed in an
instant the difference between her and Benedict's wife. The Simla
widow, finding herself fighting, would win her way with softness
and tears while Antoinette St. Ives would win or die with that same
proud tilt to her head and with eyes that might fill with tears yet
never lose the steady glow of gray fires that lay in their
beautiful depths. He liked it that way better.</p>

<p>"I heard your voice," he said. "I am sure it would have drawn me
back, but I was a little dizzy and sick from a blow on the head.
Hearing your voice in that room was the greatest surprise of my
life, just as meeting you now is the greatest pleasure that has
ever come to me."</p>

<p>"That is strange, Monsieur Brant. I was afraid it would be an
annoyance instead of a pleasure to you. You have such a terrible
reputation as a woman-hater&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Clairette Aldous told you that?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and detest women with short hair, though mine is not
entirely that, and is curled by nature if you please&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She told you that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and so many other things that I feel you are scarcely a
stranger."</p>

<p>"Then she has helped me some, thank God!"</p>

<p>"But you are a fighter in spite of the hopelessness of your
other shortcomings," she went on. "I have had a most unforgettable
demonstration of that. Otherwise I am sure I should never have been
interested in you."</p>

<p>St. Ives touched his sister gently on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"If you will give me Angelique Fanchon's letter&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not until you have had your bath and dinner."</p>

<p>"But it may be important."</p>

<p>"I think it is, Gaspard."</p>

<p>"And you will not give it to me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then I may as well drag you away to water and soap, Friend
Clifton, for this lovely sister of mine has a stubbornness like the
Devil's own when her mind is once made up." He bent his big head
and like a lover kissed her smooth hair where it was parted in the
middle; and almost in the same moment Antoinette St. Ives's hand
went to her bosom and drew forth a letter which she gave to her
brother.</p>

<p>"That kiss does away with a hundred sins, Gaspard," she said
softly. "I hope the letter brings you happiness!"</p>

<p>Clifton's heart throbbed warmly at the look of swift tenderness
that had come into her face. As he followed St. Ives up the stair
he thought of it as a flash of sunshine that had come suddenly out
from behind the still tranquillity of a beautiful cloud. A look
like that must fill a man's soul with the glory of loving!</p>

<p>St. Ives ushered him into a little bedroom with a low roof that
sloped almost to the floor on one side, and returned for his pack.
When Clifton had selected the best of his clothing, consisting of a
clean outfit of walking togs, he was introduced to a smaller room
half occupied by a porcelain tub. St. Ives, still clutching
Angelique's letter in his big hand, made him an elaborate bow.</p>

<p>"Behold the chief luxury of Ch&acirc;teau St. Ives,
Monsieur&mdash;our bathing urn, which Antoinette insists upon
calling a vaporarium. There is hot water in the right spigot and
cold in the left. The tub measures four feet in one direction by
three in the other, so make your measurements carefully before
diving into it. And if you will pardon me for leaving you while I
read Angelique's letter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't let me detain you another moment from that pleasure,"
urged Clifton. "I join your sister in hoping that it brings you
joy."</p>

<p>He had partly finished with his bath when the door opened and
St. Ives rushed in. His face was blazing and the letter was
crumpled in his hand.</p>

<p>"Joy!" he exclaimed. "This thing brings me joy!&mdash;this
two-paged parcel of impertinence, this woman's falseness and deceit
flung like birdlime at a real man&mdash;this&mdash;this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What does it say?" interrupted Clifton soothingly.</p>

<p>"Say? It says nothing about me! From beginning to end it is
filled only with this Ajax Trappier, how fine his horses are, what
a splendid man he is, how he supports the church like a saint and
drives over to take her riding each Sunday! It is an insult,
Monsieur, and I thirst for the blood of the man who is the cause of
it! Why should she peddle me the gossip of this polisson who bought
his way out of the war, this reptile who would sell himself to the
Devil to get her, this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know," interrupted Clifton again, standing up in the
tub. "Let me read it, Gaspard!"</p>

<p>St. Ives smoothed out the crumpled letter and placed it in his
hands. As Clifton read he smiled, and Gaspard's face darkened with
wrath.</p>

<p>"It is quite clear," said Clifton. "I think that in many things
Friar Alphonse is right, and in this one particularly so. You are
thick-headed, St. Ives. Angelique Fanchon wrote this letter because
her heart is eating itself up with love for you, and she is taking
a woman's way of bringing you to time. You have quarreled with her
recently?"</p>

<p>"A little misunderstanding caused by a difference in viewpoint.
She thinks I am a wanderer and a good-for-nothing because I love
the woods and the big rivers more than I do a farm and horses and
pigs."</p>

<p>"And you love her?"</p>

<p>"I would pull down the stars and give them to her if I
could."</p>

<p>"Yet you would not become a habitant for her sake?"</p>

<p>"I will not be bullied by a woman and that priest at Saint
F&eacute;licien who is urging her to marry Ajax Trappier and have
twenty children."</p>

<p>"Then what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>St. Ives sucked in a hissing breath of vapor and air.</p>

<p>"I am going to break every bone in Ajax Trappier's overgrown
body!"</p>

<p>"Good!" nodded Clifton, returning the letter. "And let us be
about that business as soon as we can. It is my opinion that
Angelique would cry her eyes out with fear if she knew you were
going into this danger. But I also think it will do a lot of good,
no matter who wins in the contest."</p>

<p>"You guess that she loves me?"</p>

<p>"I am sure of it."</p>

<p>Gaspard smoothed out the letter and read it again while Clifton
dried himself.</p>

<p>"If that is true," he said in a softened voice, "I swear to
Sainte Anne I will never sing in a tap-room again! And I wouldn't
mind owning a farm if I could leave it fallow, and if it was near
the big rivers, and if this skunk of an Ajax Trappier whose scent
offends me lived in the next county."</p>

<p>"Have you asked her to marry you?"</p>

<p>"How could I unless I promised first to become a farmer? But she
knows that I love her. I have told her that!"</p>

<p>"I wonder why she is so insistent?" mused Clifton, his words
only half implying a question.</p>

<p>St. Ives was silent for a moment, then laughed softly.</p>

<p>"If it was not for this accursed Ajax Trappier I would not blame
her. It is in her blood. Her great-great-grandfather settled in the
Saint F&eacute;licien country a hundred and sixty years ago, and
the Fanchons have lived on the same land all that time. Angelique
is proud of all that and holds her head high. They are great
land-owners and she is a princess in her country. And I&mdash;" St.
Ives shrugged his shoulders hopelessly. "Tonight you will learn why
I am almost a pauper, and a St. Ives is too proud to accept a
Fanchon patrimony along with his wife. I have opened the shell and
you have the meat of the thing now! If Angelique Fanchon marries
St. Ives she must go with him to a place where he can build a home
for her himself." He turned to the door. "Will you come down when
you are ready, Monsieur Clifton?"</p>

<p>After he had gone Clifton shaved himself and dressed. For a
quarter of an hour the same unanswerable questions repeated
themselves in his mind, and by the time he finished he had worked
himself into a fair state of mental excitement. Something told him
he was on the edge of the greatest adventure of his life, and the
probability that Antoinette St. Ives was included in this adventure
and was possibly the heart and soul of it aroused every nerve in
his body with eager anticipation.</p>

<p>She was waiting for him when he descended the stair, and St.
Ives had disappeared. He caught her reading and as he looked down
on her bowed head its color made him think of the rich tints of a
chestnut burnished and ripened by heavy frosts. He was not a
dissembler. His admiration shone in his eyes.</p>

<p>"The warrior!" she greeted him. "My brother has been telling me
how you helped him out of the trouble at L'Assomption and then beat
him in a walking match on the highway. You do not look so terrible,
and unless I had seen with my own eyes I am quite sure I should
doubt Gaspard a little."</p>

<p>Her reference to the battle in Hurd's office was accompanied by
what Clifton accepted as a covert note of humor in her voice. She
was laughing at him for some reason, and suddenly his choler began
to rise as he thought of the many uncomplimentary truths which the
Simla widow might have revealed about him.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?"</p>

<p>He seated himself stiffly.</p>

<p>"I am at your command," he said.</p>

<p>She bent her head a little so that the glow from above caught
her curls with enrapturing lights. He could see her long lashes, a
bit darker than her hair, the pink of her cheeks and the soft red
of her mouth&mdash;and his heart rose up and choked him.</p>

<p>"Please do not be so uncomfortably formal," she entreated. "I
can understand why you have such an outrageous opinion of me, and I
am quite frank in expressing myself when I say that I do not like
you&mdash;but such trivial matters must not come between us at the
present time. Not, at least, until you understand the very
important reason why I have had you come to Ch&acirc;teau St.
Ives."</p>

<p>"Why should I have a bad opinion of you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Because I was concealed in Mr. Hurd's rest room, of course!
Nice young ladies are not caught in such a compromising situation,
are they?"</p>

<p>"And you don't like me? Why?"</p>

<p>"Because you have no heart, no soul, no
romance&mdash;because&mdash;"</p>

<p>Clifton rose protestingly from his chair.</p>

<p>"It's Clairette Aldous! She told you a lot about me, didn't she?
And you haven't hesitated to let me know about it, almost before
I'm dry from the use of your vaporarium. In fact I dressed myself
before I was dry. And why did I do it? Why was I in such haste? I'm
going to be frank with you, too. I'm going to shock you. It was all
because of you! I wanted to look at you again. I wanted the
opportunity of telling you that from the moment I found you were
acquainted with Ivan Hurd something told me you were the girl whose
voice I fell in love with that day. But I did not dream that good
fortune would compel me in self-defense to disclose the cataclysmic
thing which happened when I first looked up and saw you at the head
of the stair. You have forced me to make that disclosure by
intimating that I have a bad opinion of you, have actually
necessitated the confession that my heart turned somersaults, and
that at no time in all the history of the world&mdash;in spite of
the fact that I have no heart and no soul and no romance&mdash;has
a man ever been readier to die for a woman than I am this very
minute for you! So I repeat&mdash;I am at your command!"</p>

<p>He paused for breath.</p>

<p>"It's your turn, Mademoiselle!"</p>

<p>Antoinette St. Ives, looking up at him as he stood before her,
had turned red and then white. And now he was laughing down into
her face, even though his mouth was a little tense. There was
something more than jest in his eyes. Clairette Aldous had told her
he was a man of remarkable possibilities, and he was. She rose from
her chair and stood so close to him that he might have touched her.
Never had he seen anything so coldly, gloriously beautiful as her
eyes looking straight into his.</p>

<p>"With one exception this is the most infamous piece of
effrontery I have ever listened to!" she said in quiet disdain.</p>

<p>"And that exception?" asked Clifton undismayed.</p>

<p>"There is only one other capable of subjecting me to
it&mdash;Ivan Hurd!"</p>

<p>"For which I shall cheerfully kill him when the opportunity
arrives," he declared, bowing as if to a princess. "I am your
slave, Mademoiselle. And to be most efficient a slave should love
his mistress."</p>

<p>Not for a moment did her eyes waver. The changing light in them
seemed to draw out his soul. He knew that he wanted to touch her.
He wanted to put a hand on her shining head. She seemed to read the
thought, and her chin tilted itself another fraction of an inch. It
was a gesture which would have put an immense gulf between her and
any man. Clifton liked it though it struck him like a barbed
shaft.</p>

<p>The tenseness of the moment was interrupted by the opening of
the street door, and Gaspard's voice came to them from the little
vestibule. It was answered by another, and the look of pleasure
that came suddenly into the girl's face pierced Clifton even more
than the haughty tilt of her chin. For the first time in his life
he knew jealousy. It was upon him with the swiftness of
lightning&mdash;and in that abysmal moment when Antoinette St.
Ives's face and eyes lighted up like that at the sound of a man's
voice he knew how far he had fallen.</p>

<p>He turned slowly, getting a dogged hold of himself. He was a
fool, and an old fool at that. He was almost forty, and Antoinette
St. Ives could be scarcely more than twenty. There were hard lines
about his mouth as he saw Gaspard's companion&mdash;a slender,
pale-faced man with graying hair above his ears. He stared. He saw
Gaspard standing a little behind, grinning. Antoinette St. Ives was
regarding them both with shining eyes.</p>

<p>And then in the same instant both men advanced with a cry of
greeting and outstretched hands.</p>

<p>"Denis&mdash;Colonel John Denis!"</p>

<p>"Captain Brant!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>It was a surprise for Clifton&mdash;this sudden meeting with the
old friend at whose side he had fought through the hells of
Flanders. He had expected to look him up while in Quebec, for it
was at Sanctuary Wood that Colonel Denis had dragged him half dead
off a field that fifteen minutes later was pounded into a pulp by
shell-fire&mdash;and after that day a friendship had developed
which years and distance had failed to obliterate. If he had met
him on the street the shock would have been less. But to find him
here, another factor in the mystery and adventure which had drawn
him in its web, and to see the eyes of Antoinette St. Ives light up
so beautifully at his coming made his heart pump almost audibly as
he wrung the other's hand.</p>

<p>With John Denis their meeting bore an aspect entirely apart from
emotion aroused by its unexpectedness. Denis had known of his
presence and had come purposely to see him within an hour after his
arrival at Antoinette's home. That fact was quite evident in the
manner of the Colonel's greeting. It lacked the agitation of sudden
surprise. But his fingers clung like slender bands of steel to
Clifton's and his voice trembled with the sincerity of his emotion.
Here was more than friend meeting friend; it was comrade meeting
comrade, brother meeting brother. St. Ives had drawn away and in
Antoinette's eyes came a swift change, a soft glow with tears close
behind it as she saw John Denis's lips atremble.</p>

<p>Then Clifton saw with another kind of sensation the marked
change in this man whose gallantry and bravery had made him one of
the conspicuous inspirations of the Princess Pats in their days of
travail and death. He had aged many years. His shoulders were a
little bent. A tragedy of some kind was hiding itself deep back in
his eyes and he was clearly under an excitement which he was trying
hard to conceal.</p>

<p>But it found voice in his words.</p>

<p>"Thank God, Clifton! All the world could not have sent me a man
I want more than I want you!"</p>

<p>They were strange words coming from a man like Colonel Denis,
and almost identical with those of Antoinette St. Ives. Clifton
turned toward her and caught her regarding him in a way that added
to the thumping agitation of his heart. But instantly, when she
found herself discovered, there came the upward little tilt to her
chin as if she was altogether beneath such an intimate observation
on her part.</p>

<p>Then she was excusing herself, and left the room. With a word of
apology, Gaspard headed up the stair for his bath.</p>

<p>Scarcely were they alone when Colonel Denis drew in a sharp
breath.</p>

<p>"It is amazing how things have been happening during the last
week, Clifton," he said. "I am not going to spoil Antoinette's
dinner for you by going into unpleasant details. They always come
better on a full stomach, don't you think? But there have been
certain remarkable occurrences which I know will interest you while
we are waiting. In the first place, do you remember the day when
you were walking the highway this side of Brantford in the company
of a boy and a dog? Well, an automobile passed you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Clifton nodded with a flash of his old humor.</p>

<p>"Many of them passed us, John!"</p>

<p>"But in this particular car were Antoinette St. Ives and myself.
I saw you. And I was so upset by your resemblance to the man I
thought was murdered at Haipoong that I gave voice to my emotion.
Antoinette insisted on stopping the car, but when the dust had
cleared away you and the boy and the dog were cutting across a
field toward a wood. We went on and Antoinette urged me to tell her
all about the man whose ghost I had just seen. I did. You know how
friends smother us with flowers when we are dead, Clifton? Well, I
did that for you. I pictured you for Mademoiselle St. Ives as the
greatest, cleanest, squarest fighter in the world, and a
woman-hater from the toes of your boots to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The devil!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Go on!"</p>

<p>"And after that, knowing you so well from my description, you
can imagine her surprise when you came to life in Ivan Hurd's
office, declared yourself, told your story, made that scoundrel
confess himself a criminal on his knees&mdash;and then punished him
as you did. She was in the little room off Hurd's office and
witnessed it all."</p>

<p>"I know it," nodded Clifton. "And I am mighty curious to
discover why she gave no evidence of her presence when she thought
I was going to kill Hurd, why she didn't run out and scream and
throw a fit&mdash;as most women would have done. At least it would
have shown good taste if she had fainted!"</p>

<p>"Of course. I think I expressed something like that when she
told me about it and I had recovered from my amazement and joy in
the knowledge that you were not dead but very much alive. And she
told me an astonishing thing, swearing to it by that crucifix up
there&mdash;and Antoinette would suffer death at the stake rather
than commit such a sacrilege if she were not telling the truth. She
said that from the beginning&mdash;from the instant you declared
yourself to Hurd&mdash;she knew you would not kill him. <i>And she
wanted to learn the truth of that story of your father's ruin and
death as it came from your lips</i>! She saw Hurd on his knees and
listened to his confession.</p>

<p>"Look about you! This typifies what she is. The most beautiful,
sweetest, purest girl in this city of Quebec&mdash;yet a little
tigress inspired by a pitiless determination when it comes to
combating an evil or a wrong. She is of the New France of two
hundred years ago, and the seigneurs' fighting blood and their
culture and ideals of honor are a part of her. So she was not
afraid when she saw you fighting Hurd, and was confident you would
not kill him. For she knew you were right, and she confessed to me
that in the little room she was praying for you, believing that God
would bring you out safely. That was why she did not scream or
faint."</p>

<p>John Denis finished with a gesture half of hope and half
despair.</p>

<p>"And she is equally sure that confidence and prayer&mdash;and
<i>you</i>&mdash;will save us from the ruin which confronts us now.
She has a most monumental faith in Clifton Brant. Has she not told
you so?"</p>

<p>"Rather the opposite," said Clifton. "She was abusing me when
you came in."</p>

<p>For the first time the tense look in the other's face
disappeared and humor flashed into it.</p>

<p>"I might have guessed it by the gladness of her greeting when I
arrived. What had you been doing?"</p>

<p>"I used her vaporarium without protest."</p>

<p>"What besides?"</p>

<p>"I told her how my heart inverted itself when I first saw her at
the top of the stair, and how lovely she was."</p>

<p>"Ye gods!"</p>

<p>"And then, when she began to abuse me, I told her that from the
moment I heard her voice in Hurd's room I was in love with her, and
had just found it out. I do not believe in dissembling. I spoke the
truth."</p>

<p>"And Antoinette St. Ives stood for that!"</p>

<p>"No, John, she did not. I think she is my enemy for life, but I
am going to follow the Lord's injunction and continue to love this
particular person who hates me. That
is&mdash;unless&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Colonel Denis shook his head.</p>

<p>"It won't hurt me, Clifton. That part of my heart which should
hold a woman's love must be dead."</p>

<p>"I thought that, too. It's a fool thought. And when a man wakes
up to that discovery he is sure to make an ass of himself. But I
haven't heard what I am waiting for, and what Antoinette St. Ives
did not tell me. What is this ruin that faces you both? Why are you
both involved? What is the big fight that seems to have been
preparing itself for my arrival? I have already promised Gaspard to
help him out in his love affair with Angelique Fanchon. I have also
sworn to die for Antoinette St. Ives at any time she may call upon
me for that trivial sacrifice. In addition to these little matters
Ivan Hurd has set the police after me and I am in love with myself.
And still the <i>big fight</i>&mdash;if I understand you and
Mademoiselle Antoinette&mdash;has not yet been placed on my
schedule. Please let me hear about it!"</p>

<p>"Not until after dinner. Antoinette made me promise that."</p>

<p>"And Colonel Denis always keeps a promise he has given," came a
sweet voice from behind them. "Pardon me for overhearing your last
few words. Dinner is ready, and Gaspard has come down raving with
hunger. Captain Brant, will you humiliate yourself so much as to
give me the courtesy of your arm? I promise to touch it lightly,
merely with the tips of my fingers!"</p>

<p>"I wish it might carry you entirely," he whispered, bending over
her as they preceded Colonel Denis through one of the doors.</p>

<p>The moment gave him a bewildering opportunity of looking at her
when she was thrillingly near to him. He had never dreamed that
anything could be quite so exquisite as her head and her hair as he
looked down on them. He would have given half a year of his life if
her short curls could suddenly have tumbled about her shoulders,
for that was the way he was picturing them. They would just about
reach to her shoulders if loosened from their bondage, he
thought&mdash;a deadly disarray of velvety gloss and sheen that
would have disrupted any man's soul! And she had told him, with a
stinging note in her words, that they were not a result of that
detestable maggot in the feminine brain&mdash;the passion for
bobbing. He felt like bestowing upon her a verbal commendation, but
the tilt of her chin had reached a dangerous angle as she
intuitively guessed the advantage he was taking of her.</p>

<p>The room which they entered, like the first, seemed to Clifton
to be a relic of a forgotten age. It was smaller, with huge beams
in the ceiling and paneled walls of oak and a fireplace at one end
in which the old cranes of hammered iron still remained. The table
in the center of the room was small but massive and had been carved
out by hand, as had the chairs about it. On the table, illumining
it with a soft glow, was a candelabrum of such ancient and unusual
design that Clifton's eyes involuntarily rested upon it as they
seated themselves.</p>

<p>Antoinette St. Ives observed his interest as she tinkled a
silvery little bell at her side.</p>

<p>"You are curious, Monsieur Brant," she said, with a formality
that robbed his heart and his lips of any lightness of thought that
might have been in one or on the other. "We are proud of our little
place, and I am sure you would be interested in some of its tales
and the relics we have in it."</p>

<p>And as he looked at her now, like a lovely princess presiding
over royalty at her table, he could have bitten his tongue in two
for its boldness and impertinence, of a previous moment. What must
she think of him? A clown for his boldness, a venturesome boor
because of his flippant tongue&mdash;and a fool above everything!
Yet, in God's name, it had not been his intention to appear any one
of these&mdash;and less so in her eyes than in the opinion of all
the rest of the world!</p>

<p>His voice was subdued when he answered.</p>

<p>"All my life I have wished that I might have lived centuries ago
in place of now," he said. "So you may understand a little how
coming into a place like this kindles me with that old thought,
Mademoiselle. I think that is why I have been a wanderer. It is
because of restlessness, a desire which can never be attained, a
taint of heritage in my blood that is a calamity in this age. You
are fortunate. If this little place were mine I would not exchange
it for the Ch&acirc;teau Frontenac which looks down on you from
above!"</p>

<p>A glow of pleasure suffused the girl's face.</p>

<p>"I can guess a little of that, Monsieur, or you would not have
slept in the old Indian cemetery of your forefathers near Brantford
Town. Little Joe told me about it, and how you brought him to
Montreal. In the Chapel of the Ursulines is a votive lamp given by
Marie de Repentigny in seventeen hundred and seventeen, and in
spite of the vicissitudes of centuries and long sieges in which
shot and shell have many times torn the convent walls that lamp has
been kept burning through all the years since then.</p>

<p>"You have undoubtedly seen the lamp, a reminder of the greatest
romantic tragedy in New France, when Am&eacute;lie de Repentigny,
sweetest of all women then living, cut off her beautiful hair and
became a nun because her brother in a moment of drunken insanity
killed the father of her lover. In seventeen hundred and nineteen,
the year Am&eacute;lie died of heartbreak behind the convent walls,
this candelabrum on our table was given to a Marrolet by the mother
of Am&eacute;lie, and here it has remained since then. Many ghosts
walk in this little house. It was here Am&eacute;lie met her lover.
Can you question me for loving it?"</p>

<p>"I honor you," said Clifton, and in his heart he worshiped
it.</p>

<p>He had believed that the hour at table would clear somewhat the
mystery of the situation of which he had become a part. But if ruin
and tragedy hovered over the three in whose company he sat, there
was no revealment of it in either their bearing or their words.</p>

<p>Colonel Denis had thrown off the tenseness which had accompanied
him into the home of Antoinette St. Ives and his face grew softer
in the glow of the candles. Even Gaspard was a changed man and
smiled and said pleasant things to his sister as if the bitterness
of his love affair was not gnawing at his heart. Here, with their
food, the troubles of the world were deliberately held away, and
from the moment Antoinette St. Ives had bowed her lovely head to
repeat in a sweet, low voice the words, "Be present at our table,
Lord, be here and everywhere adored, these creatures bless and
grant that we may feast in Paradise with Thee"&mdash;a spirit of
peace and happiness seemed to fill the room. In those moments of
serene stillness when the gentle lips of the girl sent up their
prayer he thought of her as an angel, and when it was finished and
he looked across at John Denis the thought lay in his eyes, "If
prayers like hers are not answered there can be no God!"</p>

<p>And after that the little stories and bits of romance of the old
home fell like epics in poetry from her lips, so deeply had she
cherished them in her heart; and Gaspard told of the old
swashbuckling days when half the excitement in New France was down
below the citadel walls, and the dainty feet and clanking rapiers
of beauty and chivalry came to worship at the Notre Dame des
Victoires, or to see the pilloried rascals in front of it, or
witness a hanging where the ancient scaffold stood in the square.
And up and down these streets, old and decaying alleys now, were
the homes of bright eyes and gallant hearts, and fluffs and lace
and sweet perfume and love-making where dirty children now cried
out for pennies from gaping men and women who came to look upon the
decaying ruins of a glorious past. Clifton could have sworn he
caught an instant's mist of tears in the eyes of Antoinette St.
Ives as she said, "It is a sacrilege to let them disappear in ruin
and beggary. Do we care so little for the honor of our forefathers,
for the men and women whose courage and faith in God gave us a new
world and a nation? And it began here, where these little streets
now are, a part of it in this house&mdash;and at the very table
where we are sitting!"</p>

<p>And then suddenly she smiled at John Denis and murmured an
apology for speaking of an unpleasant subject at this time when
there were so many beautiful things in the world to talk about.</p>

<p>It was after this that Clifton said, venturing upon the edge of
a matter of which he was a little afraid, "I hope you like my
friends Benedict Aldous&mdash;and his wife?"</p>

<p>"I do," she replied. "They insisted that I remain in their home
as a guest when they found I did not live in Montreal. I was there
three days. I fell in love with Joe and Bim, and think I shall
adopt them."</p>

<p>"Adopt them?" gasped Clifton.</p>

<p>"Yes, adopt them," she repeated coolly. "They need a mothering
influence, and Clairette Aldous has her hands full with two of
their own, though she was planning to keep Joe and Bim until I told
her how I felt about it and asked her to let me bring them to
Quebec. Madame Aldous would not let Joe come until she could
properly clothe him. She is one of the sweetest women I have ever
met. I think there are very few like her in this world&mdash;and
Monsieur Aldous is a lucky man to have her!"</p>

<p>With those last words her eyes met Clifton's. It was the nearest
she had come to shooting another dagger at him.</p>

<p>"Of course it was understood that if you should have a serious
objection to my taking Joe and Bim, or wished to retain a certain
partnership interest in them&mdash;but we can discuss that
tomorrow, Captain Brant, after Joe and Bim arrive. They are coming
in the morning!"</p>

<p>"But Joe," insisted Clifton. "He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, he likes me, and is glad to come," she smiled, with a
little flash back in her eyes. "At first I frightened him, due
quite naturally to his training, Monsieur Brant. He seems to have a
mysterious horror of short hair, and when he first saw me in the
hallway near his room my hair was down, and as I held out my hands
to him he backed away from me as if I were a plague. Afterward,
when certain definitions were explained to him and he came to
understand that short hair and million-dollar-something-or-others
did not always go together, he became quite lovable. Won't you have
another cup of coffee, Captain Brant?"</p>

<p>Clifton felt himself burning up, a fact of which Antoinette
seemed sweetly oblivious. She poured his coffee and added sugar to
it with her pretty fingers, and at the same time spoke to Colonel
Denis about the new French opera, as if to drag his attention from
any effect which her shot might have had upon Clifton.</p>

<p>"'Venus and the Graces' is a pretty name for it," she went on.
"The Three Graces, Euphrosyne, Aglaia and Thalia are all quite
modern. They wear crowns of purple grapes in the Greek style and
have bobbed hair. Do you like bobbed hair, Captain Brant?" she
asked, turning on him innocently.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;sometimes," he countered in cold desperation.
"I love beautiful hair."</p>

<p>A soft regret filled the girl's voice.</p>

<p>"I have always wanted hair like Am&eacute;lie de Repentigny's,"
she said. "The history book of the nuns tells us it was the most
beautiful in all Quebec and that even M&egrave;re Mignon de la
Nativit&eacute;, the Superior of the convent, wept when her
scissors snipped off the silken tresses. But such beautiful fortune
has not come to me, and I have never had greater crowning glory
than this." And with two slim fingers she straightened one of her
lustrous curls for them to observe, and Clifton saw that his guess
was right and that loosened they would have clustered about her
shoulders.</p>

<p>The chuckle that was like a subdued laugh rose in Gaspard as he
said:</p>

<p>"My sister knows her hair is the most beautiful in Quebec today,
just as Am&eacute;lie de Repentigny's was two hundred years ago, or
she would not draw our attention so closely to it."</p>

<p>Antoinette St. Ives let the curl back suddenly and blushed to
her eyes, and Clifton felt like shouting out his gratitude to the
blundering Gaspard.</p>

<p>"I did not mean it to be taken in that way, Gaspard," she
reproved.</p>

<p>"And it was not taken as he has intimated, at least not by me,"
emphasized Clifton, trying to smother a note of triumph in his
voice. "And it is beautiful, Mademoiselle! Have you ever seen
lovelier, Colonel Denis?"</p>

<p>"Never," said John Denis, and surreptitiously his eyes stole to
an old wooden clock ticking off its seconds on an oaken mantel.</p>

<p>In spite of its secrecy and her own confusion, Antoinette caught
the glance and understood its significance. A few minutes later
they stood again in the room into which Clifton had first
entered.</p>

<p>There was no longer an element of hesitation or repression in
the manner of Colonel Denis. He was openly eager to get away and
take Clifton with him, and Antoinette St. Ives let it be known
quite frankly that the real hour in this night was about to strike
and that it meant much to her. John Denis went a little ahead with
Gaspard, and Clifton guessed that it was with the purpose of giving
the girl a last word with him.</p>

<p>Never would he be able to wipe out of his memory the dignity and
beauty of her or the quiet, proud appeal in her lovely eyes as she
gave him her hand in parting.</p>

<p>"Colonel Denis will tell you everything, Captain Brant," she
said. "And I pray God you are the man I have judged you to
be&mdash;the only man I have ever known that I would commit myself
so boldly to&mdash;and that you will help us in our hour of trial
if you can. Why I should believe that through you we can be saved
from a situation which seems hopeless is a mystery to me. But I do.
That hour in Ivan Hurd's room gave me an infinite faith in
you&mdash;as a fighting man!"</p>

<p>"But in another way, Mademoiselle&mdash;as a man without heart
or soul or romance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forgive me, please! You have these things. It was a perverse
whim that made me say otherwise."</p>

<p>"Then you do not despise me for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For what?" she asked, forgetful for a moment.</p>

<p>"For that boldness which made me ready to lay down my life for
you when I saw you at the head of the stair, and for afterward
giving even bolder voice to that truth which my heart could not
withhold&mdash;my love for you."</p>

<p>"<i>Monsieur!</i>"</p>

<p>He bent over her head, and did not look into her eyes.</p>

<p>"If my life can lighten the burden that is oppressing you it
shall be lightened, Mademoiselle St. Ives," he said softly, and as
he went out into the dark little street that clung to the great
rock wall of the Terrace it was with the thrilling knowledge that
for a single moment the fingers of the hand which he had held had
tightened a little more closely about his own.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>Denis and St. Ives were waiting for him, but at the end of the
short street Gaspard said good night and turned back.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later they entered Colonel Denis's private
office in the small building occupied by the Laurentian Pulp and
Paper Company. Clifton looked about him with a word of approbation
and pleasure. This was like coming home. It was the same office,
with the same great oaken desk from which John Denis had taken the
last two cigars they had smoked together before they left for the
war ten years ago. The same maps and blue-prints and pictures hung
on the walls, it seemed to Clifton, and the same old-fashioned
comfort and lack of stiffness were about him&mdash;the atmosphere
of English gentlemen whose great business had been something more
than a machine for making dollars and building fortunes. In their
same positions against the walls were the oil paintings of Sir
William Denis and the Honorable Cecil Stanford, founders of the
Laurentian Pulp and Paper Company, both mighty names among the
pioneers of Quebec's greatest industry, and dead these many years;
and between them, with his rugged, fighting face and deep-set eyes,
was the Colonel's grandfather, John Denis the first, who had given
to the Provincial government its greatest knowledge of the vast
timber resources beyond the emptying waters of the Mistassini, the
Peribonka and the Ashuapmouchan. And from their frames looked down
the faces of other men who had played their parts in building up
the honor and varying fortunes of this oldest and proudest
institution of its kind in Canada. Over the oaken desk was a plain
birch frame carved by Sir William's jackknife forty years before,
and in it the fading words, "<i>God before success. Honor before
the dollar.</i>"</p>

<p>Clifton, seeing the words again after many years, read them
aloud, and added:</p>

<p>"Sir William's Golden Rule has always remained an unforgettable
thing in my heart. I wish I might have lived a little more closely
to it. And you have not changed here! I can fairly breathe the
inspiration of this room&mdash;that spirit which has made the
Laurentian Pulp and Paper Company a classic among its fellows, a
blazer of trails, a leader in thought and action and the savior of
Quebec's forest lands if you want to put it that way."</p>

<p>"And tonight all this is&mdash;dead," said John Denis with a
note of despair in his voice. "Sit down, Clifton. Make yourself at
home&mdash;and light up a cigar."</p>

<p>"Dead!" exclaimed Clifton. "Dead!&mdash;with Sir William looking
down at you with the benignity of a guardian angel, and Grandfather
Denis watching with those fighting eyes of his, like a fierce old
Recollet damning a horde of scalping savages to perdition? Why,
man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd give ten years of my life if Grandfather Denis could step
down out of that frame and fill my shoes for six months, Clifton.
It would be worth that much to me&mdash;and to Antoinette St. Ives.
At least he would give an account of himself, if he died on the
gallows for it. He was that sort of a man."</p>

<p>"No man ever lived, not even your Grandfather Denis, who would
have fought harder for Antoinette St. Ives than I am willing to
fight," said Clifton tensely. "I am ready. What is the
trouble?"</p>

<p>"The same thing that happened to your father," said John Denis
in a quiet voice. "That is why it has seemed to me a special act of
Providence that you did not die at Haipoong but lived to make your
appearance in that miraculous hour in Ivan Hurd's office.
Antoinette is even more assured in her conviction that it was the
hand of God. Otherwise why should you, of all men on earth, come
like a ghost out of your grave at that very moment when
Mademoiselle St. Ives was being asked to sell her soul to Ivan
Hurd? There is something uncanny about it, Clifton!"</p>

<p>Clifton was on his feet. "Until now I have been patient, Colonel
Denis. In God's name come to the point! What has Ivan Hurd to do
with Antoinette St. Ives?"</p>

<p>"And with me, you might add," said Denis, with a shrug of his
shoulders. "I wish I might snap a finger and let you see and
understand the entire situation that quickly. But it is impossible.
You have been away many years and must be given the fundamentals
first. Otherwise you might be inclined to laugh at me. The details
can only be prefaced by the fact that unless something incredibly
unexpected happens very soon the Laurentian Pulp and Paper Company
will go out of existence, a ragged bankrupt. And with it will go
the hearts and souls of Antoinette and her brother. Of course you
do not understand how they can be so intimately associated with my
own ruin, but you will in a few minutes if you will have patience
with me. It is not a matter of financial loss so far as it affects
them personally. They care even less for that than I do. I face
ruin as it is thought of in dollars and cents and loss of
pride&mdash;but that is all. Antoinette St. Ives faces a more
serious thing. Do you know Ivan Hurd? Not as he was years ago, but
as he is today?"</p>

<p>"Only from my experience with him in his office. And Benedict
Aldous told me he was a very wealthy man and a political power in
the Province, and extremely dangerous to those who oppose him.
<i>Le Taureau</i>, I think Benedict said they called him&mdash;the
Bull. An all-round scoundrel, I should say, with plenty of friends
to back him!"</p>

<p>"I cannot conceive how it would be possible for the situation to
be any worse," said Colonel Denis bitterly. "You've got to know
about Hurd before you can understand the rest. You know how he
destroyed your father and what your father was building up. But
Ivan Hurd was a pigmy then. He is a giant now. I don't want you to
understand that our provincial legislators, taken as a whole, are
rotten or dishonest. I am confident that even a majority of them
would like to see Ivan Hurd go down and out. But those who are not
with him are afraid of him. A dozen times in the last five years a
David has risen to fight Hurd, and each time that David has gone
down to ruin not only politically but in almost every instance in a
personally financial way as well. Hurd is getting away with more
than dishonesty and graft and the legislation he wants. He is
simply too powerful to touch, and is getting away with crime as
well. That is the man you humiliated and made your deadly enemy in
Montreal!"</p>

<p>John Denis's voice had fallen into the short, sharp speech of
his army days. His thin face had flushed. His eyes blazed, and he
paced back and forth before Clifton as he talked, his hands
clenched at his sides.</p>

<p>"I should have killed him," said Clifton. "But he is still
alive, and my opportunity lives with him."</p>

<p>He was thinking of Antoinette St. Ives and his heart was
throbbing with the suspense of waiting for the other's revealment
of her relationship to Hurd. But he did not break in with the
impetuous questioning which was at his tongue's end. He waited.</p>

<p>As he spread out a map on a table Colonel Denis said:</p>

<p>"I think you should. Your danger would have been scarcely
greater than it is now. Hurd considers you a dangerous menace or he
would not have attempted your assassination at Haipoong. Antoinette
told me of that affair as it was given to her by Benedict Aldous.
And Hurd knows that you are a greater menace than ever to him now.
He acted in haste and passion when he called upon the police in
Montreal, undoubtedly with the thought that he could easily send
you to the penitentiary for twenty years for attempted murder. But
it happened that Antoinette St. Ives was a witness and because of
that his scheme went on the rocks. He could not send you to prison
with a St. Ives giving testimony against him&mdash;at least there
would be serious difficulties in the way. So he will attempt to get
you some other way. And now, if you accept my invitation to join in
what seems to be a hopeless fight against him, he will hate you
more than any other man on the face of the earth, and will not
sleep nights until you are utterly demolished. In the old days,
possessing the power he has now, he would have had you burned at
the stake!"</p>

<p>"Interesting," nodded Clifton, as the other paused. "Consider
that I am a partner in this fight. I have already promised
Mademoiselle Antoinette, and I now promise you. But the manner in
which I am to fight is still a mystery to me, and until you become
a little more specific I shall continue to sweat with suspense. If
you would express yourself a little more clearly about Antoinette
St. Ives&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take a look at this map," said Denis shortly. "We are coming to
that."</p>

<p>Clifton stood at his side and bent over the map on the
table.</p>

<p>"Here is your old friend, the Mistassini River," Denis went on
in a quieter voice. "The concessions of the Laurentian Pulp and
Paper Company are outlined in red&mdash;two thousand square miles
at an approximate cost to us of a thousand dollars a square mile.
Our limits, as you can seen by looking at the scale, reach forty
miles east and west and have a frontage of fifty miles on the
river. Every feeding stream that brings timber out of our territory
empties into the Mistassini. The Mistassini itself is the only road
to Lake Saint John and our mills, which until three years ago were
putting out more than a hundred thousand tons of paper a year. Shut
off the waters of the Mistassini and you stop our life's
blood&mdash;and we die!"</p>

<p>"I begin to understand!" said Clifton. "It's the same old
system, only my father's petty limit was on a stream that wasn't
more than a creek except at flood time&mdash;and Hurd didn't find
it much of a job to take that life's blood away from us. But the
Mistassini&mdash;the greatest stream that comes out of the
north&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Has a carrying limit of five million logs, and not a thousand
more," said Denis. "And our mills require a hundred and fifty
thousand cords of pulpwood annually to run us eighty-five percent
capacity&mdash;and you know that one hundred and fifty thousand
cords of four-foot pulpwood figure up to just five million logs. At
best, crowding every inch of water in the stream and using day and
night of the driving months we can't run our mills more than
eighty-five percent of their capacity. A little graft money, a
little dishonesty, more of politics and less of that Honor and God
which Sir William put up there and we might have had other
concessions&mdash;or at least could have bought protection for our
own. But we are on the Mistassini, and there only, with a
four-million-dollar investment out of which Ivan Hurd has been
slowly but surely choking blood and life. The final smash will come
next spring, in the driving season&mdash;and unless a miracle comes
to save us the Laurentian Pulp and Paper Company will not only turn
over on its side and die but practically all that it ever possessed
will fall into the waiting hands of Ivan Hurd and his grafting
gang."</p>

<p>"You have forgotten Antoinette St. Ives," reminded Clifton.</p>

<p>Colonel Denis placed the tip of his forefinger on a small black
patch almost in the center of the Laurentian concession, and
touching the river.</p>

<p>"For more than a quarter of a century Gautier St. Ives, the
father of Antoinette and Gaspard, was the backbone of all Sir
William's activities in the forests. He was another Sir William,
practical and yet a dreamer, a gentleman and yet a fighting man, a
product of the old school whose ideals have been inherited by his
children. His wife, Antoinette, died when the present Antoinette
was six years old and Gaspard fourteen. I believe I have never seen
anything more terrible than Gautier's grief. It was a quiet grief,
and killed him by inches, in spite of his love for his children. He
died two years after his wife left him, with the request that
Gaspard be induced to enter the priesthood if he could be made to
show a liking for it, and that little Antoinette, then eight years
old, be educated in the Ursuline Convent.</p>

<p>"We tried to follow his wishes, but Gaspard was cut out for
anything but a priest. A number of years before Gautier St. Ives
died Sir William and his partner had deeded over to him&mdash;as a
mark of their gratitude and esteem&mdash;this sub-concession of one
hundred square miles which you see herein in black on the map. It
was a gift of a fortune, of course, but the governors of the
Laurentian Company were of the kind who took pleasure in showing
their appreciation of unusual service. And before Sir William died
he knew that Gaspard, like his father, belonged to the
forests&mdash;so Gaspard took charge of this concession for himself
and his sister, running camps which a year ago numbered more than a
hundred men, and all of his product of pulpwood was bought in by
the Laurentian Company.</p>

<p>"Under this arrangement the St. Ives limits have netted Gaspard
and his sister between ten and fifteen thousand dollars annually,
and the limits have been undercut if anything, for Gaspard loves
trees more than he does people and will only cut timber that is
fully ripe or crippled or seared by fire, which fact makes his
operations somewhat expensive. But he has followed out in practice
the one system of harvesting and conservation which will save our
timber supply of the future, a policy which the Laurentian Company
itself has always followed from the beginning along somewhat less
strict lines. Now you understand one of the ways, and the least
tragic one, in which Antoinette St. Ives is involved in this
life-and-death struggle with Ivan Hurd. Before you can understand
the blacker side of it, and the one which threatens her most, I
must come up to the present situation in my own way. Have you
patience?"</p>

<p>"I am following you closely," said Clifton. "Go on."</p>

<p>"You remember it was Hurd and his associates who first began
pulling off the timberland colonization grafts before you went
away," resumed Denis. "During your absence this scheme has become
so highly organized that it is now one of the greatest menaces that
confront our paper and pulp industry. According to all our
agreements with the Provincial Government any part of our limits
may be set aside at any time for so-called colonization purposes,
and if enough political influence can be brought to bear in a
certain direction the very heart of a concession representing an
investment of millions of dollars can be preempted for 'colonist'
purposes&mdash;and you know how big a chance a 'colonist' has of
making a living in our wild timber country, when each settler can
legally cut only five acres of his timber each year. But the
government does allow him to cut <i>all</i> burned timber, whether
on his land or government land, and so these non-bona-fide settlers
brought in by men like Hurd start forest fires, and within
forty-eight hours they have a vast burned territory in which they
can legally work. They are the pirates of the forests, and not only
give grafters like Hurd an opportunity to get cheap pulpwood but
cause incalculable damage through their incendiarism.</p>

<p>"You know all about this, Clifton. And our first intimation that
Hurd and his gangsters had their eyes on the Laurentian properties
was when we were advised four years ago that two hundred square
miles of our limits had been set aside for 'colonization' purposes.
Of course the 'colonists' came, hired for the purpose, the forest
fires followed, and the Hurd-Foy interests bought the pulpwood,
though it is a matter of record that we offered fifty cents a cord
more for it than they did&mdash;and as a result Hurd had two
hundred thousand logs in the Mistassini that year, cutting down our
drive by just that number.</p>

<p>"Almost simultaneously came our real shock. Options which we had
on eight hundred square miles of timber <i>below</i> us on the
Mistassini, and other options on the Rivi&egrave;re aux Rats were
withheld at expiration by the government, and the properties were
sold to Hurd. It was one of the boldest pieces of political
dishonesty in the history of the Province. But there was no
redress. We were hemmed in. And that spring, three years ago, Hurd
and his interests ran a million and a half logs down the river,
leaving only water enough to carry three and a half million of our
own. That cut our pulp and paper production thirty percent in spite
of all we could do. It was then Hurd offered us&mdash;<i>what</i>?
Half a million dollars for Laurentian properties of six times that
value!"</p>

<p>John Denis's voice trembled and his face was white with
suppressed passion as he paused. He walked back and forth across
the floor, not looking at Clifton.</p>

<p>"Of course we accepted war and ruin instead of alms and
disgrace," he continued, after a moment. "The result was that two
years ago we were cut down to fifty percent of our normal
production, lost an enormous amount of money, and were compelled to
cancel our oldest and most important contract with a New York
publisher who uses seventy acres of forest in each Sunday edition
of his paper. We tried to get help, but our best friends could see
no hope against the handicap of political power that Hurd had
brought against us. Our heavy mill investments were eating us up.
So we did the only thing possible. We wiped a million and a quarter
off our assets, closed our largest mill, and adjusted ourselves to
a secondary rating and an output of two million logs a year. God
knows I'm glad it happened after Sir William died! It would have
broken his heart. And then&mdash;then&mdash;the <i>real
rottenness</i> came out!"</p>

<p>In a moment's silence when Colonel Denis was fiercely lighting
himself a cigar Clifton rose.</p>

<p>"Finish it, John," he said quietly. "I want to walk a little, if
you don't mind&mdash;back and forth here across the room, while you
are giving me the rest of it"&mdash;and his fingers unclenched, and
then drew themselves up again, and his face was almost as white as
that of Sir William's son.</p>

<p>Denis's voice broke into an unnatural laugh.</p>

<p>"Don't allow yourself to become disturbed&mdash;not now,
Clifton! I'm only coming to that part of it which will make your
blood boil, and which has weighed on me until I am no longer fit
either physically or mentally. That is why I thank God you are
here. I need you, if for nothing more than to be near me when the
old ship gives up the ghost and sinks. Again I swear to you I'm not
worrying so much about the money loss. It is the insult of it, the
humiliation, the breaking down of my father's handiwork&mdash;and
Antoinette. I'd willingly give a half of the remaining years of my
life for a little of her faith. God bless her!"</p>

<p>"I encore that," approved Clifton. "But please don't get
sentimental just now, John. You've let this man Hurd get the best
of your nerves, but you're a long way from running up the white
flag or going to the bottom. Cheer up, walk a little as you talk,
whistle between times&mdash;and let's have the rest of it!"</p>

<p>Denis was about to answer when the telephone on his desk began
to ring.</p>

<p>"At this hour! Only Antoinette and St. Ives know I am here!"</p>

<p>He took down the receiver. Clifton watched the expression in the
face slowly change. He could hear an indistinct feminine voice at
the other end of the wire, and during the next two or three minutes
Colonel Denis interrupted it less than half a dozen times and then
only with a word or two. A flush was in his pale cheeks and
dampness of perspiration shone on his forehead when he finished and
turned to Clifton. He smiled but there was a hardness in the twist
of his lips.</p>

<p>"Antoinette St. Ives," he explained tersely. "Ivan Hurd is in
town and has just got word to her. He is to be at her home in half
an hour. Then will come the big explosion, Clifton. Hurd is coming
with his final ultimatum and Antoinette is ready for it. After
their meeting there will be&mdash;hell&mdash;and plenty of it."</p>

<p>The telephone communication seemed to have had an unusual effect
on Colonel Denis. The tension in him had broken and with eyes that
were coldly clear and almost smiling he faced Clifton.</p>

<p>"Rather unexpected," he said, "and&mdash;in a way&mdash;I'm
glad. Hurd is bringing the thing to a head. After tonight there
will be but one road to travel&mdash;and I like it that way. I
never did fancy going over the top in the dark, did you? Always
thought I'd rather go west with the sun shining than be struck by
something hidden and unseen. And Antoinette will see to it that we
have light from now on.</p>

<p>"Curious, too, that it should happen just as I was about to tell
you about her. Maybe it's a lucky omen. That is what she said over
the telephone, and she believed it! I could tell it by her voice.
Her faith in prayer plus that fighting strain which is a part of
her is&mdash;marvelously uplifting. At times it almost convinces me
that we are going to pull out of this hole and that in this girl
Hurd has more than met his match. Excuse me. I must go back to the
point where the telephone interrupted us. Then you will know what
is happening tonight down in the little house in Notre Dame
Street."</p>

<p>He placed his finger again on the dark little patch on the
map.</p>

<p>"When he wiped out almost a half of our assets and thus prepared
ourselves to accept the inevitable, with a production of two
million logs instead of five each year, Hurd was shot off his
balance. He had not expected that, but had figured we would go down
to ruin before making such a move. As it was, having accepted our
loss in advance, we were in a position to carry on a sound but much
smaller business&mdash;and Hurd could not salvage our concessions
until we were literally against the wall. He set about finding
other ways of putting us there, and hit upon the St. Ives
sub-limits. He knew that if he could get possession of these he
would have us by the throats as he would then be located in the
very heart of our property.</p>

<p>"So he offered Gaspard St. Ives as much for his two hundred
square miles as he had offered us for our two thousand&mdash;a
quarter of a million dollars! Think of it,
Clifton!&mdash;twenty-five hundred dollars a square mile, more than
Antoinette and her brother could expect to get out of it in a
lifetime. Of course it was refused. It was then Ivan Hurd first met
Antoinette. It isn't difficult for you to guess what happened. From
that hour the beast was possessed by a passion that overrode all
his other ambitions. He was clever enough to begin with apparent
decency, if you can call a proposal of marriage at the end of the
second week of a rather cool acquaintanceship decent&mdash;"</p>

<p>Clifton chuckled.</p>

<p>"Forgive me for interrupting you, John. I am tense, I am mad, I
am ready to choke the life out of Ivan Hurd&mdash;but I must recall
your attention to the fact that I didn't wait two weeks to tell
Mademoiselle St. Ives what Hurd told her. I am quite sure I
declared my love for her within the first hour&mdash;immediately
after coming from her vaporarium. If Hurd wasn't decent what in
Heaven's name was I?"</p>

<p>"Rather&mdash;indiscreet, I should say," replied Colonel Denis.
"I am wondering you are not a rag. Antoinette must have a splendid
opinion of you to let you get away with a thing like that. But of
course she saw the difference. Hurd came to her from out of a
reptilian age, and I guess she let him know it. She let him
understand clearly how she despised him.</p>

<p>"But Hurd wasn't the kind of man to let go once he had set his
heart on a thing. It was his nature to ride over obstacles as a
steel tank goes through entanglements and over trenches.
Antoinette's refusal and resentment merely served to increase his
madness for her. He wasn't thinking of love, not on her part. That
she hated him made no difference, unless it still more increased
his desire and determination to possess her. He wanted her body and
her beauty, and I believe that in this very hour down in Notre Dame
Street he would turn over half his great fortune for those
things.</p>

<p>"Along with his millions and his name he offered to give up his
fight against the Laurentian Company and to turn over to it without
cost all his grafted limits in our territory. He made this offer
directly to me with the hope that I might help to influence
Antoinette St. Ives. When he finally realized that nothing he
possessed could possibly count with her he reverted to his
type&mdash;the jungle beast. He had cornered us, and he began his
schemes to corner her. If he could not buy her he would trap
her&mdash;force her into giving her body to him no matter where her
heart and soul might be. And to do this he began by bringing about
one of the most contemptible pieces of civic legislation in the
province.</p>

<p>"You know how Antoinette and her brother love the memories of
what few stones and hallowed places are left of the ancient days
when the pioneers of New France started a world over here? It is
almost a religion with them. Their one ambition in making money is
to save a few of the things that are going into ruin, and which in
another quarter-century will have become only memories of the past.
Hurd, discovering this, had painted visions of what his money could
do, but even this lure failed to buy the soul of Antoinette St.
Ives. She told me once that she would willingly give up her life to
bring about the things she dreamed of but that her soul was not her
own and she could not sacrifice it to an eternal damnation.</p>

<p>"Then Hurd, the jungle fiend, sprung his first trap on
Antoinette, just as he had previously sprung one on the Laurentian
Company. His agents worked with the slyness of foxes. He bought up
a million dollars' worth of property in and about Quebec, including
almost every historical point that could be purchased, and through
his political influence had Notre Dame Street, Sous le Cap Street,
Little Champlain and Cul-de-Sac <i>condemned</i>, and now owns
practically every foot of them. In this scheme, of 'civic
improvement' the St. Ives home must go with the others. And with
it, and the disruption of those little streets, go the dreams, the
heart and the happiness of Antoinette St. Ives. There is only one
way in which she can save them&mdash;give herself to Hurd!"</p>

<p>He stopped, and his eyes met Clifton's. Each knew what lay
behind the cold and quiet tenseness of the other's silence.</p>

<p>"And now," finished Denis after that interval of stillness, "you
know why this is not entirely a fight for the salvation of the
Laurentian Pulp and Paper Company. It is a fight that goes to the
heart of two hundred years ago&mdash;to the life and happiness and
honor of a beautiful girl&mdash;to the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>John Denis slowly clenched and unclenched the fingers of his
hands.</p>

<p>"If it happens&mdash;as Hurd has planned it&mdash;Antoinette St.
Ives will be another Am&eacute;lie de Repentigny. For Gaspard St.
Ives will kill Ivan Hurd, and his sister will offer up her life for
the salvation of his soul&mdash;by becoming a nun!"</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed Clifton. "She would do that?"</p>

<p>"With her brother as a witness she has made that pledge before
the crucifix of Adelaide Marrolet. It is the only thing that has
thus far held back Gaspard St. Ives. If it was not for Antoinette's
oath to the Virgin Mother Ivan Hurd would be as good as dead, and
Gaspard would be forever gone into the big forests north&mdash;or
at least until his love for his sister brought him back where the
law could get him. It is this thought of what St. Ives may do that
frightens me. He is like a man born two hundred years ago living
over into this age. His ideals of honor are the warp and woof of
his heart, and if Ivan Hurd wins and smashes us all and levels that
little place in Notre Dame Street&mdash;I do not think that even
his sister's pledge will hold Gaspard back.</p>

<p>"She is afraid of that, too. Of course the thought of going into
the cloistered convent of the Ursulines holds no horror for her,
although she loves life. It is merely a beautiful renunciation,
like that made by Am&eacute;lie de Repentigny. That is why Friar
Alphonse never leaves Gaspard. Tonight you thought he had left you
at the entrance to Notre Dame Street, but he was back again before
you entered the St. Ives home. He is always within the call of
Antoinette St. Ives and will see that Gaspard is kept out of Hurd's
way."</p>

<p>Clinton was pacing back and forth across the room again, and his
thoughts were running more wildly than his blood. "If St. Ives
should kill Hurd&mdash;you think Antoinette would keep her
promise?"</p>

<p>"Only death would stop her."</p>

<p>"And St. Ives knows this?"</p>

<p>"Even better than I."</p>

<p>Something dropped from Clifton's lips which was unintelligible
to Denis. "Then he would kill Hurd&mdash;<i>knowing that</i>?" he
demanded savagely. "He would deliberately send her into convent
walls&mdash;just to ease a passion?"</p>

<p>An almost gentle smile came into the face of John Denis.</p>

<p>"Not to ease a passion, Clifton. Not that. But to <i>right a
wrong</i>&mdash;that would be St. Ives's way of looking at it. It
is the old blood in him&mdash;something you cannot stop&mdash;the
thing which impelled his forefathers to come out at dawn down there
in Lower Town to adjust their grievances in an honorable way at the
rapier point. For months Gaspard has been fighting against his
desire. Days and weeks at a time he tramps the highways. On his
knees he has entreated his sister to take back her pledge and allow
him to right this trouble as he thinks a man should right it. It
has brought distress into the heart of a sweet girl up at Saint
F&eacute;licien, Angelique Fanchon&mdash;whom Gaspard loves, and
who has also made a pledge&mdash;that if Gaspard so much as lays a
hand on Ivan Hurd she will marry a man named Ajax
Trappier&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So that's it!" interrupted Clifton. "John, how the light does
begin to dawn upon me! And I see only one way out of this
trouble&mdash;only one."</p>

<p>"And that?"</p>

<p>"I must kill Ivan Hurd myself!"</p>

<p>He laughed and there was a note of wild and almost joyous
abandon in his voice.</p>

<p>Denis put a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"That is the old voice, Clifton&mdash;with the ring of the days
in it when I, too, was a whole man and not a half of one, and God
knows I've wanted to hear such a voice a long time! You
know&mdash;and I know&mdash;that you will not kill Ivan Hurd unless
necessity and justice both demand it. Since I learned you were
alive new hope has begun to burn in me. Canada has never had
another man of the forests like you and my Grandfather Denis. With
you up in the Laurentian woods, with your knowledge and skill as a
forester, your fighting qualities and your ability to make men love
and respect you&mdash;all pitted against Ivan Hurd and his
forces&mdash;I still see the possibility of triumph in what until
now has only been tragedy and defeat.</p>

<p>"Gaspard St. Ives is no longer dependable in this situation as a
leader in the woods, and I have no other man capable of fending the
final smash. I cannot do it myself. Physically I have been unfit
for a year, and I have no great influence with men as you have. And
that is what will triumph up there, if anything triumphs. For
Hurd's last assault, which will begin this coming winter and reach
its climax in the spring, will be nothing short of robbery, murder
and piracy. It was Antoinette who learned his plans, and we already
begin to see the working of them.</p>

<p>"Labor trouble has come like disease into our mills through his
endeavors. He has brought discord among men we have employed in the
woods for years. From the States and other parts of this province
he is importing a horde of men to work out his ends who are little
better than outlaws. He has tried and is still trying to subsidize
the Church&mdash;to buy the influence of certain priests and
parishes through gifts and promises and a widespread propaganda of
falsehood about ourselves. He has begun the building of certain
dams to flood us out&mdash;and is deliberately setting our forests
on fire.</p>

<p>"This winter and next spring the hell will break loose. He will
have in the woods five hundred men of the worst type ever brought
together under one organization, and we shall be compelled to use
the same roads, the same bridges and the same portages with this
hired banditry. There can be only one way to meet it, man to man,
bullet for bullet if necessary. We have law and justice on our
side&mdash;Ivan Hurd has political power and prestige.
And&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, as if to give force to his next words. "This may
shock you, Clifton. Antoinette St. Ives says this is no longer a
man's job&mdash;<i>but a woman's</i>! It is her scheme, her plans,
her ideas and spirit that we are going to follow in the final hours
of our struggle with Hurd. That is why it was she, and not I, who
was having that conference with Ivan Hurd when you came to his
office in Montreal. Hurd had purposely given publicity to the lie
that he was about to leave for Europe, thinking it would bring us
to our knees more quickly, and Mademoiselle St. Ives was there in a
last effort to bring about peace. Hurd asked her to step into the
adjoining room while he had his word with you. Fate could not have
arranged the situation better&mdash;and as a result Antoinette
wants you to accompany her on a certain life-and-death expedition
which leaves the city of Quebec for the north country day after
tomorrow in the morning. How about it, Captain Brant? That is the
story&mdash;all of it. Are you willing to fight at the side of this
Jeanne d'Arc of ours?"</p>

<p>"Until I die," said Clifton in a low voice. "<i>Until I
die.</i>"</p>

<p>He had taken his hat, and now placed it on his head. Then he
looked at his watch, and held out a hand to Colonel Denis.</p>

<p>"If Ivan Hurd has kept his appointment promptly he has now been
fifteen minutes with Mademoiselle St. Ives," he said in a coldly
unemotional voice. "I think I should like to be down there, Colonel
Denis. I should like to pass the little place once or twice during
their conference, and I should like to meet him face to face as he
comes out at the end of Notre Dame Street. Good night!"</p>

<p>"Good night!" said Colonel Denis.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>Impelled by a great desire for action and by a fear of what
might be happening in Notre Dame Street Clifton lost only a little
time in descending to Lower Town. The miles he had walked that day
seemed to have left no effect of exhaustion and every nerve and
muscle in him was alert and sleepless.</p>

<p>The Frontenac orchestra was playing its final evening number on
the Terrace and for a moment he paused to listen to it as he leaned
over the dizzy height between him and the roofs of Lower Town. The
thought came to him suddenly that he had stumbled out of earthly
existence into something unreal and too beautiful to last long, a
land of Prester John, a kingdom of Micomicon, a world made out of
the dream of Alnaschar and filled with thick-coming visions and
fancies. The music came to him softly, floating between the earth
and sky, for a half of the world lay below him. Its lights burned
with a velvety radiance so far away that in places they were like
scattered stars.</p>

<p>He saw the little streets, so directly under him that he could
have tossed a stone upon the roofs, and the faint glow of light
that came out of narrow windows broke the darkness for him and made
deeper patches of shadow in between. Flame-like points of light
gleamed upon the great river; many of them were moving and some
were still; a French warship lay where Cartier's tiny ship had
moored itself for the first time in this new world three hundred
and ninety-one years ago, and the lanterns of a British destroyer
burned their signals where Champlain had first set his foot in the
name of God and the King of France. Somebody was singing down in
the mystic gloom and distance. It was a woman's voice rising very
faintly toward the stars. There were millions of these stars above
him and never had they seemed so bright or so large or so filled
with the radiance of glory and promise.</p>

<p>He walked down Mountain Hill and the Break-Neck Stairs with the
music growing fainter behind him, and with each step that he took
the truth overwhelmed him still more and told him that it was in
himself that the mighty change had come, and that because of it the
world had leaped suddenly out of its drabness and sameness, and
life was a new thing&mdash;thrilling him, crowding him with its
closeness and stirring his heart and body and soul.</p>

<p>He laughed to himself from the sheer joy of what had come to
him. As confession and acknowledgment swept upon him he thought of
Benedict and Clairette Aldous and of the inanity and sheer
inconsequence of man until touched by this miracle of love. For he
loved Antoinette St. Ives. He kept repeating it like a wordless and
voiceless song in his heart. It was more than love. It was a kind
of worship. It was something which he had never dreamed could come
to any man, though he had never denied love and its glory&mdash;in
an ordinarily earthly way. But this was different. He told himself
that, while his feet and his soul were treading enchanted ground.
Then it occurred to him that Benedict must have felt like this, and
Clairette Aldous, and Am&eacute;lie de Repentigny&mdash;away back
through the ages so far as true love went. The thought brought him
back to earth&mdash;and his feet to Notre Dame Street.</p>

<p>He walked past Antoinette's home and saw the warm glow of light
within as he had left it an hour ago. Hurd was probably there. He
turned and paused for a moment in front of the windows. What would
happen if he went in? His blood was filled with that
desire&mdash;to stand face to face with Hurd again and to let him
know as quickly as he could that it was to be a fight to the death
now between himself and the murderer of his father. He walked on,
going to the end of the street, and a dispassionate coolness began
to possess him. He felt an immense confidence&mdash;and at the same
time the necessity for caution and a deliberate command of
himself.</p>

<p>They would beat Ivan Hurd! Not for an instant did a doubt of
that fact oppress him. If it came to the worst he held the final
key, the final solution. Hurd owed him a life in exchange for his
father's, and it would not be so terribly hard to collect the
debt&mdash;with the heart and happiness of Antoinette St. Ives
dependent upon its fulfilment.</p>

<p>A third and a fourth time he walked past her door and windows,
treading softly so that his feet made no sound, and he began
turning over in his mind what the plans might be that were taking
her into the north country. Colonel Denis would probably have
explained if he had waited a little longer&mdash;but tomorrow would
do. A <i>woman's</i> job! He thought again of Clairette Aldous and
smiled in the gloom that lay between the narrow walls. The same
pluck was in them both, and it was a more beautiful courage than
man's. When he found himself saying that, half aloud, it was like
an arrow driving into him where the light of wisdom had never found
its way before.</p>

<p>Twice he had seen a shadowy figure at the end of the street and
each time it had disappeared at his approach. Now he observed it a
third time, and again it was swallowed up in gloom as he came
toward it, as if one of the old walls had opened and let it in. It
was late and most people were asleep. Few lights were burning
beyond the windows and stillness hung heavily in the little streets
of Lower Town. And at this hour, Clifton thought, no one would be
appearing and disappearing in that ghostly way unless he was a spy
or some evil lay behind it. He recalled Colonel Denis's words
regarding the little monk and wondered if it was Friar Alphonse who
had also made this a night of vigil in Notre Dame Street.</p>

<p>The stillness was broken by the opening and closing of a door.
The sound was like a pistol shot in the little street, sharp and
with something of dramatic harshness about it.</p>

<p>It was the St. Ives door.</p>

<p>Clifton flattened himself against one of the walls. His position
was good. Light shone in from the end of the street and Hurd would
easily recognize him when he stepped forth.</p>

<p>He could hear Hurd's feet pounding heavily, like an animal's.
That, and the slamming of the door, convinced him of the passion of
the man. He sauntered out from the wall as Hurd came up. They met
face to face with scarcely the reach of an arm between them.</p>

<p>Hurd's face had a strange look in it. His eyes were flaming. His
full, heavy lips hung a little loosely and he was breathing shortly
and quickly. Something that was more than passion&mdash;a touch
almost of madness&mdash;seemed to have hold of the man. The instant
he recognized Clifton a hand shot to his pocket. There it stopped,
gripping something tightly.</p>

<p>Clifton smiled coldly into his eyes.</p>

<p>"We're not in the woods yet, Hurd," he admonished. "Better not
shoot! Leave that kind of work to your hired assassins&mdash;only
I'd advise you to get better ones than you had at Haipoong."</p>

<p>He gave Hurd no chance to reply.</p>

<p>"I've been waiting for you," he went on. "I want to tell you
that I realize what a fool I was for not killing you in your office
in Montreal. You owe me your life, and I'm going to have it. This
time I am not playing with you. I am going to kill you&mdash;but
not here. I am going to give you one chance&mdash;only
one&mdash;and you'd better take it. If you do not, all your
political power won't save you. I want you to understand that,
Hurd&mdash;I'll kill you anywhere, in the woods, on the street, in
your own home&mdash;if you go on with your plot against the
Laurentian Company and Antoinette St. Ives!"</p>

<p>His voice was like ice, but in the face of it Hurd had recovered
his nerve. His grinning teeth leered at Clifton. He laughed with
low savagery. In a moment he was <i>Le Taureau</i>&mdash;the
Bull&mdash;the human steam-roller preparing to ride over his
enemies.</p>

<p>"You fool!" he snapped, thrusting his huge shoulders forward.
"No, I won't shoot. I'll wait. I'll break you into little bits, an
inch at a time. I'm glad the police didn't get you, for that would
have been too good for you&mdash;too good!" The bones of his
fingers snapped in their clenching tenseness. "You
miserable&mdash;bluffer!"</p>

<p>He made as if to pass but Clifton stood in his way.</p>

<p>"Are you not a trifle curious, Hurd?" he asked. "Are you so
demoralized by your conference with Mademoiselle St. Ives that you
do not want to know why I am going to kill you unless you put an
end to the scheming deviltry through which you hope to force her
into your possession?"</p>

<p>A momentary shock of amazement touched Hurd.</p>

<p>"What do you know&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do I know?" interrupted Clifton. "Everything. And why
shouldn't I, inasmuch as I am going to make Antoinette St. Ives my
wife? Now you understand why it will be so easy for me to kill
you!" And with these words he left Hurd.</p>

<p>His blood ran hot as he walked again up through the gloom of
Notre Dame Street. No power could have kept the words back from his
lips. He wanted Hurd to know, and he was glad he had spoken them.
Yet his heart was frightened and his soul trembled as he came
nearer to the door of Antoinette St. Ives.</p>

<p>For a moment Ivan Hurd stared after him and then crunched
fiercely out through the mouth of the street.</p>

<p>As he disappeared Friar Alphonse came from his hiding-place
within a dozen feet of where the two men had stood. Doubling
himself over so that he became more than ever a part of the shadows
he followed on the trail of Ivan Hurd.</p>

<p>For only a moment Clifton hesitated before the St. Ives door.
Then he knocked, and entered the little vestibule. He tapped at the
second door, and waited. He heard light footsteps and after that
fell a silence in which he could hear his heart beating.</p>

<p>"It is Captain Brant who knocks, Mademoiselle," he called
reassuringly.</p>

<p>The door was slowly opened.</p>

<p>After Ivan Hurd's visit he had expected to find Antoinette St.
Ives with flaming cheeks and eyes filled with fire. She was that
kind of little fighter, he believed&mdash;one who would die before
showing the white flag of fear to her enemy. Her appearance now was
something of a shock to him. She was deathly white&mdash;so white
that the curling richness of her hair seemed to rest with almost
metallic weight against her bloodless cheeks and forehead. Her eyes
were luminous pools of a strange light which he had not seen in
them before, and he could see a little throbbing place in her white
throat as she faced him. In the mute tragedy of her whiteness and
with that heart beating in her throat she was lovelier to Clifton
than when he had first seen her at the top of the stair. Yet there
was something frightening about this beauty now. It was as if it
had turned suddenly to snow, even to the hand that had risen to her
breast as he entered. His impulse was not to let her know he saw
the change in her, to pass over it if he could and to bring the
rose flush of blood back into her face with the boundless optimism
of his own confidence and strength.</p>

<p>So he said: "Pardon, Mademoiselle. It is late, but I could not
sleep until I saw you again. I think Colonel Denis has told me most
of the story. He is upset&mdash;tremendously so. A little off
physically, I should say, and overworried, especially about you.
That is why I came back&mdash;to make sure your mind was not
unsettled for the night. I met our old friend Hurd in the
alley&mdash;I mean in the street. Had a nice little chat with him.
An unconscionable scoundrel and a hopeless ass, isn't he? Hurd is a
type. I met them in the war. They are the same everywhere&mdash;in
business as well as behind the gun. There is only one way of
handling them, and I am glad I happened to come home with that
method fresh in my mind. Please don't worry,
Mademoiselle&mdash;Antoinette."</p>

<p>He dared the last word&mdash;her name. It was the only thing
that came a little unsteadily from his lips. And he noticed that
the pallor was beginning to go out of her cheeks.</p>

<p>"You are thoughtful, Captain Brant. And you are quite sure
Colonel Denis left nothing untold?"</p>

<p>"I am quite sure&mdash;except that I did not wait for the
details of the plan which is taking you into the north. I think he
told me everything&mdash;even to your vow to consecrate yourself to
the Church should your brother destroy Ivan Hurd. Such a thing will
never be necessary, Mademoiselle. From this night on Ivan Hurd
belongs to me. I told him that in our brief conversation out there,
and the entirely satisfactory part of it all is that Hurd knows
it!"</p>

<p>He was ready to go then. It was enough to have seen her and to
have said this much. He inclined his head as if to say good
night.</p>

<p>Her hand touched him. It rested on his arm and the feathery
weight of it thrilled him. The heart-like little beat in her throat
was gone. Her eyes shone for a moment with the softness of dawn
breaking through a mist of morning dew, and almost unconsciously
his hand rose and touched her own as it rested on his arm. She drew
away.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said, "I had to do that&mdash;or touch your
hair."</p>

<p>She ignored his words, as if he had not touched her or spoken.
And he was looking at her hair, its shining beauty, its softness
and its tempting nearness.</p>

<p>She made a little gesture with her hands.</p>

<p>"You, too, would kill Ivan Hurd?"</p>

<p>"If your life and happiness depends on his death&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"But it isn't necessary!" she cried with a sudden passionate
break in her voice. "It is not Ivan Hurd I am afraid of. He can
destroy, he can drive us out of the forests, he can break up this
home, he can do his worst and still there is life. It is my
brother&mdash;Gaspard&mdash;who fills me with fear. There is a
madness in him which frightens me. If Hurd goes on I know what will
happen. It will end in&mdash;in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," said Clifton. "John Denis told me. But it is not going
to end that way. I am answering for your brother now. We are going
north, and I am wagering twenty to one that we will beat Hurd on
his own ground. As for your brother&mdash;I can give you the
greatest guarantee in the world that he will never injure this man
he hates."</p>

<p>Relief filled her face. His own assurance rose as he saw it
flooding her eyes with a radiant glow. Lightsomeness swept his
heart. It was impossible for him to see tragedy or even the shadow
of tragedy. For him the world was a glory of hope, and he smiled
his optimism and faith and happiness in her face that was suffused
once more with a soft flush of color.</p>

<p>"The beast frightened you tonight?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It was unpleasant."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;it was final?"</p>

<p>"Yes, final."</p>

<p>"Then let us cheer up, <i>cara sposa</i>! That is a perfectly
proper Hindu luck-name for one who has courage, pluck,
determination and a great faith in prayer. It is extremely formal
and I hope you don't mind my using it. <i>Cara sposa</i>! It is
almost as pretty as Antoinette, and means so much, and the
higher-caste Hindus believe it never fails to bring good luck when
applied to one with all the sincerity of another's heart. You see I
am a little superstitious. And now if you will go to bed and dream
of nothing but sunshine and success&mdash;and possibly of
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>The humor in his eyes was infectious. She smiled. Her shining
head was near him when she said good night.</p>

<p>"I am glad you came back," she said; and he went away repeating
those words&mdash;"I am glad you came back&mdash;<i>I am glad you
came back</i>"&mdash;until his brain seemed to have heard no others
since the beginning of the world.</p>

<p>From the end of the street someone watched as the night
swallowed him, a bent and silent figure that was a part of the
shadows. It was Friar Alphonse. A few minutes later he stood under
the light in front of the St. Ives home. His mouth was twisted as
if in pain. A look of grief was in his eyes. With an effort he
seemed to shake himself, and straightened his shoulders, and forced
a smile to his tense lips.</p>

<p>"God's will be done!" he muttered, and still like a shadow he
disappeared through the door which a few moments before Antoinette
St. Ives had closed upon Clifton.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p>It was after midnight when Clifton ceased walking and got
himself a room. Even then it was not with the intention of
immediately going to bed or trying to sleep. He bought a paper and
cigars and explained quite plausibly to the hotel clerk why he had
no luggage. The missing pack, of which Gaspard had taken
possession, emphasized the general upsetting and bewildering
readjustment of the entire universe during the last few hours.</p>

<p>The pack, now in the St. Ives home, was an unmistakable proof
that at first Gaspard and his sister had planned to keep him there
as a guest. But he remembered that nothing had been said about it
when he left with Colonel Denis. Of course an unexpected thing had
happened after that&mdash;the surprise visit of Ivan Hurd.
Otherwise Denis would undoubtedly have escorted him back to Notre
Dame Street. And Ivan Hurd had not produced the only shock in the
St. Ives household that night! His visit must have been
immeasurably less astonishing than this own attitude toward
Antoinette St. Ives, and after what he had said to her it was of
course inconceivable that she could think of him as a guest. She
had even forgotten the pack which contained his belongings when she
knew he was leaving for other lodging.</p>

<p>Clifton felt no regret. He was filled with a glowing exultation
and happiness which persisted in keeping him wide awake and he was
glad he had given voice to a daring truth instead of hiding it.
That Antoinette St. Ives was thinking of him as impertinent and
over-bold, even when regarding his action in a most charitable way,
made no difference. He was glad for all that, glad the truth was
out. And each hour and day she would know more and more that it was
the truth he had spoken, and if God would only be with him a little
he would prove to her in the end that they had never been strangers
but that he had been waiting for her from the beginning of
time&mdash;<i>yes, ever since that day long ago when she was the
lovely Adelaide and he was Crepin Marrolet</i>.</p>

<p>That thought ran through him so sharply that it brought a little
gasp to his lips. <i>Why not</i>? Had he not lived before&mdash;in
all his dreams, his thoughts, his wide-awake visions of a day and
age that had preceded this? Was it not thinkable that he was that
Crepin Marrolet who was brought in dead from a duel, and that it
was Antoinette living in the body of Adelaide who had wept over him
and died of grief three years later? Yes, it was
thinkable&mdash;believable&mdash;it was so! If he could only tell
her that&mdash;if he could let her know that it was Crepin who had
come back to fight for her out of that life which they had both
lived and loved so many years ago!</p>

<p>He pulled out a drawer, and there was paper. He began to
write&mdash;not to Antoinette St. Ives but to Adelaide Marrolet. It
was his soul that burned in the words, his love, his faith, his
belief, his religion. He did not read them when he had finished.
His face was hot with the fever of this thoughts, this miracle of
revelation that had come to him, as he sealed and addressed the
envelope. Now he knew what the open skies and the stars and the
voiceless glory of nature had been trying to tell him all these
years of his earthly wandering. He had been
questing&mdash;seeking&mdash;and at last he had found that for
which he had sought, that treasure which he had lost for a time at
the end of a rapier point two hundred and forty-nine years ago. And
Antoinette St. Ives must know!</p>

<p>He went down and got a messenger. And after that he paced back
and forth in his room, looking at his watch, counting the steps
that must be taken, until he knew that his message had reached
her.</p>

<p>He did not feel that he had done an insane or foolish thing. Now
that he had acted he tried to recall what he had written. It would
amaze her, of course. At first she might think he was a little mad,
and he could fancy her getting very angry, too. But she could not
escape the truth that was in those pages. By this time she was up
and was reading or had read what he had sent. He made his vision of
her, all in lacy white, with her silken curls about her shoulders
and the pages of his letter in her lap. What if she should think he
was mad? A little stab of uneasiness went through him.
Shell-shocked, gassed&mdash;afflicted with hypochondriasis, or
dithyrambisis, maybe. He grinned. If he had thought of those words
he would have used them. They would have been incontestable proof
of his sanity.</p>

<p>It was three o'clock when he partly undressed and stretched
himself out on the bed. It was not his intention to take more than
a cat-nap if he slept at all. Joe and Bim were arriving at
seven-thirty in the morning and probably Antoinette would be at the
depot to meet them. He, also, would be there. It would be a
splendid opportunity, and he could take them all to breakfast. He
closed his eyes and firmly adjusted his mind upon a five o'clock
awakening. He was confident as drowsiness stole over him. He was
like an alarm clock, and when he set himself to awake at a certain
hour it always happened.</p>

<p>But this morning there was an error somewhere in the mechanics
of the system. It was ten o'clock when he looked at his watch. A
high sun was pouring in at a window and a newsboy was calling out
the noon edition of a paper.</p>

<p>He leaped from the bed in a panic. It was eleven o'clock before
he had a shave and was in Notre Dame Street. Of course it was
excusable for him to call there to see Joe and Bim. Antoinette
would almost expect that.</p>

<p>As he knocked at the door he wished he had stopped somewhere to
take a cup of coffee. He might need it, facing her this morning. He
felt a little taggy. His nerves were not as steady as they should
have been, and his heart was not pumping as strongly as last night.
Afraid? His confidence a little gone? He shook himself and laughed
the thought away. There was no answer to his knocking. He tried the
outer door and found it locked, and then pommeled it more loudly.
It was impossible for him to rouse an answer. He went down to the
market, killed half an hour, and returned again. Still he could get
no answer. Then he hunted up a telephone and persisted in that way.
Funny he could not even get the maid!</p>

<p>It was almost noon when he went to Colonel Denis's office. Denis
had evidently been awaiting him with some anxiety, for a look of
unconcealed relief came into his face when Clifton entered.</p>

<p>"I was beginning to wonder if something had happened to you,
too," he greeted. "Guess I'm in rotten shape. My nerves won't
adjust themselves to the unexpected. Glad you've come, Clifton!
There is your pack over there, and I have two letters for
you&mdash;one from Antoinette and the other from Gaspard. The
devil, but I thought maybe Hurd had got you!"</p>

<p>Clifton controlled his uneasiness.</p>

<p>"I overslept," he explained. "Then I went down to Notre Dame
Street and could find no one there."</p>

<p>"They're gone!" shrugged Denis. "You never can tell exactly what
Antoinette St. Ives is going to do&mdash;and she has done it again,
if that makes me clear. She left by rail early this morning for
Metabetchewan up on Lake Saint John, instead of taking the really
beautiful water trip on a Saguenay boat. Don't know what started
her so suddenly, but her brother and the monk are with her, and
also the boy and dog. The <i>dog</i>, mind you! Can you beat it?
And&mdash;can you tell me any more about it than she told me in the
note which I found here this morning?"</p>

<p>"Probably less. You say you have letters for me?"</p>

<p>Denis gave him two envelopes that were on his desk. One was
effeminately small and sealed with wax. Clifton opened it first.
The handwriting was as exquisite as Antoinette St. Ives
herself.</p>

<p>"If it were not that I need the assistance of a man of your
experience and age I would be inclined to ask you not to follow us
to Metabetchewan," she had written. "But your years soften the
voluminous audacity of your letter, all of which I have not yet had
time to read&mdash;and I doubt if I shall find the leisure to
continue through so many words which seem to carry such a pitifully
small expression of idea. I think we shall be at Metabetchewan for
a day or two before leaving on the pilgrimage which Colonel Denis
can tell you about. As one who wishes you well, however, I might
suggest that you go to a psychopathic hospital first, at least for
an examination if not for treatment." And then she added, "With
good wishes for your health, Antoinette St. Ives."</p>

<p>Clifton was sallow when he turned to Colonel Denis.</p>

<p>"She says nothing," he mumbled.</p>

<p>He opened Gaspard's letter.</p>

<p>"My beloved sister has us running in circles with the
unexpectedness of her departure," he wrote briefly. "This is only
to call attention to your promise, Monsieur&mdash;that you are to
be with God and me when I break the bones in Ajax Trappier's body.
If you will come to Metabetchewan we will immediately make our
plans."</p>

<p>Clifton felt better.</p>

<p>"I am to follow them on the next train. When does that
leave?"</p>

<p>"Day after tomorrow," said Denis.</p>

<p>Clifton's heart fell like a chunk of lead.</p>

<p>"Not until then? No other way?"</p>

<p>"Not unless you walk through several hundred miles of
wilderness." Suddenly Denis caught himself. "By George, Lucien
Jeannot telephoned me not half an hour ago! Jeannot is one of the
government hydroplane fliers who are mapping the northern timber
country. His station is at Roberval on Lake Saint John, and he is
flying back sometime early this afternoon. If you'd care to go that
way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Care!</i>" Clifton fairly shouted the word. "For God's sake
get hold of him and make it possible for me if you can, John! If I
had it I would give a million dollars to be waiting at that little
old Metabetchewan station when Antoinette St. Ives gets off the
train! Where is Jeannot? Can you reach him? Will he take
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Denis was already at the telephone. Within ten minutes he had
located Jeannot at the government offices. Yes, Jeannot would be
glad to take Monsieur Brant. He would like his company. He was
leaving at two o'clock.</p>

<p>Clifton emitted a groan of joy as he sank into a chair.</p>

<p>"Don't mind my emotion," he begged. "I am eager to be on the
scene of battle. And I am confident, John&mdash;never was so sure
of a thing in my life. We are going to beat Hurd. And you have
until two o'clock to tell me many things I ought to know. First,
what are the working plans that Mademoiselle St. Ives has
proposed?"</p>

<p>Colonel Denis had prepared himself for that explanation. He had
maps, papers and blue-prints laid out on the table and began where
Clifton had interrupted him the preceding night. First he pointed
out the positions of dams, bridges and roads and the locations of
camps. It was like going over a battlefield. The blue-prints
contained their enemy's possessions, and Clifton could easily see
the drama of the situation. They were not only working on the same
river with their foes, but shoulder to shoulder with them, in many
instances using the same roads and bridges.</p>

<p>"We have seen a lot of fighting together, Clifton," said John
Denis, "and with the battleground laid out before us like this we
should at once recognize that one chance upon which our salvation
depends. Here the conflicting forces will meet. Victory or ruin, as
I see it now, will rest entirely upon superiority in manpower, but
not so much in the strength of that manpower in numbers as in
morale. Hurd has a great advantage of us now. His forces are
organized, his machine oiled and working smoothly, not because of
love or loyalty but by reason of unlimited money behind it. Our
forces are broken, scattered and undermined by his agents and his
propaganda and his promise of bonuses.</p>

<p>"He is an atheist and at heart hates Catholicism yet he has
contributed money to a dozen parishes and has built a dozen shrines
in the Lake Saint John country, where we are dependent for our men.
If the Church could be convinced of his heart and his purpose I am
sure it would repudiate his gifts and his influence, but by the
time it has made that discovery Hurd will have achieved his ends.
That is why Antoinette St. Ives has risen like a Jeanne d'Arc to
take charge of the situation.</p>

<p>"She believes that women will see the truth where men have
failed, and that what we must have in the woods this year are
friends. So she is going north to make them&mdash;to meet the wives
and children of the forest men as well as the men themselves, to
live with them, and scatter the seeds of truth and loyalty where
Hurd and his people have sown their poison. It is not selfishness
that urges her, Clifton. She loves the people she is going among.
She knows many of them. She worships the forests. It is a labor of
love and justice and service to God she is on far more than that of
her own welfare&mdash;those things and to save her brother from
what she knows will happen if Ivan Hurd completes the devastation
he has begun."</p>

<p>Clifton saw him hesitate.</p>

<p>"And that is all?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," said Denis. "A few of the men will be leaving their homes
for the woods late this month, and most of them will go during
September and October. Antoinette is going to spend the winter with
them in their camps and remain until the driving season closes
after the flood waters of spring. It took me a long time to approve
of that, but I had to, for she was determined on the adventure
whether I gave it official sanction or not. There is a danger about
it, too, for Hurd now understands what her intentions are and he
has the toughest crowd in the Province up there&mdash;a crowd that
will grow worse as winter comes. And she is going in among that
crowd. I cannot stop her. It is her intention to meet Hurd's
ruffians in Hurd's own camps, become acquainted with them, sing for
them, give them little talks on Sundays, and make them ashamed of
their fight against a woman.</p>

<p>"A fascinatingly courageous program, don't you think?&mdash;no
less an idea than driving Hurd out of his own household through the
sheer force of decency and respect which she hopes to rouse in the
better element of that horde which Hurd will have under the
leadership of his professional bad men. Maybe it will work. Maybe
it won't. If it doesn't, or if something should happen to
her&mdash;then is when I want you to be ready to fight in another
way.</p>

<p>"You are to have full authority over the men. Mademoiselle St.
Ives has agreed to that, with the very emphatic reservation that
you are to have no authority whatever over <i>her</i>." Denis
laughed as he shrugged his thin shoulders. "Beyond that, Clifton,
go your own lengths. I confess that I am beaten. I am now shifting
the entire burden of the field management of the organization onto
your shoulders, and not only the fate of the Laurentian Company but
also that of Antoinette St. Ives and her brother rest almost
entirely in your hands. It is a big job. But there is one glorious
thing in it&mdash;and that is Antoinette. You won't lack for
inspiration."</p>

<p>"No," said Clifton, "I won't."</p>

<p>Until half-past twelve they buried themselves in business
details; then they had a quick luncheon. It was a quarter of two
when they reached the launch that was to take them out to the
hydroplane. Jeannot was waiting for them. He was a slim, keen-eyed
Frenchman with a wisp of a mustache, and he greeted Clifton with a
friendliness that at once made him a comrade.</p>

<p>At the last moment Clifton caught himself. "Is there a telegraph
office near?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Up there, two blocks," directed Jeannot. "I just sent some
wires to Roberval. Take your time."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Clifton read over the message he was sending
to Antoinette St. Ives, addressed to her aboard the train bound for
Metabetchewan. It would reach her about half past three
o'clock.</p>

<p>The message ran, "Have seen an alienist. He says I am mentally
all right but need very tender attention and care. Love.
Clifton."</p>

<p>A little later Colonel Denis stood alone and watched the
government hydroplane as it rose like a bird from the water,
righted itself, and disappeared swiftly in the direction of the
northern wilderness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p>"This will be an unusual experience for me," Clifton had said to
Jeannot as he adjusted his helmet and speaking-tube receivers
before the Frenchman started his engine. "I have been up overseas
but never have looked down on my own forests. We were not using
flying-machines in the wilderness country back in
nineteen-fourteen. Only lunatics and idiots were beginning to think
of that."</p>

<p>"Some people call us idiots now," laughed Jeannot. "We smash
machines, of course, and some of us count in on the wrecks, because
if anything happens we have just one chance&mdash;and that is to
hit for a lake or a river if it is big enough. And if one isn't
near, or we mess up in our judgment in aiming at it&mdash;something
happens. That is why we use hydroplanes. Water is our only hope.
But for all that we are mapping and photographing new countries,
putting out fires and bringing the farthest frontiers right up to
our doors now."</p>

<p>Looking down on the city a few minutes later Clifton held his
breath in wonderment, and in a flash his mind leaped to the
slow-moving train that was bearing Antoinette St. Ives through the
forests, and to the sacrifice he would willingly make if she could
be gazing down upon this same earthly paradise with him. Jeannot
was saying something through the transmitter but he paid little
heed to the Frenchman's voice or words. Even the roar of the engine
was lost in the thrill that swept his senses.</p>

<p>He had flown over Belgium and Alsace and a part of France; he
had looked down into the streets of Paris and London, and had twice
been over Hongkong and once with an English flier over
Bombay&mdash;but nothing had ever pressed upon him so
overwhelmingly the wonder-working forces of nature and God as this
city of Quebec and the magnificent terrain about it. His mind sped
with the swiftness of his vision, and it seemed to him that Cartier
and Champlain and Roberval and the others must have possessed some
power whereby they too had looked down on this wonderland before
choosing it as the heart of the New World.</p>

<p>In other places Clifton had regarded with interest and curiosity
the works of man, but here man's efforts were completely overridden
and subdued by a colossal triumph of nature. He saw the
Ch&acirc;teau Frontenac like a mighty castle at the edge of an
abyss, the great churches in their squares, and the ancient
fortifications and gleaming monuments and the gray walls of convent
and monastery. The Plains of Abraham and the battlefield of Sainte
Foy circled under him, and he saw the Tidal Basin and Victoria
Park, and where Wolfe and his men crept up in the night, and the
Samos Battery and Spencer Wood. But in a moment these details were
obliterated and forgotten in a vast and awesome panorama that was
spreading itself out under his eyes.</p>

<p>East and west lay the mighty Saint Lawrence, and reaching out
like a protecting arm to hold Quebec in the cradle which it made
was the Saint Charles. In all directions were the blue and silvery
gleams of water. The Isle of Orleans stood out in its frame of
almost royal purple and north of it the splendid River Montmorency
lost itself in forests that were like great dark carpets spread
upon the earth. He could see twenty rivers and lakes, and between
them ancient towns and villages appeared from hidden valleys or
screens of forest and disappeared again like living things. As
Jeannot rose higher the earth widened beneath them until the rising
Laurentians and the forests in the north shut out distance in a
blue haze.</p>

<p>Not until these things had pressed upon him for a number of
minutes did Clifton's mind and vision return to details. He saw the
great castle of Frontenac again and it was like a child's toy.
Quebec was dissolving swiftly into a gray and white tapestry of
sunshine and shadow. Levis and Charlesbourg and Sainte Foy were
gone. A cross gleamed at Indian-Lorette and disappeared in a golden
flash, and the Saint Lawrence was growing narrower while the
Montmorency and the Jacques Carder grew longer.</p>

<p>"A fine atmosphere," called back Jeannot. "You can see a half of
the Seigneurie de la Cote and thirty miles or more into the
Laurentides. We are heading for the country of Fief Hubert now and
Lac Baliscan. With this wind and air we'll make Metabetchewan two
hours ahead of the train you want to beat."</p>

<p>Clifton hunched himself close to the bell-shaped mouth of the
transmitter.</p>

<p>"Will we see the train?" he asked.</p>

<p>"After Lac Baliscan I follow the line of rail," replied Jeanne.
"We should pass your friends about four o'clock."</p>

<p>A thrill of exultation swept over Clifton.</p>

<p>"If you can make them see us," he exclaimed, "I'll buy you a new
hat when I come to Roberval!"</p>

<p>Jeannot saw Clifton's face and eyes for a moment, and grinned.
Denis had told him enough to rouse both his curiosity and his
imagination and he was quick to seize upon the possibilities of the
adventure.</p>

<p>"We'll have them all poking their heads out of the windows," he
promised.</p>

<p>Clifton looked at his watch. It was half past two o'clock. At
three they were over the splendid water-way country that began with
the deep and unbroken wilderness of Fief Hubert. With Lac Croche
and Lac Sainte Anne as the central point Clifton counted forty
lakes within a radius of thirty miles, with Lac Baliscan reaching
north and west like a huge emerald set between rugged walls and
mountains of evergreen forest. Another half-hour and Jeannot
hovered over a break in the wilderness that was like a long and
attenuated thread. It was the railroad, and the Frenchman descended
until the steel rails gleamed clearly in the sunlight.</p>

<p>In a little while they passed over a moving freight-train, that
looked like a string of toy cars standing motionless; and after
that, as Jeannot pointed out things of interest and told how
Quebec's vast forests were going swiftly to destruction Clifton
listened but kept his eyes on the line of rail ahead.</p>

<p>"It isn't what the timber people are <i>cutting</i>," Jeannot
was saying bitterly, with a gesture that took in a thousand square
miles of country. "That could go on forever with proper harvesting
in place of slaughter and with real conservation instead of
political control. Politicians don't know how to deal with
bud-worms and bark beetles and fungi, and just as long as they are
allowed to fill the positions in our forestry service with personal
favorites we shall continue to see what we are seeing now. Look off
there! That's what hydro-planes and sky-photography are bringing
before the people! That dark patch is ten miles square&mdash;burned
over last year. And we'll soon be over ten million dollars' worth
of rotting spruce and jackpine&mdash;killed by the bud-worm and
fungi.</p>

<p>"Those are the problems we are up against, and at the present
time they are not being solved by technical science. You will see
that destruction all over Old and New Quebec, and the government is
just beginning to wake up. If it were not for the intelligence and
technical ability behind some of the big timber-leasing companies
I'd see no hope at all. But as it is I am one of those who believe
that incompetency and graft and sheer political rottenness are
about due for the undertaker."</p>

<p>"So am I," almost shouted Clifton. "That is why I am going
north&mdash;to help out! Do you know Ivan Hurd?"</p>

<p>Jeannot answered with an eloquent shrug of his shoulders.
"Yes&mdash;and his gang," he said. "If we could guillotine about a
dozen of his kind we'd have an honest parliament left. Isn't it one
of the amazing spectacles of the age how a few clever scoundrels
can gag and hoodwink ten times their number of men who at heart
really have the desire to be honest and constructive instead of
otherwise? It is simply the old story of the leader and the sheep.
One clever leader is worth a hundred followers, and if that leader
happens to be a grafter and a scoundrel&mdash;God help the
people!"</p>

<p>"What would happen," asked Clifton, "if something should occur
to destroy the power and political influence of Ivan Hurd? I have
been away a long time and the situation here is quite new to
me."</p>

<p>"It would mark the beginning of the break-up," said Jeannot,
idling his engine for a moment. "And after that, within five years,
we would be well on our way in the care of our forests, as a man
cares for his orchards or a farmer for his fields. We would have
real forestry men in our service, a technically fitted
fire-control, the right kind of legislation and half-way decent
funds for the biggest work that man has before him on earth today.
We would get hold of the spruce bud-worm and the bark beetle and
the borer and have specialists working out the problem of fungi
destruction. Forest protection and propagation and harvesting would
in time become a science as exact as that of chemistry and
medicine.</p>

<p>"But before we can get at men like Hurd and his gang people must
be made to realize that their lives are absolutely dependent upon
wild life and forests. Without these things we would become extinct
as a race. Without wood we would have no agriculture, no
manufacture and no commerce, and civilization as we know it would
come to an end. Those are the truths we must bring to the people,
and when that time comes there will be a wholesale resignation of
political incompetents and their replacement by men who are
technically and professionally fitted to do what must be done if we
escape ultimate ruin."</p>

<p>Jeannot had lost the line of rail in the heat of his enthusiasm.
He swung back to it again and as the thin threads of steel gleamed
under them he pointed suddenly ahead.</p>

<p>"Smoke!" he exclaimed. "Maybe you can't see it. Quite a trick to
make out smoke from a hydroplane. But that's the train&mdash;ten
miles ahead of us!"</p>

<p>Sight of smoke which Clifton could not yet see in the sky had
changed the Frenchman. There was an eager attentiveness in the
forward thrust of his head and mischievous lines had gathered at
the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>"I hope you won't get groggy if I duck about a little," he said.
"It's the surest way of bringing their heads out, and if you want
to get a look at St. Ives, or Mademoiselle Antoinette&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do," said Clifton. He had no reason for keeping that fact
from his companion. He rather liked the idea of being a little
confidential with this newly discovered friend. "I'm trying my best
to marry Mademoiselle St. Ives," he added.</p>

<p>"<i>Par Dieu</i>, I wish you luck!" exclaimed Jeannot. "Will she
guess you are in the machine?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>To himself Clifton was laughing, and accompanying his humor was
a thrill which was beginning to send little electrical flashes
through his body. What would Antoinette St. Ives say and think if
she knew he was in the machine which would soon be cutting capers
about the train in which she was slowly plodding along? And what
would be her reaction when he advanced in all the profound triumph
of his achievement to greet her as she stepped off the train at the
little Metabetchewan depot? He could fancy the amazement and shock
of that unexpected moment. And now if Jeannot only knew enough of
the jugglery of flying to write his initials or the letters of his
name in the air his cup of happiness would be filled to
overflowing. He had known of such things being done overseas.
Dare-deviltry, of course, but he was willing to risk that, and
intimated as much to the Frenchman.</p>

<p>Jeannot shrugged his shoulders and kept his opinion to himself.
In a few minutes they saw the train. It seemed to be traveling at a
ridiculously slow speed and Jeannot sailed over it a thousand feet
high. On their right and ahead of them, running parallel with the
line of rail for a number of miles was Kiskisink Lake, and after
certain observations Jeannot made a wide circle and returned to the
train scarcely more than half as high as before. The hydroplane was
already observed. The engineer greeted it with shrill whistles and
faces and heads began to appear at the open windows of the coaches.
Clifton waved his hand, and then a white handkerchief. He shouted,
forgetting for a moment that the roar of the engine would drown his
voice. He felt like a small boy who wanted to jump up and down and
wave his arms and yell. And then came a wild and delirious eternity
of semi-oblivion.</p>

<p>With a shout of warning Jeannot swung high up over the open
lake. What happened after that Clifton's mind was incapable of
comprehending. Above all other things he was an earth-man, and from
such a being he was suddenly shot into a nightmare existence of
dives and twistings and somersaultings that stopped his heart and
his breath and his power of vision, and which seemed to mix all his
senses and the vital organs of his body into one anesthetized mess.
His only intelligent thought was that Jeannot had gone mad and they
were falling a million miles, turning over three or four times a
second in that endless descent.</p>

<p>He could see trains, plenty of them. Now they were over him, and
then under him, sometimes running away and at others coming head-on
but never traveling in a reasonable kind of way. How long it was
before there came a subdued shock, a rushing hiss of water and
after than an easy and undulating motion Clifton would not have
dared to guess. It might have been one
minute&mdash;five&mdash;fifteen&mdash;or a week. Anyway, this fool
of a Jeannot had not destroyed them and the hydroplane was sweeping
along easily on the water.</p>

<p>And then came Jeannot's voice, "Take a look, Captain Brant!
There isn't a head inside the windows, and if that is not Gaspard
St. Ives in the third car&mdash;and his sister looking with
him&mdash;I'll forfeit the hat you are going to get me at
Roberval!"</p>

<p>Clifton's muddled wits were slow in assembling themselves and
before he could make out the third car from the fifth or sixth a
headland of forest drove the hydro-plane out into the lake, and two
or three minutes later they were again in the air, with a thin
trail of smoke swiftly disappearing behind them.</p>

<p>The Frenchman was debonair and smiling.</p>

<p>"Did you see them, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>Clifton indulged in a sickly grin.</p>

<p>"I must have. I saw everything from the beginning of the world
up to the present time. Where did you learn that stuff?"</p>

<p>"Picked it up over there. Mostly along the Somme and at Verdun
and the Ypres salient."</p>

<p>Clifton reached a hand over to Jeannot. Their grip was a long
and understanding one. "I didn't know that," he said. "Colonel
Denis said nothing about it. We were three times engaged at Ypres,
and were at Courcelette and Vimy Ridge. Maybe I saw you there. The
air fighting was superb."</p>

<p>"It was most interesting," agreed Jeannot.</p>

<p>At Saint Andr&eacute; Junction he left the line of rail and
swung a point or two eastward. Half an hour later the hydroplane
lay on the smooth surface of Lake Saint John a hundred yards from
the Metabetchewan shore and a skiff was rowing out to them.</p>

<p>"We have a government wire as far up as the junction of the
Mistassini and Rivi&egrave;re aux Rats," said Jeannot when they
parted. "If you ever want to get hold of me call Roberval.
Accident, you know, or something like that. I can reach you in an
hour. And, by the way, never mind the hat!"</p>

<p>His engine was roaring and he was off with a smile and a wave of
his hand as Clifton shouted good-by from the boat. When he stepped
ashore Jeannot was a speck in the western sky.</p>

<p>Shouldering his pack Clifton walked up past the little old
sawmill with its tall black smoke-stack, crossed the railroad and
wandered up and down the two or three Metabetchewan streets which
he remembered so well. Then he stopped at Price Brothers'
outfitting depot and from the agent in charge learned that a few
men were already beginning to leave for the big woods.
Campbuilders, mostly, the man told him. His name was Tremblay, and
Clifton wondered if the Tremblays were as thick as ever in the
north country, and if the Gagnons had come up to them in their race
for numerical supremacy.</p>

<p>He asked about the new baby, and found that Philip Tremblay was
the father of twins born three months before, making a total of
fourteen children to date, and all doing nicely. In time Philip
hoped to have a family of which he could be proud, he said, and
especially as he had promised the local priest to adopt two
children from the family of the first man who was killed in the
woods that year, which act would surely bring him good luck and
reward. Clifton liked his optimism and sense of humor, and when
Madame Tremblay dropped in for a few moments to see her husband he
was delighted with her freshness and good looks and general
appearance of happiness. Fourteen children had not taken the
sparkle from her dark eyes or the quick blush from her cheeks.</p>

<p>The Tremblays invited him to a supper which he could finish
before train time, and he accepted. The fourteen children were as
clean as Madame Tremblay's scrubbed floors, and Philip's eyes
danced with pride when he told of a reunion recently held by his
father at which only Tremblays over sixty years of age could be
crowded at the tables in the house, while all other Tremblays under
that age had to be served in a field. It required four
two-hundred-pound hogs to feed them, and all the people were quite
closely related, second cousins being the most distant in
kinship.</p>

<p>He was full of enthusiasm for his work, and expressed himself as
not satisfied with the way things were going this year, although it
was pretty early to judge conditions accurately. The jobbers were
sticking to their old companies, and there seemed to be plenty of
them, but there was restlessness and dissatisfaction among the men
which he did not like. The head choppers, swampers and teamsters
were not so easy to get, while the ordinary roustabouts or second
choppers were hardest of all to enlist in sufficient numbers. He
was afraid that jobbers who had contracted to cut from twenty to
thirty thousand logs each for the company would find difficulty in
getting out a half or two-thirds of that number.</p>

<p>One reason for the scarcity of men, he said, was that the big
Hurd-Foy interests were opening up new districts north, and were
promising men bonuses and better wages, and were generally
upsetting conditions as they had previously existed. The Laurentian
Company was especially hard hit, he had heard, because its men came
mostly from the west and north shores of Lake Saint John between
Saint Prime and Peribonka, while the Price Company had the
advantage of drawing its working forces from the towns and villages
south and east of Metabetchewan.</p>

<p>"We cut a hundred and fifteen million feet board measure last
year," he declared with pride, "and Price Brothers are building
another paper mill on the Little Discharge over at Alma in
anticipation of beating that cut by a half. We've got to
hustle&mdash;and we're going to!"</p>

<p>That was the spirit with which Clifton went to the depot. It was
in the air and in his blood. Such a country as this, with all its
glorious sunshine and freedom and cleanness would not permit a
beast like Ivan Hurd to dominate it. He gazed out over Lake Saint
John in the sunset. Twenty miles across the water the four mighty
rivers of the north were emptying into it, the Little and the Big
Peribonka, the Mistassini and the Ashuapmouchan. He fancied he
could almost hear the roar of them as they came tumbling out of the
wilderness, clean and strong and filled from shore to shore with
the virility of the vast forests which man had just begun to
enter.</p>

<p>He had known Louis H&eacute;mon, with his sensitive, finely
strung soul and not overstrong body, and wondered if good old
Samuel Bedard and his wife Maria, whom H&eacute;mon had put in his
novel, still lived in the little village of Peribonka. Quite
vividly he recalled a raw evening of autumn rain when Maria
Chapdelaine had fried eggs and made coffee for him, and afterward
how he had sat with Samuel in his little store and exchanged
stories between pipes. He was sure the men of Maria Chapdelaine's
country would be with them in their fight with Hurd.</p>

<p>He was thirty minutes ahead of time at the depot, and puffing at
his pipe as he walked up and down the plank platform he began an
analysis of certain thoughts and plans which his hydroplane
experience had not permitted him to attempt until now. But as each
minute passed his ability to reason grew less, until at last he
concentrated himself entirely upon the movement of the hands of his
watch. Never had he felt a sensation quite so pleasurably thrilling
as that which these minutes brought to him. In a quarter of an hour
he would see Antoinette St. Ives&mdash;if the train was not late.
The agent told him it was on time, and that in itself set his blood
running faster.</p>

<p>He was boyishly jubilant as he walked the last few minutes away.
Antoinette would be glad to see him, he was quite sure, in spite of
the acidity of her letter. He read the letter again as he listened
for the engine whistle and endeavored to find something between the
lines which would mellow its insinuation. He tried to picture
Antoinette's lovely eyes filled with laughter and her lips smiling
as she wrote it, and his hopefulness made him fairly
successful.</p>

<p>Then he heard the whistle. A small crowd of people had gathered
and he drew himself well back among these, and asked two or three
foolish questions of a whiskered man who stood at the end of a
buckboard which he had backed up against the platform. Just about
where would the third coach stop, and from which end of it would
the passengers alight? The whiskered man regarded him mildly and
answered him as if he might have been a child. "It stops most
anywhere and they get off at both ends," he said, and then added
gratuitously, "The engine comes in first, Monsieur!"</p>

<p>He was near the third coach when the train stopped. His heart
thumped as passengers began to descend the steps nearest
him&mdash;a fat woman first with three children clinging to her
hands and skirts, an old man with a basket of eggs, a trio of
woodsmen with packs and cowhide boots, and then a dog tugging at
the end of a leash as it crowded its lank and bony head between the
humans. It was Bim! Clifton almost cried out as the old hound made
the platform, with Joe holding manfully to the other end of the
strap. Following them came the beginning of an enormous bundle, and
after the bundle Gaspard St. Ives himself, puffing and growling
because of the size of it, and close behind him was Friar Alphonse,
empty-handed but giving advice freely.</p>

<p>Clifton held his breath as he waited for Antoinette, who came
immediately after her big brother and the little monk had cleared a
way for her. For a moment she stood poised on the last step of the
coach, a slim and boyish little goddess in gray knickers, with a
Scotch tam on her head bearing a single feather at a saucy angle.
Clifton felt the desire to cry out again. He wanted to run up to
her and help her down before Friar Alphonse could perform that
duty, but his legs failed to move.</p>

<p>He was stunned to inaction by her appearance now, so different
from the lacy softness of her loveliness in the Ch&acirc;teau St.
Ives, before which his optimism and man-egoism had failed to
crumble. But here, in every exquisite inch of her, was something
not only to worship but to be afraid of. From the tips of her
trimly booted little feet to the curls that glowed under her tam
she was vibrantly athrill with some new force which was manifesting
itself to him for the first time. He had never dreamed that a pair
of knickers and a jaunty tam-o'-shanter and a single feather that
seemed to fling defiance into the teeth of the world could produce
such a crushing effect.</p>

<p>He made a step forward, trying to recall the action and words
which he had planned for this moment. Events began to shape
themselves instantly. The monk had given his hand to Antoinette,
and it was Gaspard who saw him first, staring with unbelieving eyes
over the top of his bundle. In the same moment, Bim gave a muffled
howl of recognition and leaped upon him with such force that his
hat was sent to the ground and he reeled against the old man with
the basket of eggs. Joe was only a step behind the dog, and by the
time he had recovered from their greeting St. Ives had dropped his
bundle and was shaking his hands, his huge bulk shutting out
entirely the soldierly little figure in knickers and tam.</p>

<p>And to further wreck the joy of this hour upon which he had
built so much Mademoiselle St. Ives herself took his hat from Joe,
dusted it with her handkerchief, and gave it to him without a
tremor of thrill or surprise in her voice as she said:</p>

<p>"A little gasoline will take this oil spot from your hat,
Monsieur. It is too bad!"</p>

<p>And without further word of greeting she turned to the whiskered
man whom Clifton had questioned and followed him to the waiting
buckboard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p>"This is marvelous!" St. Ives was crying. "So you were in that
machine driven by Lucien Jeannot, who is crazier in the air than a
lovesick loon at courting time! And my sister, the little rascal,
said nothing when we were all guessing our heads off as to who it
was with Jeannot in that fool's play that made our hearts come up
between our teeth. But I might have guessed it from her whiteness
and the way she trembled when it was over. For a little while it
looked as though Jeannot was going to put an end to you, <i>mon
fr&egrave;re</i>!"</p>

<p>"If she was white, and trembled, then it must have been for
Jeannot&mdash;because she did not know I was in the machine," said
Clifton.</p>

<p>The little monk chuckled.</p>

<p>"Our sweet Antoinette is not a dull-head like her brother," he
said, and it seemed to Clifton his face was more than usually thin
and pallid as he looked after the girl and Joe and the dog. "I
think she made a very good guess, Monsieur&mdash;and as for the oil
spot on your hat&mdash;gasoline <i>will</i> take it off!" And with
that cryptic remark he left them, and joined Antoinette as the
whiskered man turned back for Gaspard's dunnage.</p>

<p>Clifton walked along at the side of St. Ives. He had no plans
now. His confidence was limp and unsettled. He had expected that
his race to Metabetchewan, with all that it implied, would make a
different impression on the girl who had inspired it. He had sensed
the dramatic about it, almost the sensational, but more than all
else he had intended it to prove his devotion and his sincerity,
his determination to fight her fight with the same irrepressible
energy with which he was making his own. That for some reason he
had failed made him momentarily miserable. He began to see
something of the opera bouffe in his action. Its anticlimax had
been crushingly decisive. An oil spot on his hat! For a few moments
he felt like choking Gaspard, and the monk, and especially Bim.</p>

<p>Antoinette had climbed into the one seat of the buckboard, and
Joe was beside her. They were laughing over Bim, who had dragged
his gaunt body up after them.</p>

<p>Then the whiskered man was at Gaspard's bundle. He seemed to be
all whiskers, Clifton thought, now that he observed him more
closely. For the owner of the buckboard was grinning at him
openly&mdash;almost violently&mdash;as if he understood quite
clearly why it was he had asked such silly questions before the
train arrived. And Mademoiselle Antoinette was saying something to
Friar Alphonse, smiling down at him. She turned and looked in his
direction. Her pretty teeth flashed and the audacious feather
bobbed. When Gaspard drew him up to the buckboard, with a friendly
grip on his arm, she looked at him coldly.</p>

<p>Then as if a sudden thought had come to her she said to her
brother: "Please take Joe and Bim with you, Gaspard. I will drive
on alone with Captain Brant. I have something of importance to say
to him."</p>

<p>Clifton's heart jumped. He lifted Joe down, asking him about the
old gun. "Wish I had the old stuffed owl now&mdash;the one that
never failed to bring good luck, Joe," he said, loud enough for
Antoinette to hear. "I'm going to need it!"</p>

<p>As the girl's cool gray eyes looked down at him Clifton heard
Gaspard making explanations.</p>

<p>"My sister loathes inns and closed rooms when we are in this
country, Monsieur, so we camp and walk and live in the open air.
Barnabe and our cook have camp made and our supper waiting for us
at the lake shore. Get up&mdash;and <i>bon voyage</i>! You'll need
to trot to beat us there for I am as empty as a drum!"</p>

<p>Clifton climbed into the seat occupied by the girl. She had
drawn to her own side, leaving as much space as possible between
them. Clifton looked at it, and then at her.</p>

<p>"Just enough room for the owl&mdash;if I had it," he said
gloomily.</p>

<p>Barnabe the whiskered man was putting the last of the dunnage in
the wagon. St. Ives surveyed it for a moment.</p>

<p>"Where is your pack?" he asked Clifton.</p>

<p>"At Price Brothers'."</p>

<p>"Then you can stop for it as you pass."</p>

<p>"Captain Brant will not need his pack, brother," said
Mademoiselle St. Ives sweetly, yet with a little note of finality
in her voice that was blasting. "I shall keep him only a few
minutes."</p>

<p>She chirruped to the big black horse between the thills and they
moved away. Clifton stole a glance at her, but the droop of her tam
was on his side and hid her eyes from him.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry!" he thought aloud.</p>

<p>She was sitting very straight and rigid, her small hands
gripping the lines more tightly than necessary.</p>

<p>"Sorry&mdash;for what?" she sniffed. "That you aren't more of a
gentleman?"</p>

<p>"No. I am sorry I did not get on the other side of you, where
your tam doesn't droop, so that I could look at your hair. From
this side I can see only your chin and the tip of your nose, and
both look so ferocious that I am a little frightened. May I
change?"</p>

<p>"If you wish."</p>

<p>The unexpectedness of her acquiescence as she stopped the horse
and waited for him to alight made him feel foolish. In spite of a
mighty effort to keep his blood back he knew his face was red when
he climbed up on the opposite side of her. Her own coolness and the
pitying smile on her lips made him more uncomfortable. She was
bewitchingly lovely. Her hair was radiant in the fading sunlight.
Her lips were rose-red. But in her eyes, soft as damask at times,
were icy coldness and a smiling contempt.</p>

<p>She chirruped the horse into a trot. They passed Price
Brothers', went up the hill and were in the glorious country of the
habitant, with all of Lake Saint John shimmering softly in the last
glow of the August sunset. Here, in this paradise which lay within
a cup of the Laurentians, the hills and meadows were still
verdantly green at the end of summer. It might have been
springtime. The air was fresh and sweet. Flowers were blooming.
Birds were singing. The sky was made of turquoise. And ahead of
them ran the road, two hundred years old, dustless and
winding&mdash;a road made first by Indians and then by cattle's
feet, a thing of enchantment and of lure running into and through a
country of peace, contentment and faith and ending only where the
wilderness held it back in the north.</p>

<p>Clifton, stealing another glance sideways, saw the color in the
girl's cheeks and an eager glow in her eyes.</p>

<p>"It is beautiful," he volunteered feebly. "And&mdash;this is a
very ancient road."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said. "I know it."</p>

<p>She managed to edge another half-inch away from him.</p>

<p>"If you please, Captain Brant, we will forget the scenery and
take up another matter. Of course you think you are a very clever
man. People who make exhibitions of themselves, as you love to do,
are invariably possessed of that ego. You have made yourself
ridiculous and&mdash;unbearable. You might amuse me if it were not
for the fact that you have elected to practice your eccentricities
on me. I believe I am charitable when I speak of your queerness as
eccentricity. Others might call it a mania which would bear
watching. But I know you went through the war, and it is possible
something might have affected your mind during those horrible
years. Shell-shock, for instance, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>She hesitated, seeking a word.</p>

<p>"Go on," pleaded Clifton. "The Germans never did anything like
this to me. In a minute or two more it will kill. And all because I
am mad enough to love the very dust you pick up on the soles of
your feet!"</p>

<p>"<i>Love!</i>" She turned a look of withering scorn on him.
"Could such a thing be accompanied by all the insult you have
heaped on me?"</p>

<p>"Look out!" he admonished sharply. "You're driving into the
ditch!"</p>

<p>She straightened herself with a sudden pull on one of the reins.
"Could it?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Could it what?" he asked stupidly. "You're making me
nervous&mdash;the way you drive! If you wouldn't mind letting me
take the lines&mdash;"</p>

<p>She passed them into his hand with a furious little gesture. She
was beautifully angry. He could see that with half an eye. "I would
cut off a hand&mdash;yes, I would kill myself before I would
knowingly insult you," he said. "How have I done it?"</p>

<p>"How?" There was a note of amazement&mdash;of despair&mdash;in
her voice. "Captain Brant, you are utterly hardened to all the
conventions of decency, of ordinary courtesy, of&mdash;oh, I don't
know the word that could tell it all!"</p>

<p>"It isn't born yet," he helped, regaining a little of his
cheerfulness. "Here is a fork in the trail, Mademoiselle. Which do
we take?"</p>

<p>"The right, of course. Isn't that the lake side?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;am so upset," he excused himself. "Nothing I
do seems to be quite proper, even to choosing between roads. How
have I insulted you? If you can prove it to me I will go out there
and drown myself in your sight. I have promised to die for you
anyway, if you ask it."</p>

<p>"You are insulting me even now!"</p>

<p>"God forgive me if I am. I don't intend to be."</p>

<p>She faced him as squarely as she could in the seat. Her cheeks
were blazing. Her eyes were gloriously afire. "You began
it&mdash;that first night&mdash;in my own home. I forgave you. I
even allowed you to repeat the insult later, after your talk with
Hurd, when you left me. I tried to think you were moved by an
impulse of which you would be ashamed afterward, and that you would
redeem yourself."</p>

<p>"I am not ashamed that I love you," said Clifton gently. "It is
the first great glory that has come into my life."</p>

<p>"And that same night," she continued, her face flushing still
more hotly, "you had the impertinence and audacity to tell Ivan
Hurd that you were going to marry me!"</p>

<p>"If God is with me, I am," affirmed Clifton desperately. "That
is not an insult, Antoinette. It is a statement of fact that has
grown to be bigger than life in my heart. If I fail&mdash;if I
don't marry you&mdash;I don't care to go on living!"</p>

<p>"Oh, if Gaspard was only here," almost sobbed the girl, facing
the road again. "You call me Antoinette&mdash;and repeat the insult
here&mdash;to my face! Oh, oh, oh! And then you called me <i>cara
sposa</i>, which isn't Hindu at all, but Italian&mdash;and which
doesn't mean what you said it did, but which&mdash;which
means&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lover, sweetheart, wife&mdash;everything that is dear and
precious in the love of a human soul," finished Clifton, as words
refused to come from her lips. "I ask your forgiveness
there&mdash;and yet I meant it all!"</p>

<p>"And then the wire&mdash;the telegram that came to me on the
train&mdash;and after that the hydroplane&mdash;and
now&mdash;<i>this</i>! It is either madness or&mdash;I don't know
what. You are old enough to know better. You are almost old enough
to be my&mdash;my&mdash;father."</p>

<p>That was the deadly shot that hit. She had reached for the
reins, and he surrendered them limply. His head drooped. And in
that same moment the sweet soul of Antoinette St. Ives cried out
against the crime she had committed. She looked up quickly into his
hurt face. Her voice broke, and all the bitterness that had been in
it was gone.</p>

<p>"Oh, I pray God you will forgive me for that," she cried. "It
was wicked&mdash;untrue&mdash;ungrateful&mdash;and I didn't mean
it. But maybe it was necessary for me to hurt you&mdash;to make you
understand. You have said such shocking things to
me&mdash;so&mdash;suddenly. And now you must go back. Please."</p>

<p>She stopped the horse.</p>

<p>Slowly, as if afflicted by that very hand of age with which she
had taunted him, he climbed from the buckboard. Then he looked up
at her. His face had grown older in those moments. His eyes seemed
tired.</p>

<p>"I do love you, Antoinette," he said, and his voice was almost
whispering in its worship. "And I am Crepin Marrolet come back to
find you and fight for you after two hundred and fifty years.
But"&mdash;and the old whimsical smile played for an instant over
his face&mdash;"I <i>am</i> older than Crepin, I guess. Somewhere
there has been a mistake in the passing of the centuries."</p>

<p>She struck the big black horse with the loose ends of the reins.
"You are younger than Crepin ever was," she cried down to him, and
there was a softness in her eyes which left his heart beating
strangely as she disappeared down the road, a straight little
figure that never once looked back as he watched her.</p>

<p>He walked back slowly. The sun had gone down and blue shadows
were creeping softly over the lake. Yet a last glow had settled at
the tip of a white cross on a distant hill, like a radiant bird
resting for an instant in its flight. That cross seemed to rise
like a comforting benediction as the world faded drowsily into the
mellow shades of twilight. It was like a voice to Clifton, and its
whisper seemed to be, "Men are seeking me, reaching out for me,
crying for me&mdash;yet they do not find me. They are looking far,
and I am very near&mdash;so far that they look over and beyond me
when I am waiting at their feet. When at last they see me, and
understand, then will they have discovered the greatest of all
treasures&mdash;Faith and Contentment!"</p>

<p>It comforted him, and he felt joy creeping into his heart, and
he fancied Antoinette at the foot of the cross with her sweet face
bowed in prayer. Schisms and sects and religions might rend and
rave in the outside world, tear at each other's throats and seek
destruction&mdash;but here in this ancient land of horse and buggy
and simple creed, of priest and cross and unbounded faith was the
dream still true of peace on earth and good will toward
men&mdash;except when the outside world sent in its poisons and its
dissensions to break down and jeer at a childlike belief in God and
the preachers of God which two centuries of simple living had built
up.</p>

<p>He was not a Catholic, yet because of the cross and these
thoughts his confidence pressed upon him stronger than ever, and he
knew that a just people and an honest people&mdash;and the priests
in their little churches&mdash;would be behind them in their
struggle with Hurd if they could be made to understand.</p>

<p>As the tip of the cross dissolved into the soft gray of the sky
he heard boisterous voices in song, and in a few moments came upon
St. Ives and the whiskered man singing, while the monk and Joe and
Bim trailed a little behind. For a moment depression fell upon him.
He was no longer one of these. Antoinette had made him understand
quite clearly that she did not desire his company. Then at sight of
Joe and Bim the little god of hope and resolution bobbed up in him
again. She could not steal them and leave him out!</p>

<p>St. Ives was carrying a pack.</p>

<p>"It's yours," he said, and stopped at the roadside until the
others were well ahead. When they were out of hearing he
questioned, "She sent you back, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"What is left of me," nodded Clifton.</p>

<p>St. Ives laughed and bared his blond head to the coolness of the
evening. "<i>Mon Dieu</i>, but she is a little tyrant when the
spirit takes her," he gloated, "and I love her for it! I brought
your pack because I knew that after she had said it all she would
be sorry. What is the trouble, friend?"</p>

<p>Clifton looked St. Ives squarely in the eyes.</p>

<p>"I think I should tell you," he said. "You are her brother
and&mdash;father. I love your sister. She knows it, and resents it.
I love her more than any woman was ever loved from the beginning of
time. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>A scowl gathered in Gaspard's face.</p>

<p>"That is false, Monsieur," he rumbled. "It is a monstrous lie.
No other woman was ever loved as I love Angelique Fanchon! And if
you repeat it again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you know how I feel, Gaspard. Without her I don't want to
live&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Pouf!</i>" snorted St. Ives. "Is that all, Monsieur? Well,
without Angelique I <i>won't</i> live! That is the difference
between us. You simply don't want to live and I am determined not
to live. Is that proof, or shall we settle it in another way here
where the grass is soft and green, and your falls will be less
violent?"</p>

<p>Clifton stared at the other in amazement.</p>

<p>"Are you mad, as Friar Alphonse has so often declared?" he
gasped. "Did you not hear me? I love your sister! I have told her,
and because I dared do that she is in a rage at me. Are you not
surprised, shocked, angry at me yourself? Break my neck if you want
to! I promise not to lift a hand in resistance&mdash;"</p>

<p>The incomprehensible St. Ives chuckled and rubbed his great
hands as if he perceived a huge joke.</p>

<p>"You have told me nothing," he said. "Of course you love my
sister. You would be blind and deaf and a fool if you did not. And
it has been no secret with me&mdash;since early candlelight this
morning. My sister left your letter on her bed, and in the
excitement of getting away so unexpectedly I read a little of it to
see what was being so carelessly left about&mdash;and having read a
little of it I read more, and then the Devil himself could not have
stopped me from finishing it. But she does not know it, Monsieur,
and by Saints Peter and Paul I would give five years of my life to
be able to write a letter like that to my Angelique!"</p>

<p>"And the fact that I wrote it does not outrage you?"</p>

<p>"<i>Maudit</i>, no! My respect for you has grown. To write such
a letter is a virtue and not a crime. Besides, I have never known a
man I like more than you. Only you must take back what you said
about Angelique Fanchon and apologize to her through me!" And
Gaspard shifted Clifton's pack with a ferocious hunch of his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"I said nothing about her."</p>

<p>"But you implied a great deal&mdash;that she is not beautiful
and good enough to be loved as you think you love my sister!"</p>

<p>"I apologize. And now if you will give me my pack&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will carry it, brother."</p>

<p>"But I am going the other way."</p>

<p>"You are going <i>this</i> way," said Gaspard stoutly, and set
off at a good pace after the monk and Joe and Barnabe the camp
man.</p>

<p>"But she sent me back," insisted Clifton, dropping in at his
side. "She is angry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And she will be angrier if you take her at her word," declared
St. Ives.</p>

<p>They walked a distance in silence.</p>

<p>It was still day, though the hour was close to eight o'clock in
the evening. Shadows were deepening and distances were melting away
but there were bird-chirpings and sleepy twitterings along the
roadside, and out of nowhere had come a silence that was like a
mothering hand caressing the world to rest. To Clifton it seemed a
thing that could be felt and touched. He looked at St. Ives. In his
face, too, the miracle of it was revealed. Lightness of thought and
humor were gone as he looked off into the beauty and stillness of
coming night.</p>

<p>"It is in this country that I want to live&mdash;and die," he
said.</p>

<p>"And I," said Clifton, and drew so near that his elbow touched
St. Ives.</p>

<p>They were thinking of the same thing.</p>

<p>"If it can be brought to pass&mdash;</p>

<p>"It can!" Clifton's hand rested on the other's arm, and he heard
John Denis's voice telling him again what it was that lay at the
bottom of St. Ives's heart&mdash;the demon of vengeance ambushed
and waiting there for its final hour with Hurd. "It can," he
repeated in a low voice, "if you will leave Ivan Hurd to me."</p>

<p>"And if you fail&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I cannot fail."</p>

<p>St. Ives looked straight ahead.</p>

<p>"By which you mean that if all other things fail you will do
what I have determined to do&mdash;ahead of you?"</p>

<p>"It may be our thought is the same. But I have no sister, and no
Angelique Fanchon who loves me."</p>

<p>St. Ives drew a deep breath. "If it were not for them&mdash;for
those two holding me back&mdash;it would have been ended now. God
knows it would be just and honorable for me to kill Hurd!"</p>

<p>"Then it is not all this Ajax Trappier? Angelique Fanchon has
made a vow, as well as your sister&mdash;and they will make
sacrifice together if you destroy Hurd? That is the truth, Gaspard.
Why not speak it?"</p>

<p>"It is," acknowledged St. Ives. "And Ajax Trappier, while he
does not know this truth, is trying to take advantage of me in the
absence which Angelique's vow has made necessary. That is why I am
going to break his bones!"</p>

<p>"Of that I approve," replied Clifton. "But the other&mdash;what
good would be done by killing Hurd?"</p>

<p>"I would rid the earth of a monster&mdash;a beast who wants my
sister, who would buy her, ruin her, destroy her happiness&mdash;do
anything to possess her&mdash;and who has heaped insult upon her
that I should wipe out."</p>

<p>"Yet in doing this you would make another Am&eacute;lie de
Repentigny of your sister?"</p>

<p>"I would have achieved justice."</p>

<p>"As it was reckoned two hundred years ago&mdash;yes. And in
achieving it you would also destroy another whom you
love&mdash;Angelique Fanchon? St. Ives, you are a fool!"</p>

<p>"It may be, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"And you would become an outcast yourself&mdash;to be hanged by
the neck until dead if caught. A pretty mess you would make of it.
Again I say you are a fool!"</p>

<p>"It may be, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"And Angelique will marry Trappier."</p>

<p>"That is her vow, foolishly made. But there will be no Trappier
when I am finished, with him. And&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Hurd is coming up into the woods. He will spend the fall and
winter among his men. I shall kill him when he is alone, and no one
will know. That is my hope."</p>

<p>Clifton gave a sigh of despair.</p>

<p>"You would deliberately murder&mdash;and then lie to your sister
and Angelique. I believe Friar Alphonse now. Your soul is
lost."</p>

<p>"And you, Monsieur? If you take my place, and kill Hurd, will
your soul not be lost, and will you not become an outcast&mdash;and
hang by the neck as gracefully as I?"</p>

<p>"I have no sister, no Angelique&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you have an Antoinette."</p>

<p>St. Ives's voice held something hidden and quietly thrilling, as
if back of it lay a secret.</p>

<p>Yet in the face of it, even as his heart leaped to the thrill,
Clifton tried to laugh.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten. We must be near the camp. If you will give me
my pack&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not heavy, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"But I am going back."</p>

<p>"No, you are going on," said Gaspard with unruffled
stubbornness. "You would be a coward if you turned back.
Besides&mdash;my sister is expecting you."</p>

<p>"Expecting&mdash;the devil!" exclaimed Clifton. "A little more
and I believe she would have horsewhipped me."</p>

<p>"Possibly&mdash;and then have cried her eyes out about it all
night. You are a dunce among women. I know them!"</p>

<p>"Why do you think she&mdash;may&mdash;expect me?" stammered
Clifton dubiously. "I am afraid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Pouf</i>! I know. She read that long letter of yours again
on the train, trying to hide it behind a magazine. And when the
telegram came and I asked to see it she blushed until I thought she
was going to cry. I swear she knew you were in the hydroplane,
too&mdash;and when you were done with those fool stunts in which it
looked as though you were bound to break your necks she was whiter
than chalk. <i>Maudit</i>, it would take a wise man to tell who the
fool is&mdash;you or me&mdash;or both!"</p>

<p>A moment more and they made a turn in the road. Lakeward, partly
hidden by a fringe of trees, was a green little meadow through
which a creek ran, and in it were two tents. Sweet-smelling pine
smoke was rising lazily from a camp-fire, and about this fire a man
was busy among various pans and pots and kettles.</p>

<p>St. Ives sniffed at the air.</p>

<p>"There is duck in the wind&mdash;roast duck with onions," he
said. "In all the county of Lac Saint Jean there is no cook can
roast a duck like Napoleon Plante, or cook a fish or sirloin of
moose so well. And I am pinched with hunger, Monsieur!"</p>

<p>Clifton held back. He could see the big black horse grazing
beyond the tents and the buckboard wagon near them. From the creek,
whose cooling splash among pebbles and rocks he could clearly
hear.</p>

<p>Barnabe came with a pail of water. The cook was whistling. But
there was no sign or sound of Antoinette, or of Joe and Bim.</p>

<p>"Even now I think I shall turn back, if you will give me my
pack," he said.</p>

<p>A dog's howl came up from the shadowy edge of the lake.</p>

<p>"She is down there," said St. Ives, and raised his voice in a
sudden mighty shout that carried half a mile. In a moment it was
answered by a girl's halloo, and Joe and Bim raced up through the
dusky twilight of the slope.</p>

<p>St. Ives had seized Clifton's arm and there was no escaping the
hold.</p>

<p>"You should be happy, <i>ami</i>. Come!"</p>

<p>As they advanced Clifton saw a slim figure approaching from the
shore. Joe and Bim were on him in another moment, and he seized the
hand of one and patted the bony head of the other, but his eyes
were on the figure coming up the slope, and a quaking was in his
heart.</p>

<p>She was bareheaded. She had loosened her curls and the cool
breeze was playing with them as they clustered about her neck and
shoulders. She made no effort to fasten them back as the distance
between them grew thrillingly shorter. She was like a glorious,
beautiful child, Clifton thought, and it amazed him that the glad
smile did not leave her lips or the soft light fade from her eyes
when she saw he was with her brother. He stood silent and a little
grim, still holding Joe's hand. He was having difficulty in keeping
his heart working steadily, and his effort gave to his face a look
of sternness and to his posture a rigid and almost soldier-like
stiffness. She greeted Gaspard and then turned to him.</p>

<p>"You have come so slowly, and I am starving," she protested.
"Joe and Bim and Barnabe arrived a quarter of an hour ago, and
Alphonse came ahead of them. I can scarcely believe that you two
are famous walkers, Monsieur Clifton!"</p>

<p>She turned quickly away.</p>

<p>Was it a mistake&mdash;or had she deliberately called him
Clifton? And had there come a sudden instant of change in her face
in that same moment&mdash;or was it his imagination of the illusive
shadowings of the twilight?</p>

<p>She seated him opposite her at the narrow camp table over which
Barnabe had suspended a gasoline lamp. Joe was beside her and
Gaspard was at one end and Friar Alphonse at the other. And the
lamp was so hung, or her chair so placed beneath it, that her hair
was lighted up gloriously in its radiance.</p>

<p>He looked at her, and the little god of unchained thought came
to his tongue again.</p>

<p>"It is lovely, Mademoiselle. How fortunate is the wind!"</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said, and bowed her head a little. "You are
observing&mdash;and appreciative, Monsieur Clifton"&mdash;and this
time he knew there was no error or slip of tongue in the quiet and
deliberate way in which she spoke his name.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p>Near them Barnabe had built up the fire and later in the glow of
this fire Antoinette St. Ives sat brushing out her hair, apparently
oblivious of Clifton's presence and interested only in Joe and Bim.
The hound lay at her feet while Joe sat cross-legged on the ground
where he could look at her as one after another she brushed out her
curls and talked to him.</p>

<p>The monk was gone. In the circle of light Gaspard discussed with
Barnabe the fine points of the big black gelding, and a little
beyond it the cook was cleaning up the supper things. Though
touching elbows with his company Clifton felt the spell of
aloneness upon him. It had been that way at supper. After the two
thrilling moments in which she had called him Clifton the girl had
seemed almost to forget him in her attentiveness to Joe. He was
glad Gaspard insisted on pulling him into the discussion about
horses finally, for it gave him a screen behind which he could hide
while he stole occasional glances at Antoinette and the boy.</p>

<p>As she sat with Joe, laughing softly and telling him things of
which Clifton could only now and then catch a word it seemed to him
that one was only a little older than the other in the golden glow
of the jack-pine and poplar. In a moment of anger and forgetfulness
Antoinette St. Ives had spoken the truth, though she had asked his
forgiveness for it afterward. He was older, and the truth weighed
heavily upon him as he looked at the two on the other side of the
fire. She was even nearer to Joe than to him. She drew Joe to her
now, and brushed his hair where an untrained cowlick persisted in
standing up straight, and when she had done this she kissed him on
the tip of his freckled nose and turned her head a little so that
she caught Clifton's eyes upon her. And never had he dreamed she
could look so like a child as in that moment, with her boyish
littleness and her soft red mouth and her hair falling so sweetly
about her face and shoulders.</p>

<p>Then he heard her say, "You must go to bed. It is time, Joe.
Kiss your Uncle Clifton good night&mdash;and when you are ready I
will tuck you in."</p>

<p>So Joe came and held up his face to Clifton.</p>

<p>"She said I should kiss you good night," he apologized, and as
Clifton bent down he added in a whisper, "She makes me get on my
knees and say a prayer. I don't like that!"</p>

<p>"You will&mdash;in time," Clifton assured him. "Whatever she
tells you to do is right, Joe&mdash;dead right."</p>

<p>He walked with the boy to the big tent in which the men-folk
were to sleep, and when he returned Gaspard and Barnabe had left
the fire and Mademoiselle St. Ives was humming a little tune to
herself as she finished the last of her curls. She looked up at him
when he paused at her side.</p>

<p>"I have been sitting over there watching you and thinking of you
as a beautiful child," he said. "Do you mind my saying so&mdash;in
a paternal kind of way?"</p>

<p>"I do mind it&mdash;very much," she replied, attending to her
task again. "I don't trust paternalism in men of your kind and I am
quite sure I do not need it."</p>

<p>"I have come to say good night."</p>

<p>"You might have said it before, Captain Brant."</p>

<p>"A few minutes ago you called me Clifton. Now it is Captain
Brant. Why?"</p>

<p>"You were at my table then. Now you are about to leave on your
return to Metabetchewan."</p>

<p>"I am not going to Metabetchewan," he said.</p>

<p>She was silent but her brush worked faster.</p>

<p>He persisted, bending a little over her. "As one who is
infinitely your superior in age&mdash;yes, as one who has reached
that ripe and even mellow maturity wherein you can safely show a
daughterly interest and compassion I ask you to let me touch your
hair with the tips of my fingers before I say good night."</p>

<p>Before he could straighten up she was on her feet.</p>

<p>"You are unkind to taunt me with that! I have asked your pardon
for words spoken in anger and haste. If you possessed only a little
of Crepin Marrolet's chivalry and gentleness, would you remind me
of them?"</p>

<p>"No. Crepin was an active chap in his day. He would have touched
your hair and asked permission afterward. But this situation is
different. Crepin had youth in his veins, while I&mdash;with almost
forty years behind me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are possessed of a most aggravating senility," helped
Mademoiselle St. Ives, the tilt of her chin beginning to reach the
danger point. "Good night, Captain Brant. I am going to my
tent."</p>

<p>"Not until we have settled about Joe and Bim," objected Clifton
coolly. "They are mine. I paid two hundred dollars for them and I
am going to take them unless you make it right with me. First you
must tell me why you want Joe."</p>

<p>"I need him!" cried Antoinette quickly. "I do, Captain Brant. I
need someone to care for like that. I love Joe. I must have him.
Having him gives me courage&mdash;keeps my mind from other
things&mdash;helps me to&mdash;to&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then you must return to me what I have invested in him, or its
equivalent, Mademoiselle. And I prefer the equivalent."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;you want me to pay?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"What? How much?"</p>

<p>"If I sell Joe, with Bim thrown in, it must be for one of those
curls which you would not allow me to touch with the tips of my
fingers. That is my one and only price."</p>

<p>She had drawn away from him. In the firelight her eyes were a
liquid flame.</p>

<p>"Have you a knife?" she asked chokingly.</p>

<p>He drew one from his pocket and opened a blade.</p>

<p>"It is like a razor," he said. "Be careful!"</p>

<p>The steel glittered. Its sharp edge lay against the curl which
she had gathered in her fingers. Then Clifton called out quickly,
"Stop! I don't want it cut! It can be mine and still remain where
it is. I can then think that a little of you belongs to
me&mdash;and you can have Joe and Bim just the same. I'd rather
have you cut off my finger than cut that!"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;consider it your finger, Monsieur!"</p>

<p>It was done! He could hear the quick little cutting sound even
as a sharper cry of protest came to his lips. It was hard for him
to meet the contemptuous flash in her eyes as she dropped the curl
and the knife at his feet.</p>

<p>"Your finger, Captain Brant," she repeated, and with that she
was going away from him, and he watched her like one stunned by a
blow until she disappeared in her tent.</p>

<p>The naked knife gleamed at his feet. The curl, catching the
light of the fire, lay across the blade that had severed it. He
picked them up and as Barnabe and St. Ives came back he returned
the knife to his pocket and placed the curl in a fold of his
wallet. He would sleep on the sand, he told St. Ives&mdash;and with
this explanation shouldered his pack and left them. He went down to
the shore and continued to walk along the smooth beach. It was
cool, a sweet night filled with more than usual darkness, but not
enough to make his way obscure or difficult. The white sands seemed
to have held something of daylight though clouds had gathered in
the sky. Between two huge rocks he found a place for his pack so
that he could walk without its burden resting on his shoulders.</p>

<p>He had gone a quarter of a mile beyond these rocks when he
discovered he was not alone. Padding softly in the sand behind him
was Bim. He waited and rubbed the hound's head and talked to him a
little before going on. He walked steadily and for a long time, and
like a gaunt shadow Bim kept pace at his heels or his side. He put
miles behind him before he turned. The late moon came up through a
bulwark of ragged clouds. When he came back to the rocks where he
had left his pack it was midnight. He spread out a blanket and sat
down with his back to one of the boulders.</p>

<p>It was Bim, at last, who made him suddenly conscious of
something approaching along the edge of the lake. And then through
a thinner curtain of cloud a pallid light from the moon shone down,
revealing a figure with bent head and slow step walking along the
shore. It was Alphonse the monk. With chin sunken forward on his
chest and hands clasped behind him he passed and disappeared in the
gloom. The ghost of something which was more than solitariness had
seemed to walk with him, and the word of greeting which Clifton
would have spoken stuck in his throat.</p>

<p>Then came light. The mass of cloud that had smothered the moon
was driven on by storm winds high up above the earth and a mellow
radiance illuminated the shore and the silvery unrest of the lake.
He sat rigidly as he saw the monk returning.</p>

<p>The bent and solitary figure passed near him again, and a
hundred paces from him it turned once more; and after that, with
head never lifting itself to the sky and shoulders that seemed to
droop more and more as the minutes sped the monk passed and
repassed the two big rocks until in the moonlight Clifton could see
the path made by his feet in the smooth sand near the water's edge.
It was Bim who broke the tense stillness after that. A smothered
howl rose in his throat. For a few moments Friar Alphonse gave no
sign that he had heard it. Then he faced the rock and saw Clifton
sitting with his back against it.</p>

<p>Clifton stood up, and as the two met in a light that was
fighting its way once more through a thickening mask of cloud the
monk's thin face made him think of a death's-head advancing out of
a sea of gloom. Its eyes amazed him. He could see them burning,
even in half darkness. But the monk's voice, when he spoke, was so
soft and quiet that it bore almost the thrilling contrast of
madness.</p>

<p>"Pardon, Monsieur, if I have disturbed you. It is a night of
unrest with the shifting possibilities of quicksilver between the
earth and the sky, and I cannot sleep."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Clifton. "I think it is going to storm."</p>

<p>They were looking at each other, and the little monk smiled
while his eyes held their strange light. He had found something in
Clifton's face that made him place a hand on the other's arm.</p>

<p>"It is the kind of night and the hour in which a man may measure
himself well," he said. "I have been doing that. And so have you.
What conclusion have you arrived at, friend?"</p>

<p>"That I am a fool and very much smaller than I ever thought
myself to be," said Clifton. "And you?"</p>

<p>"Let us walk," said the monk.</p>

<p>And so side by side they went up the shore in darkness that was
thickening swiftly about them, with Bim a silent shadow behind.</p>

<p>And after a little Friar Alphonse answered the question which
Clifton had asked.</p>

<p>"I have discovered myself to be a man," he said, and in his
voice lay a ghostly whisper of tragedy. "And so, being that and
nothing more, I must return to a monastery&mdash;after our task up
here is done. That is what this night has revealed to me!"</p>

<p>For a space Clifton found nothing to say, and he looked up where
the moon was blotted out and felt himself walking hand in hand with
a spirit that was prisoned in strange torment in the twisted body
of the man who walked with him.</p>

<p>At last he said, "I am leaving the St. Iveses in the morning to
travel more quickly into the north. It may be I will not see you
again for a long time."</p>

<p>"You are going to the depots and the woods?"</p>

<p>"I am taking charge up there."</p>

<p>"And are leaving sooner than you had planned?"</p>

<p>"A little, yes. But I shall meet Gaspard at Saint
F&eacute;licien on the day he appoints for his battle with Ajax
Trappier. I have promised that."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;Saint F&eacute;licien and Ajax Trappier,"
muttered the monk. "You must meet again there. But something is
hurrying you away, friend&mdash;the happening on the road this
evening and that other beside the camp-fire tonight&mdash;" His
voice choked suddenly in his throat.</p>

<p>"You know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She told me of her words with you when I came, and found her
crying. And that last in the firelight I saw&mdash;and heard. You
are running away from Antoinette St. Ives."</p>

<p>"She will be happier for that."</p>

<p>"Blind!" muttered the monk, as if to himself. "Blind&mdash;while
I can see so clearly! She might have struck you. But she did not do
that. She gave you the thing for which you asked. If she had done
that for me I would have thanked God all my life, even though she
flung it at my feet as she did to you."</p>

<p>"It was my price for Joe and Bim," said Clifton, staring hard to
make out the face of his companion in the dark.</p>

<p>"And with it she gave you her heart."</p>

<p>The monk's hand touched his and the chill of it was that of a
bloodless thing.</p>

<p>"I have known Antoinette St. Ives from little girlhood," he
added gently. "She loves you."</p>

<p>"Impossible," said Clifton after a moment. "I am so sure of it
that I wish you would relieve me of&mdash;this"&mdash;and he
fumbled in his wallet until he found the curl, and placed it in the
ice-cold hand of Friar Alphonse.</p>

<p>A flash of lightning cut the sky far in the west and a sombrous
roll of thunder accompanied it, while a silence so great fell for a
space about them that even the murmuring unrest of the lake seemed
hushed. In that silence Clifton knew that he had guessed the truth.
He had felt the passionate closing of his companion's hand about
the curl, and now the little monk's breath had stopped, and he
stood like a dead man in the darkness. Blackness hid the tragedy.
But Clifton's hand reached out and found the other's bent shoulder,
and rested gently there.</p>

<p>"You, too, love her?" he whispered softly.</p>

<p>"More than life&mdash;more than God," said the monk, and his
voice seemed strangely far away and very cold, as if coming out of
a fathomless place from which all passion and life and warmth had
died. "I loved her as a child, when my back was broken in the
Mistassini. I love her now as a woman. May God forgive me and
cleanse my soul of its sin!"</p>

<p>"It is not sin," said Clifton, but as he spoke Friar Alphonse
drew away from under his hand, and after a little when Clifton
called his name there came no answer. He reached out gropingly in
the darkness, and called again.</p>

<p>"Alphonse&mdash;Friar Alphonse&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could hear Bim sniffing in the sand. But the monk, if he was
near, made no sound. The lightning came again. It showed inky
ramparts of cloud in the sky. The wailing of wind high up was like
the droning of a distant waterfall and Clifton knew there was more
than rain in the night.</p>

<p>"The storm will soon be upon us. Let us go to Gaspard's tent,"
he said.</p>

<p>Only Bim answered him, making a sound with his jaws as he
followed. Clifton guessed his distance, and turning away from the
beach stumbled across higher ground. Then a point of light appeared
to guide him, a lantern in Gaspard's tent, and he waited once more,
staring back into the gloom out of which he had come. A huge drop
of rain fell on his hand, another on his face. He could hear the
distant moaning of wind and rain as they advanced together, and
half ran up the slope to beat them. Antoinette's tent, without a
light, was lost in a chaos of darkness. Probably she was asleep. He
wondered if Joe was with her and if she was afraid of storm.</p>

<p>He entered Gaspard's tent quietly. It was a big tent, with ample
room for half a dozen sleepers. The lantern was burning low. Its
light revealed St. Ives sprawled out on his eiderdown robe, sound
asleep. Barnabe and the cook were snoring gently. Joe was curled up
on a pile of blankets near them. Another bed, which must have been
for Friar Alphonse, was empty.</p>

<p>The rain began beating like little hammers against the
canvas&mdash;a thousand tiny fists demanding entrance, seeking
shelter from the fury that was driving them on. Then came the
deluge. Clifton sat down, making himself comfortable with his back
against a box, and he wondered what kind of shelter the monk had
found. Years ago he had spent a night like this in the sticky clay
country east of Lake Saint John and had nearly died of mud and
water. He could still taste clay and feel it at times like an
adhesive plaster all about him. Even Flanders could not compare
with that clay of the East Shore, and the rain that came to smother
him in it.</p>

<p>But this was worse&mdash;that is, the rain was. It came in a
solid sheet. The tent sagged under it, and he wondered how the
others could sleep through it together with the thunder and
lightning. The inundation passed on over the lake and wind followed
it&mdash;a biting, snapping wind filled with fierce maelstroms and
eddies and with a growing roar behind it that made Clifton get up
on his feet again.</p>

<p>He roused St. Ives with the toe of his boot. The other sat up,
stripped to his pajamas.</p>

<p>"The devil!" he said, his ears filled with the tumult.</p>

<p>"A hurricane, or the edge of one," said Clifton, getting a
searchlight out of his pack. "If it hits us the tents won't hold.
You'd better go to your sister."</p>

<p>St. Ives jumped up and flung off his sleeping garments. In a
moment of stark nakedness he made a dive for his clothes, and in
that same moment all the savagery of the night was upon them.
Clifton had a swift glimpse of changing things. He saw Joe and
Barnabe and the cook suddenly waking as if struck by whips, and of
the three Joe was on his feet first, with eyes popping. The roar
was deafening, a shrieking, monstrous thing that seemed to be
tearing the earth as well as the air into bits.</p>

<p>Then the end of the tent burst in like an exploding balloon. It
had all happened in those few seconds of St. Ives's nakedness, and
the last of Clifton's vision was filled with Gaspard's hugeness
struggling with a garment. It was then the lantern went out,
smashed all in an instant, and the tent fell about them, wrapping
them in its sodden folds like a living thing.</p>

<p>He was conscious of crying out loudly to Joe, telling him not to
be frightened but to remain quietly under the canvas that had
flattened them all to the earth. He had himself gone down as if
struck by a club and was flat on his back, clutching the flashlight
in one hand. Close to him he could hear St. Ives cursing above the
roar of the hurricane at being caught in such a mess without even
his nightdress on. By shouting at the top of his voice he got
Gaspard's attention.</p>

<p>"I'll care for Antoinette," he yelled. "You stay here with
Joe!"</p>

<p>He began fighting his way out, twisting over on his face, and
for two or three minutes was hopelessly tangled in a pocket made by
the side and the roof of the tent coming together. But he got
himself out at last. There was less roaring about him and he could
hear the sound charging steadily eastward, like a bull half as big
as the earth itself. In the wake of the wind came rain again. It
fell steadily and straight down. The lake was moaning. There was
moaning in the air. The whole world seemed moaning. The strange
part of it was that all the wind was now either far away or high up
in the darkness overhead. There was scarcely a breeze against his
cheek.</p>

<p>He shot his flashlight here and there as he gathered his wits
and a sense of direction. Then he ran, and stumbled upon the canvas
of Mademoiselle St. Ives's tent. It was flat, beaten down and
utterly sodden. He heard a faint voice. "Gaspard!" it was calling.
"Gaspard!"</p>

<p>"I'm here!" he sung out. "Don't be frightened!"</p>

<p>He had never known that canvas could be so devilish. He pulled
and heaved and tore at it without apparently making headway, and
all the time he could hear Antoinette's voice in terror as she
called her brother's name. It did not enter his head to correct
that error&mdash;not even when at last he found an entrance and
felt a pair of arms clasping him convulsively about the neck. But
at the same time he did find a blanket and had the presence of mind
to wrap it about the girl's slender body as he drew her out and
picked her up in his arms. In that moment he had a vision of a
habitant's home a quarter of a mile down the road.</p>

<p>"I'll take you there," he shouted, telling her about it.
"Everybody's all right in the other
tent&mdash;Joe&mdash;everybody&mdash;"</p>

<p>She still thought he was Gaspard. The rain beat on them. The
moaning tumult was about them. And her head was half buried in the
blanket.</p>

<p>He held her closely, so closely that she seemed all pressed
against his breast. Her arms tightened about his neck. He felt her
face, warm, soft, wet. Her mouth was so near his own that he kissed
it, and so sweet and wonderful was the experience that he kissed it
again.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened," he cried, but he did not speak too
loudly.</p>

<p>Her face nestled against his cheek and neck as he started toward
the road with her. He had dropped his flashlight, and if he had
possessed two lives he would have given one of them for miles of
darkness and storm. His lips touched her hair, and he kissed that.
Then he kissed her eyes, one after the other.</p>

<p>"Dear Gaspard!" he heard her say.</p>

<p>His heart was suffocating him, his blood dancing with madness.
He found the road. One of Antoinette's hands caressed his cheek.
Out of the blanket she was asking him about Joe, Friar Alphonse,
the other tent, and&mdash;last&mdash;<i>Clifton Brant</i>! Her hand
pressed his cheek a little harder when she came to that name. He
bent down, with his ear almost at her lips, so he would not lose a
word.</p>

<p>"I hope he never comes back," she cried. "If he does you must
get rid of him for me, Gaspard. I hate him!"</p>

<p>He hugged her tighter, and made no other answer. But that
pressure of her little form in his arms carried sympathy and
understanding&mdash;an affirmative response without words.</p>

<p>The rain had lulled. Now it came again in a sudden spurt. In
that downpour he could use his voice again&mdash;safely, deepening
it as much as he could, like Gaspard's.</p>

<p>"You won't see him again after tonight," he said. "He is going
away&mdash;for good."</p>

<p>He felt his precious burden grow suddenly a little tense against
him. There was silence&mdash;silence of a full half-minute as he
trod along through water and puddles of liquid sand, though he knew
she had heard him clearly. "He is a scoundrel," he added, with the
bitterness of a hateful truth. "It is unfortunate that he loves
you!"</p>

<p>The blanket, the rain, the moaning of the wind, the slush of
water under his feet all helped to keep his secret.</p>

<p>He walked faster, bowing his face in her wet hair, caressing it
softly with his lips. She felt and sensed his solicitude, his
tenderness and adoration. It was a glorious thing in a brother, and
in another lull of rain her hand lay against his cheek again.</p>

<p>Only a little distance ahead was the habitant's home. A few
minutes more and it would be over&mdash;and after that would follow
years and years of life in which he would think of this night. How
mistaken Friar Alphonse had been! Love him? She despised him,
loathed him. But she would never be able to rob him of this
quarter-mile of mud and water and darkness, with her in his arms.
Tomorrow she would learn the truth, of course&mdash;or, possibly,
tonight. In her opinion there would then be little to choose
between himself and Ivan Hurd.</p>

<p>In the blackness ahead he saw a light where the habitant's
all-night kerosene lamp was burning. Then came a sudden blur. Wind
and rain broke out of the west in a fresh fury, and he twisted the
blanket about Antoinette until only an air-space for her mouth was
left open. He heard her cry out for him to let her down that she
might walk, but he held her closer and made headway a yard at a
time in the teeth of the storm. Then he turned in, found a picket
fence, a gate, and came up panting and half drowned to the shelter
of the cottage. The door was not locked and as he opened it he
called loudly to awaken the owners of the place.</p>

<p>He entered boldly, a miracle of change sweeping over him. Now
that it was over he would not try to hide himself. To wait for
tomorrow to reveal his hypocrisy would be cowardly. He had stolen
love, but he would not run away with his pilfering like a
sneak-thief with somebody's pocketbook. That thought came to him
suddenly.</p>

<p>The room was dimly lighted and he stopped in the middle of it
with his burden. Mademoiselle St. Ives was entirely enveloped in
her blanket. The water ran from them in streams and gathered
quickly in pools on the white-scrubbed board floor under their
feet. From an adjoining room a man and woman looked out, wide-eyed
and startled, in nightgowns that fell to their toes.</p>

<p>Clifton did not speak. The situation would be clear in a moment,
and he would leave the girl to explain. Against the wall was an old
sofa, and he placed her on this.</p>

<p>First he saw her little bare feet. Then the water-soaked blanket
fell aside so that her head and shoulders were revealed, and one
white, bare arm that was shivering. She was wet, drippingly wet.
Her curls clung heavily against her face and neck. Clifton wanted
to fall on his knees. But he waited stiffly in the lamplight, water
running from him everywhere. She was smiling&mdash;trying to laugh
in the face of such ridiculous misfortune. Then she saw him, and
her eyes were suddenly ablaze with horror and incredulity.</p>

<p>"<i>You!</i>" she gasped.</p>

<p>She did not notice the man and woman&mdash;did not even see them
as they came through the door. She hid her bare arm. Her fingers
clutched at the wet blanket, hugging it to her. If eyes could have
killed, Clifton would have fallen dead. He was sure of that.</p>

<p>He backed to the door, bowing a little&mdash;a drenched,
wind-blown, disreputable-looking scoundrel if the way she was
looking at him was a reflection of the truth. He was lost now, so
completely that his face was dead-white under its trickle of water.
The lips and eyes he had kissed were damning him, though after that
one word of amazement and shock Antoinette St. Ives did not speak
again. As he opened the door he did not look at her.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Mademoiselle," he said.</p>

<p>Storm and blackness roared their welcome to him. He went out and
the door slammed behind him. And as he found the road again he
thought of Friar Alphonse the monk, and knew what it was at last to
have a heart without hope and a soul that was dead.</p>

<p>Yet in the face of it he smiled, for no power on earth or in
heaven could take away from him the warmth and softness of the lips
and eyes he had kissed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p>Wind died away. A warm drizzle followed the deluge. Then came a
clearing sky, the crowing of roosters at the habitant's
farm&mdash;and the beginning of dawn.</p>

<p>In that first glow of light the big tent was set up, and Clifton
settled a matter definitely with St. Ives.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle and you will need at least two weeks to do your
work between here and Saint Methode," he said. "In one way or
another your sister must become acquainted with every habitant in
the valley while I am working along the Mistassini. I shall go
across from Roberval. Twenty days from today I will meet you at
Saint F&eacute;licien and help you settle your affair with Ajax
Trappier."</p>

<p>A decisive note was in his voice which settled matters without
argument, and St. Ives felt and saw the change. "I feel I am back
in uniform again," he explained when he saw that Gaspard was a
little puzzled. "Until now ours has been a pleasant adventure, a
kind of preparatory holiday. But the real business begins from this
morning. If Jeannot and his hydroplane are in Roberval night will
find me in Laurentian headquarters on the Mistassini."</p>

<p>It was still morning twilight when he walked into
Metabetchewan.</p>

<p>He roused Tremblay and they hunted up a man who had an
automobile for hire. A flush of rose was in the sky when they drove
out the road going north and west.</p>

<p>They passed the drenched camp. Barnabe and the cook were working
about a smoky fire of damp wood. Antoinette's tent was up and he
saw Gaspard hanging wet things on a line. There was no sign of Joe
or the monk. He waved a hand and heard Gaspard's shout. Then came
the habitant's cottage, and he told the driver to slow down. It was
a happy place&mdash;he could see that. The French farmer's passion
for color and flowers revealed itself everywhere about it. The
little house was banked with flowers. Double rows of them ran down
to the gate and the picket fence was streaming with
morning-glories. It was a cleanly whitewashed cottage with vivid
green doors and blinds and red chimneys and the pickets in the
fence were white with red caps. The barn was white with red doors
slashed by green bars. Smoke was coming out of the cottage chimney
and also from a big outside oven which was large enough to hold a
small wagonload of bread at one baking.</p>

<p>As they went on, and the sun rose, and people came to life, the
primitiveness and simplicity of the world they were in together
with its rain-washed cleanness and beauty filled Clifton with a
comfort which he felt no physical or mental torture could ever
quite wipe out entirely. Here there were no crowds. The habitants'
homes seemed far apart, with great reaches of meadow and slope and
valley between them, and the little villages, each with its single
street along the highway, were like rare old paintings come into
drowsy, peaceful life. At times it seemed to him the presence of
their automobile with its noise and odor of gas was almost a
desecration.</p>

<p>Thank God he was not a religious fool and could see that here
the little churches with their welcoming doors and the priests with
their sunny faces and undying cheer had achieved a work which he
had not been able to find anywhere in the outside world of
money-madness, social rot and mechanical insanity. For here in this
little world that nestled like a paradise around Lake Saint John
were peace and love and good will toward men and the soul-inspiring
presence of faith and an abiding happiness. What more could God
Himself give, though all the fanatical religious intolerants on
earth lifted their rabid voices in a scream against thoughts and
methods and preachings which did not follow their own narrow-gauge
line of mentality?</p>

<p>About him were the living symbols of Christ's richly beautiful
vocabulary&mdash;seed, light, leaven, life; and that these people
had ox-carts instead of trucks, horses in place of automobiles, and
clean air, sunshine and green trees instead of belching factory
chimneys&mdash;and a Church that believed in children&mdash;were
not in Clifton's eyes evidence of soul retrogression. Alexis, who
sat beside him, might believe in ghosts and miracles and never have
seen Quebec&mdash;but Alexis also believed in God.</p>

<p>They went on and came to the sleepy edge of Roberval.</p>

<p>He did not find Jeannot, but the Peribonka boat was leaving at
noon, which gave him time to purchase the bush necessities he
required. At four o'clock that afternoon Samuel Chapdelaine was
driving him across the blueberry plains in a horse and buggy and he
ate supper at the Company's depot on the Mistassini.</p>

<p>Eugene Bolduc, the manager at Mistassini, had maps, figures and
information awaiting him. They added a hundred details to what
Colonel Denis had told him in Quebec, and until after midnight the
two sat up and worked over them.</p>

<p>Eugene continued to add to the apparent hopelessness of the
situation, and at times the blood seemed almost ready to burst out
of the veins in his forehead. From the Lake Saint John country both
companies were compelled to use the same trails for sixty miles,
and he and his brother Delphis had counted every head that had gone
up under the Hurd contracts. Only a hundred and fourteen had gone
in, yet there were two hundred and fifty in the woods. That meant
Hurd was sending in men through the mountains and back ways,
secretly and with sinister purpose. He was gathering an army and
hiding its strength from the Laurentian people.</p>

<p>To do this he had a detail of twenty rangers patrolling the
boundaries and no man without a written permit in his pocket could
enter the concessions. So strict was this surveillance that Delphis
had gathered most of his information at night. And up the north
trail an enormous amount of material had gone in for the Hurd
people. Tons of dynamite, for instance. Whole wagon-trains of food
supplies. Thirty horses were at work in the camps and on the
trails. Six of these teams had worked for the Laurentian company
last year.</p>

<p>Eugene was sweating when he came to these details. It was enough
to make a man sweat, he said, and he was only beginning to tell the
worst of it. In the face of all this early activity in the camps of
their enemy the Laurentian camps were positively dead. Only
forty-two men were in the woods, including fire-rangers and a gang
of six engineers, as against Hurd's two-hundred and fifty. As early
as this, six of their last year's jobbers had signed Hurd
contracts, bought over by bonuses which did not appear on their
papers.</p>

<p>At least forty of the hundred and fourteen men who had gone in
were last year's Laurentian men. Those who were entering by way of
the mountains and back ways were strangers. Delphis knew none of
them. But they were a tough lot, only partly French&mdash;many of
them from Ontario. Delphis had heard that others were coming a
little later from Maine. Eugene clearly showed his distress. He
doubted if the Laurentian company would have a hundred men in the
woods by snow time, while at the rate they were going the Hurd-Foy
company would have five hundred. With those odds against them and
hemmed in as they were on both sides and below, what chance could
they have when the spring drive came?</p>

<p>In his opinion unless something was done&mdash;and done
quickly&mdash;the Laurentian company might as well burn its camps
and give up.</p>

<p>The icy coolness with which Clifton received all this
disheartening information rather upset Eugene. When he had
finished, Clifton wrote a brief letter to Colonel Denis, in which
he said, "I am sure my talk with Eugene Bolduc has given me a good
vision of the situation. It is interesting. I like it. We are going
to beat Hurd."</p>

<p>He showed these lines to Eugene, and for a moment the Frenchman
stared at him. Then with an exclamation of joy he gripped his hand.
"<i>Par Dieu</i>, that is what we have been saying&mdash;Delphis
and I!" he cried. "Maybe we have grown a bit disheartened, but with
you to help us we will keep up that cry forever. By the Saints,
Monsieur, I know now that we are going to beat this black curse of
a Hurd!"</p>

<p>The next day saw Clifton and Eugene on their way north. At the
first camp they were joined by Delphis, a man whose leathery visage
and sinewy body seemed made out of whipcord. Each day after that
added to the mass of facts which Clifton was gathering. From the
beginning he made himself one of the men, eating and sleeping with
them and accepting no privileges which all could not enjoy. They
liked him. First impressions grew swiftly into real friendships,
and by the end of the first week he began to see about him the
beginning of an organization in which he could place his
confidence.</p>

<p>He was frank with the men. Individually and collectively he told
them what Hurd's motives were and that the Laurentian Company was
fighting for its life. On the evening of the tenth day he held a
mass meeting at the main depot and with maps and blue-prints
explained in detail just how the Hurd-Foy gangs expected to drive
them out of the woods. He made no effort to screen the
desperateness of the situation. He appealed not only to their pride
and honor but to the fighting instinct which lives in the breast of
every man who is a part of the forests. Fiercely Delphis told what
he knew about the foreigners Hurd was bringing in, and their
contempt for the French woodsmen.</p>

<p>"The <i>canaille</i>!" he cried. "Shall we let them buy us? And
if they cannot buy us, shall we let them drive us out?"</p>

<p>A roar of voices applauded him.</p>

<p>There were forty in the big store-room of the depot, which had
been cleared for the purpose. Clifton was more than satisfied.
These men who had already remained loyal against the advances of
his enemy would stand with him to the last. He was sure of that.
They were only a handful, forty against six times their number as
the odds were figured against them tonight&mdash;but such a forty!
He looked into their blazing faces, from youth to bearded age, and
counted hearts beating as eagerly and as swiftly as his own. Around
this forty he would build his fighting machine. His enthusiasm was
like a fire as he told them how he would do it, and what he
expected. Then he called upon them for individual expressions of
opinion, and among those who rose to their feet was a ragged giant
as huge as Gaspard St. Ives, who bellowed through a beard as red as
fire that he hoped the Devil would take his soul if he lived to run
from all the foreigners that could be crowded between the St.
Maurice and the State of Maine.</p>

<p>This man's name was Romeo Lesage, and the following morning
Clifton and the Bolducs added him to their private council, and
made him their chief fighting man. It was Romeo's suggestion which
made Clifton write to Colonel Denis and ask among other things for
the immediate shipment of one hundred baseball bats.</p>

<p>During the next week Clifton slept not more than half a dozen
hours out of the twenty-four, and each day he saw improvement in
the definiteness and morale of his organization. Men began
dribbling in. Samuel Chapdelaine sent up two families including six
men from Peribonka. From the Roberval office then came copies of
the first contracts signed by Antoinette St. Ives. They were a
pleasurable shock to Clifton. Men followed&mdash;men, women and
children, and especially children. Each jobber had from two to six.
One had seven. The Bolducs were amazed. Clifton was alarmed as well
as astonished. This, of all years, was not a year for women and
children in the woods. It was bound to be a winter of disturbance
and fighting, possibly of extreme tragedy.</p>

<p>Early in September the climax came when two young women arrived
at the Mistassini headquarters. They were extremely nice to look
at. One gave Clifton a letter addressed to himself. It was very
brief, very much to the point, and signed by Antoinette St.
Ives.</p>

<p>Dear Sir [it began stiffly]: We need women and children in the
woods this winter. Their presence will be a curb on Satan and an
inspiration to their men. Wherever a man's woman and child are,
there also is his home. Each jobber will have a camp, and in his
camp from six to a dozen men. The women and children in these camps
will be our chief allies. Therefore I am arranging jobbers'
contracts with men who have large families.</p>

<p>The two young women who will give you this letter are good
Quebec friends of mine. They are school-teachers. You will note the
new clause in the contracts which guarantees that four schools
shall be built at central locations, and that in each school the
children in its vicinity shall receive instruction three days out
of each week. Please have these buildings put up at once, and make
each large enough for concerts, recitals and religious services.
Also give Miss Clamart and Miss Gervais every opportunity to become
acquainted with the mothers and their children. I suggest placing
at their disposal two riding-horses, and, until they are familiar
with the trails, competent guides.</p>

<p>And the letter ended coldly,</p>

<p>"Yours truly, A. St. Ives."</p>

<p>Clifton read the letter twice before he dared look up at
Mesdemoiselles Clamart and Gervais. He wondered if in all his life
he had seen prettier teeth than those that were smiling at him.
Antoinette had shown exquisite judgment in the selection of her
friends!</p>

<p>"I am Anne Gervais," smiled one.</p>

<p>"And I am Catherine Clamart," said the other, in a voice that
was liquid music.</p>

<p>"And we have heard so much about you, Monsieur Clifton, that I
am a bit awed and frightened," said the one who called herself
Anne, and whose dark eyes were pools of laughter as she looked at
him.</p>

<p>"Indeed we are," agreed the other, with a pretty bowing of a
head that caught soft golden lights.</p>

<p>"Through Colonel Denis, of course," added Anne.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Colonel Denis&mdash;of course," parroted the golden
Catherine, and it seemed to Clifton that her blue eyes were
laughing the truth at him already.</p>

<p>"You mean," he nodded, "that Mademoiselle St. Ives has properly
warned you against me?"</p>

<p>"Our honor pledges us to secrecy&mdash;except that we believe
you to be a very desperate man," said Anne, and jet-black lashes
covered her eyes for an instant. Clifton's heart gave a little
jump. Next to Antoinette she was the loveliest girl he had ever
seen!</p>

<p>He felt himself coloring.</p>

<p>"In spite of which I'll build the schools," he said.</p>

<p>Anne unveiled her eyes. She took off her boyish hat, carelessly
revealing the glossy richness of her thick dark hair, and Clifton
walked between the two as he escorted them to a cabin which was
built and furnished especially for company guests. And Catherine
took her hat in her hand, as Anne had done, so that looking down on
one pretty head and then on the other he observed, as any man not
utterly blind must have done, the lovely coils of hair which the
hats had concealed, on one head velvety black and on the other soft
gold. Scarcely had he made note of this pleasant fact when Anne
looked up at him with disturbing quickness and caught his
admiration trying to hide itself like a thief in his face.</p>

<p>He left them at the cabin and instructed the depot clerk to see
that everything was done for their comfort. Then he sought the
privacy of the manager's office and found Eugene ahead of him, his
big body shrinking back in the desk chair while over him stood a
mysterious and weather-worn figure enthusiastically threatening his
life.</p>

<p>"And on top of that may the Devil take your soul and stand it on
end if you so much as open your mouth in the matter," this
individual was saying. "And also on top of that&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned about suddenly as Clifton entered.</p>

<p>It was Alphonse the monk.</p>

<p>Instantly his thin face was crinkling in a smile and he held out
his two hands as if about to give a benediction. He was even
thinner than when Clifton had last seen him. His clothes were
ragged and his hair had grown lank and uneven about his ears.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, dear Clifton, for disturbing your ears with this
excoriation of a hopeless sinner," he cried. "He took me for a
tramp and not a priest and I have put him properly in his
place."</p>

<p>Clifton seized the little man's hands, and in his amazement his
first words were, "You came with <i>them</i>?"</p>

<p>"With whom?" asked the monk.</p>

<p>"Mesdemoiselles Gervais and Clamart."</p>

<p>"The two pretty demoiselles I saw through your windows? The
Saints forbid! It is my opinion the dark-haired wench is unsafe to
travel with, unless one carries with him a potion against the
witchcraft of black lashes and the bottomless pools they sometimes
cover."</p>

<p>"You have noted her closely," grunted Clifton.</p>

<p>"Very," said Alphonse, unabashed. "I scarce noticed the other.
If Mademoiselle St. Ives knew this dark-eyed one was here, with
lashes black as jet and half as long as her finger&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She sent them," interrupted Clifton, and he gave Antoinette's
letter to the monk.</p>

<p>Alphonse read the letter slowly and with undisguised amazement,
and when he was done he stood for a full half-minute staring at
nothing at all through the window.</p>

<p>"It may be she is right, Monsieur," he said then.</p>

<p>"Surely men alone cannot win for us in this fight. I
know&mdash;because for ten days I have been in the camps of the
Philistines, an humble missioner carrying the word of God among
Ivan Hurd's lawless scoundrels, and my eyes have been open and my
ears wide awake night and day." Suddenly his voice filled and his
cavernous eyes burned with a swift flash of excitement and
understanding. "<i>Cher Dieu</i>, I think I perceive what
Antoinette St. Ives has foreseen a million miles ahead of us! There
will be outlawry in the woods this year and mayhap desperate
happenings and fighting and even deaths! The government will
come&mdash;its investigation must come. On one side it will find
Hurd and his political power and his foreigners from Ontario and
Maine. And on ours it will find <i>women and children and schools
and music and the word of God on Sundays</i>. My dear Sainte Anne,
the knell has struck! Justice must be given where there are women
and children and these other things&mdash;even against the might of
Ivan Hurd!"</p>

<p>The little monk's thin hands were atremble and a flush had
gathered in the hollows of his cheeks. Eugene Bolduc had risen to
his feet and seemed to hold his breath as he listened. Clifton felt
his heart throbbing harder against his ribs as the amazing truth of
the thing rushed upon them with a numbing effect. For a few moments
it held them speechless.</p>

<p>The brief interval of silence was broken by laughter and light
footsteps.</p>

<p>Through the open doorway came Anne Gervais. Her cheeks and eyes
were aglow. Her red lips seemed painted.</p>

<p>"Pardon!" she cried. "But, Monsieur&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then, facing her, she saw Alphonse the monk. Instantly words
died on her lips. She drew in a quick breath, and her eyes slowly
widened as she stared at the half bowed, shaven head and unkempt
figure of the little missioner.</p>

<p>Then the monk raised his head and looked at her calmly.</p>

<p>"It is me you should pardon," he said gently. "I can see that
you are shocked, child, at beholding a member of the priesthood in
such disreputable attire, but Monsieur Brant will tell you I have
just come in from arduous travel in the forest. Are you
Anne&mdash;or Catherine?" And a quizzical smile twisted his face as
he advanced and took her hand, and bowed his broken shoulders a
little over it.</p>

<p>"I am Anne," she said in a low voice that was filled with
relief. "Forgive me, Father. Won't you come to our cabin? We have
soap and towels, and it will be a pleasure for us to serve
you."</p>

<p>"I will come," said the monk without hesitation. "Monsieur
Clifton, you will surely excuse us, for such unexpected happiness
and promise of comfort I cannot put away from me. Gladly would I
place this lovely Anne on the calendar of saints if I had the
power!"</p>

<p>And as he went with Mademoiselle Gervais, without waiting for
Clifton to answer, he turned and added in a low voice over his
shoulder:</p>

<p>"Remember, Monsieur. <i>This is the eighteenth day</i>."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p>Clifton turned to Eugene and found him staring through the
window.</p>

<p>"He fills me with chills, like a dead man's ghost," said Eugene,
without looking behind him. "And he left me a curse strong enough
to loosen the teeth in my head if my tongue forgets itself! What
did he mean by that eighteenth day, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"It was a reminder that I am contracted to meet Gaspard St. Ives
in Saint F&eacute;licien on the twentieth day after my departure
from Metabetchewan," explained Clifton.</p>

<p>"He is talking with great earnestness to Mademoiselle Gervais,"
grunted Eugene.</p>

<p>"I don't blame him," said Clifton.</p>

<p>"And they have swerved from the path that leads to the cabin and
are wandering toward the big rocks at the river's edge."</p>

<p>"Which proves him man as well as monk, Eugene."</p>

<p>Eugene turned about with a shrug of his shoulders.</p>

<p>"He has aged ten years since I saw him last, six months ago," he
said. He caught himself almost sharply. "That is why I mistook him
for a vagabond, as you heard him say. He is like a dried-up dead
man walking about. <i>Ugh</i>!" And he shivered.</p>

<p>"You make a poor liar, Eugene," laughed Clifton good-humoredly.
"But I am not curious enough just now to ask questions. I am
excited by all these happenings and what they mean to us. How long
will it take to build the schools? Logs, of course, and say twenty
by forty feet inside measurement."</p>

<p>Eugene set to figuring on a pad of paper.</p>

<p>"Seventy-two logs in each, nine-foot walls, without counting
floor or roof," he said after a few moments. "Six men to a
building, one day for the logs, three for the raising and three for
roof and floor. Seven days, Monsieur, or the four in a month."</p>

<p>"Good!" approved Clifton. "Choose the six men, Eugene&mdash;the
best with ax and saw we have. I'll give you plans and locations at
supper time, and tonight I'll send out an order for four of the
finest little-red-schoolhouse bells that can be bought in Quebec or
Montreal."</p>

<p>He felt a curious sense of elation as he went to his own room,
set off at the end of the building in which were the store and the
office. This feeling was more than optimism. It was the conviction
that something had happened which had completely changed his
footing in the approaching struggle with Hurd. He had feared a
certain crisis; now he found himself looking forward with almost
eager anticipation to the event which had worried him&mdash;the
government investigation which was bound to follow serious troubles
in the woods, and which was equally bound to make somebody pay.
Hurd's gangs might overwhelm the Laurentian men in fighting
strength, but they could not drive out or harm women and
children&mdash;or Antoinette St. Ives or Anne Gervais and Catherine
Clamart. And school bells would be ringing when the government men
came!</p>

<p>At first he accepted this unexpected change in the situation as
the one cause of his rising spirits. But as he shaved himself
another factor came creeping in despite a mental protest which
crumbled away before he had finished one half of his face. This
factor was Anne Gervais&mdash;and behind was Antoinette St. Ives. A
part of Antoinette had seemed to come into the woods with Anne. It
had looked at him out of her bewitching eyes. The poise of her
pretty head made him think of it, the slim likeness of her
body&mdash;and even more than all these things something else which
he could not define, and which was not a part of Catherine, though
a quieter and rarer beauty might be found in the latter. He dressed
himself with unusual care.</p>

<p>After his toilet he spent an hour drawing the plans for a school
and deciding on their locations. Then he went to the guest
cabin.</p>

<p>Evidently the monk had received his grooming and was gone. Anne
and Catherine had slipped into fresh things. It was Anne who filled
Clifton's eyes, though he kept that fact to himself. Outwardly he
may have looked a little oftener at Catherine&mdash;a bit longer at
Anne.</p>

<p>Anne had put on a simple white waist with a simple black tie,
and with this her black hair was parted in the middle and smoothed
like shining silk, with the heavy coil of it on her neck, so that
if Clifton had been an artist he would have thought of but one
picture to paint&mdash;the Mother Madonna.</p>

<p>While they were checking up the schoolhouse plans and talking
business seriously, Anne's face was filled with the gentleness and
sincerity of an angel's.</p>

<p>But when, a quarter of an hour before supper, she walked alone
with Clifton at the edge of the river little devils of mischief
lurked in the corners of her eyes as she looked up at him from
under her long lashes.</p>

<p>"Like all other men who know her, I suppose you have fallen in
love with Antoinette St. Ives," she said, and she put a hand
tightly on his arm to steady herself over the rocks.</p>

<p>"I admire her," said Clifton.</p>

<p>Anne laughed softly, and looking down Clifton saw nothing but
the sheen of her hair and the pink in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I hope she marries Colonel Denis," she breathed gently. "I have
tried to bring about the match for years. But I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" asked Clifton in spite of himself, when she did not
finish.</p>

<p>"That she loves another man," said Anne.</p>

<p>Clifton's heart stopped beating. Against his most powerful
effort his body stiffened.</p>

<p>"And the tragedy of it is that this man is the one man in the
world who does not love her," continued Anne, looking straight
ahead of her. "Is he not a fool?" Before he could force words out
of his thickening throat, Anne asked, "Do you know Monsieur Gaspard
St. Ives?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Very well," said Clifton. "I am to join him day after
tomorrow."</p>

<p>The hand on his arm rested a bit more heavily.</p>

<p>"Where?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I think&mdash;at Roberval," he lied, keeping his
pledge to St. Ives. There was a moment of silence. He looked at his
watch. "Supper is about ready."</p>

<p>They walked back.</p>

<p>"Gaspard St. Ives is an&mdash;an unusually splendid man,"
persisted Anne.</p>

<p>"A prince among them," agreed Clifton, quickly catching at the
way the wind was drifting. "You love him, Mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>"</p>

<p>She faced him, her dark eyes glowing with fire, her cheeks like
wild red phlox. Clifton smiled at her. How amazingly long her
lashes were! Slowly they fell.</p>

<p>"Well, what if I do?" she asked. "Am I to be ashamed of it? Or
shall I pine away and die because he happens not to love me?" And
suddenly her milky teeth were laughing at him and her hand rested
on his arm again. "But there is always hope," she said as they came
to the door of the company dining-room, where Eugene and Catherine
and one of the young engineers were waiting for them, "Remember
that, Monsieur Clifton, when you dream of Antoinette St.
Ives&mdash;<i>there is always hope</i>." And from then until
bedtime she gave him no further opportunity for words alone with
her.</p>

<p>But in the morning, when he was ready to leave with Alphonse for
St. F&eacute;licien so that they might be at the trysting-place
bright and early the second day, she gave him a letter, and with a
fierce little tempest which was not more than a whisper in her
voice she said:</p>

<p>"If it were not for that hateful Angelique Fanchon at St.
F&eacute;licien I could marry Gaspard St. Ives! Will you help me a
little, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Help you?" Clifton felt his heart opening wide to accept her.
Was Gaspard an absolute fool? Would he put away from him a little
angel like Anne Gervais for this plump and strong-headed farmer
girl Angelique Fanchon, no matter how much land or how many cows
and horses her father might own? "I'll help you," he said warmly.
"I'll do everything I can."</p>

<p>"Then give him this letter," said Anne, and she placed a small
sealed envelope in his hand. With a toss of her head she added,
"Angelique Fanchon has made a fool of herself so long that she
doesn't deserve him, and what it is in this stupid Gaspard's head
that keeps him faithful to her I cannot understand. She should be
whipped!"</p>

<p>"I have heard enough to incline me to that same opinion," agreed
Clifton.</p>

<p>Anne looked up sharply. "From whom?" she asked.</p>

<p>"From Gaspard St. Ives, of course, and from Friar Alphonse as
well."</p>

<p>"Oh-h!" said Anne, making a red <i>O</i> of her mouth. "One
would think they had a bad opinion of this Angelique Fanchon, the
wicked thing!"</p>

<p>"They have," helped Clifton. "A very decided opinion. And I hope
this letter from you will take the blindness from that ass of a
Gaspard's eyes, and bring him to you."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Anne faintly. "Good-by, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Mademoiselle."</p>

<p>He looked back from the crest of a hill a quarter of a mile
away, and she was standing where he had left her, before the cabin
in the clearing. She waved a handkerchief to him, and Clifton waved
back, and Alphonse the monk gave a chuckle that was almost a
laugh.</p>

<p>"A pretty wench," he exclaimed, "and one with eyes that would
rock the reason of the Devil! There should be a Church canon
against lashes as long as hers, for they have no righteous place
among men." And he chuckled again.</p>

<p>"I am beginning to think that Gaspard has lost his mind," said
Clifton. "She is adorable."</p>

<p>"A beautiful triumvirate, Monsieur Clifton, counting Antoinette.
The children will love them. Also the women. And I fancy the
schools will be filled when there is dancing or other nonsense. Our
men will fight now, trust <i>them</i>! And it is a God's blessing,
for I have brought information from the Hurd camps which will make
you sick to hear. Ivan Hurd is there."</p>

<p>"The deuce!" cried Clifton.</p>

<p>"He came three days before I left, and with him half a dozen men
who are as ugly-looking dogs as their master. Three of them are
members of parliament, just up to look through the woods so they
can testify to Hurd's splendid activities later on, two are men I
have not been able to mark, and the sixth is Hurd's lawyer from
Montreal."</p>

<p>Clifton drew his trotting horse down to a walk.</p>

<p>"They are planning on six hundred men by the middle of January,"
continued the monk, "and at least four hundred of them will be
Americans and English Canadians&mdash;foreigners from Ontario and
Maine. No matter what we can do, our Church will have little
influence among them. And in the face of declining wages Hurd has
raised last year's scale by twenty percent and is pledging a bonus
of one hundred dollars to every man who sticks until the spring
drive is over. That means a sixty-thousand-dollar bonus plus a
forty-five-thousand-dollar increase in wage. And against all that
we will have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Three girls and four schoolhouses," Clifton finished for him.
"And with good luck two hundred men. <i>Avance donc</i>!"&mdash;and
he touched the horse into a trot again.</p>

<p>A third time Alphonse chuckled.</p>

<p>"Your humor is right, Friend Clifton. Why borrow trouble about
gloomy matters when pleasanter ones are pending?" he philosophized.
"For instance&mdash;tomorrow's bout between Gaspard St. Ives and
Ajax Trappier should be a most agreeable and interesting affair,
out of which, as the ancient saying goes, much honor may be
expected."</p>

<p>"The fight shall not happen if I can prevent it," said
Clifton.</p>

<p>Alphonse almost hopped from his seat.</p>

<p>"You would stop it?"</p>

<p>"I would."</p>

<p>"Then may your teeth ache everlastingly afterward if you
succeed!" the monk shot at him fiercely. "Son, this is to be a
greater fight than when Samson went among the Philistines with the
jaw-bone of an ass! It is to be the greatest fight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That two asses can possibly bring about," agreed Clifton. "But
I think I can stop it when I tell our friend about Anne Gervais and
give him her letter."</p>

<p>"She has written him a letter?"</p>

<p>"I have it in my pocket."</p>

<p>The little monk sank back in his seat. "If this fight is spoiled
I shall never again believe in the virtue of prayer," he said.</p>

<p>And later that day, when the afternoon grew exceedingly warm and
Clifton took off his coat, Alphonse found occasion to purloin the
letter and hide it within the secret folds of his own.</p>

<p>Thereafter his spirits continued to rise until they entered the
little village of Saint Methode, still a three-hour ride from Saint
F&eacute;licien. And scarcely had they passed the priest's house
and the small wooden church and come to the blacksmith's shop, the
store and the little old inn which had a customer once or twice a
week when a roaring voice greeted them joyously, and Gaspard St.
Ives came out with the wild rush of a great Newfoundland dog from
the door of the tavern. Before Clifton was out of the rig he had
him in his arms, and was shaking the monk's two hands till the
little man's bones seemed threatened with dissolution.</p>

<p>"<i>Bon Dieu!</i>" he cried. "I have been waiting since morning,
knowing you had to come by this road. I left my sister at Normandin
yesterday and have not slept a wink since, fearing you had
forgotten your promise. But tonight I shall sleep long and sweetly,
like a baby, and dream pleasantly of Ajax Trappier's cracking
bones. Is there room in this buggy for three, Monsieur
Clifton&mdash;two great men like you and me plus this shriveled
minnow of a monk?"</p>

<p>"Enough," said Clifton, "for as far as we are going. Get
in."</p>

<p>The overweighted buggy made its way out of the village at a
sleepy jog.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Gaspard, making a place for the
half-crushed monk between them.</p>

<p>"For twenty days I have been thinking," said Clifton.</p>

<p>"A most extraordinary task," wheezed the monk.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking," persisted Clifton, ignoring him, "and I
have come to the conclusion that you will be the biggest fool in
Quebec if you fight this fellow at St. F&eacute;licien."</p>

<p>"You think he may beat me?"</p>

<p>"No. Not that. But this Angelique Fanchon, if she is the angel
you have painted her, will think less of you for the fight; and if
she does honor you for it, then she is a most ordinary creature,
and not worthy the dirtying of your hands. How you can allow
yourself to think of her as you do while a real angel like Anne
Gervais is in love with you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anne Gervais!" gasped St. Ives.</p>

<p>"Yes, the school-teacher your sister sent up to our camps along
with Catherine Clamart."</p>

<p>"<i>What</i>! That skinny little Anne Gervais whose eyes give me
a chill every time they look at me! Compare her with my lovely
Angelique Fanchon, would you, Monsieur Brant? You are mad!"</p>

<p>"As daft as a moonstruck loon," added the monk.</p>

<p>"A girl with feet twice as large as my Angelique&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And teeth that can bite through a hickory nut like a
squirrel's," echoed the monk.</p>

<p>"It is monstrous!"</p>

<p>"She is very beautiful," defended Clifton. "Even Alphonse
declared as much, and he spoke of the witchcraft of her
lashes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because they looked hell-born to me," interrupted the monk.
"Pay no attention to what he says, Gaspard. You cannot compare
Angelique Fanchon with this Mademoiselle Gervais any more than you
can set up a golden moon beside a hollow pumpkin with a lighted
candle in it! And as for the fight&mdash;if you turn back now, even
though you may be a little nervous&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nervous?" rumbled St. Ives. "I am only nervous to be at it! I
won't feel like a man again until I have whipped this overgrown
horse-breeder under the very eyes of Angelique herself. That is my
plan, friends, to whip him with Angelique looking on! So let us
hurry, Monsieur Clifton, for I am anxious to find how the land lies
at the Fanchon home. To-morrow is Sunday, the day of all days to
wreak the vengeance of the Lord upon Ajax Trappier!"</p>

<p>"Sweet are the thoughts that savor of content," approved the
monk softly. "All that remains of your arguments, Monseiur Clifton,
is the letter Mademoiselle Gervais placed in your care for our
friend. Give it to him. We will be fair in the stand we have taken,
by all means."</p>

<p>Clifton began searching in the pockets of his coat.</p>

<p>"This Anne Gervais sent a letter to me?" demanded St. Ives
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Yes. A love letter."</p>

<p>"Then God deliver me from it!" said Gaspard.</p>

<p>"It is gone," said Clifton, puzzled. "I have gone through my
pockets twice. If it is lost I shall never forgive myself."</p>

<p>"Probably it fell into the road when you so carelessly put your
coat over the back of the seat," suggested Alphonse.</p>

<p>St. Ives heaved a sigh of relief. "Don't mind it," he said. "It
is profit instead of loss, for the last thing in this world I want
is a letter from Anne Gervais. Will you give me the reins, Friend
Clifton? I shall die of old age unless we make this road a bit
faster."</p>

<p>"Go to it," yielded Clifton. "I'm through and you can make a
fool of yourself if you want to. But I still insist that I wouldn't
trade one Anne Gervais for a hundred of these Angelique Fanchons of
Saint F&eacute;licien!"</p>

<p>And to his amazement the little monk whispered in his ear,
"Neither would I, Friend Clifton, but we must let the Devil have
his way&mdash;<i>this time</i>!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p>An emotion more stirring than thought of the approaching duel,
yet stoically hidden, was in Clifton's breast. He wanted to hear
about Antoinette St. Ives, even though he knew this desire was a
weakness in himself, and he had half hoped that Gaspard would have
something to say which would help to fill the emptiness in his
heart. This feeling had increased since his brief acquaintance with
Anne. That her love for Gaspard was a futile and despised thing was
an absurd miscarriage of what ought to be. He began thinking of her
almost affectionately. Even Antoinette was scarcely sweeter or more
adorable. If there had been no Antoinette...</p>

<p>He jerked himself out of his thoughts as if someone had touched
him with the end of a whip, just as Gaspard spoke the name of his
sister.</p>

<p>"She has changed strangely since that night of the storm," he
said, a puzzled note in his voice. "Possibly it is the strain of
this business with Hurd. When she is not working among the people
she is too much alone with herself, or with Joe. She has an armful
of books and is teaching the boy from them. But along with that she
has become too quiet, and I don't like it."</p>

<p>"Quietness hath its virtue," consoled the monk.</p>

<p>Clifton felt a depressing clutch at his heart. She had changed,
St. Ives had said, since the night of the storm. Probably Gaspard
did not know what had happened that night or he would have hurled
him from the buggy. Now, looking back on it all, he could see how
terribly he must have hurt her. The shameful advantage he had taken
of her must have gone deep down into her heart and soul, like a
blight. With his lips set tight he hated himself, and listened to
St. Ives as he told about their work.</p>

<p>Night and day and Sunday they had been busy, and Gaspard did not
think there was a villager's house or habitant's farm between Point
Bleu and Saint F&eacute;licien they had not visited. Antoinette and
Joe had spent five days at Saint F&eacute;licien, at Angelique's
home, of course. But he had kept away&mdash;had gone to Normandin.
Not for his life would he show his face to Angelique until he had
broken Ajax Trappier.</p>

<p>As his own humor became gloomier that of Gaspard and the monk
rose with each step that shortened the distance between them and
St. F&eacute;licien. It was as if Gaspard was on his way to some
festive event, and Alphonse grew visibly brighter. It seemed that
in some mysterious way he had already arranged for their night's
lodging at a farmhouse which was less than two miles from the
Fanchon home, and about an equal distance from that of Ajax
Trappier, where their presence and mission would be held in strict
confidence. So they avoided the town and came to Adrien Clamart's
on a back road.</p>

<p>Clifton received a pleasant shock. Adrien, who was tall and slim
and blue-eyed, and a married man, was a brother to Catherine
Clamart, who was with Anne Gervais up on the Mistassini. He was in
love with his sister as well as his wife, and shook Clifton's hand
warmly. But he had to agree with St. Ives when Alphonse told about
the difference of opinion regarding Anne Gervais.</p>

<p>"She is disagreeable, and has made a nuisance of herself,
Monsieur, and I cannot blame Gaspard for his stand in the matter,"
he said. "I pity my sister if they are very long together."</p>

<p>Alone in his room that night Clifton took mental stock of
himself. Was it conceivable that in some way he was blinded to the
truth of Anne's personal appearance and qualities? He was puzzled.
He fell asleep on a thick feather bed with Anne's lovely eyes and
her long lashes filling his vision and pleading with him to fight
her battle.</p>

<p>He was awakened early by a knocking at his door. It was seven
o'clock when breakfast was over and he climbed into a buggy with
Gaspard and the monk. Adrien cut across certain fields, and
Adrien's wife kept away from him the shadow of doubt that had grown
in her eyes. Last night they had talked to her about spending this
day together seeing certain people in the interests of the
Laurentian company. But she sensed excitement, even as Clifton
could feel it as he sat next to St. Ives. Not until they were well
away did either the monk or Gaspard give voice to it.</p>

<p>"The good Lord hath blessed us," Alphonse was first to say.
"Madame and Monsieur Fanchon will leave for church at a quarter to
nine, but Angelique&mdash;having received my message saying that
Antoinette is coming at ten&mdash;will remain at home. She is
delighted, Friend Gaspard, to know your sister is making her this
unexpected visit. <i>Mon Dieu</i>, what a lie! But it had to be.
And personally I saw to it that Angelique's note, written by
myself&mdash;a finer woman's hand than mine you never saw,
Monsieur!&mdash;was delivered to Ajax Trappier last night. He will
be on hand in all his splendor at half past nine to take Angelique
for a drive, as the note specially requested. Could that old fox,
Richelieu himself, have done better, Gaspard?"</p>

<p>"You are a treasure, Alphonse!"</p>

<p>"It may be you will have a different opinion of me at half past
ten, when you are beaten up like a bag of hops," exulted the little
monk. "Ajax Trappier is in fine fettle!"</p>

<p>"So am I," boasted Gaspard.</p>

<p>In spite of the disgust which Clifton tried to impose upon
himself he could not keep a growing thrill out of his blood. This
was bound to be a memorable affair, a tremendous combat between two
giants, and if it had not been for a certain dishonesty of action
which seemed to be accompanying it he would have given himself up
more to the spirit of anticipation which animated the monk.</p>

<p>As it was he asked, "And how have you insured yourself that
Mademoiselle Fanchon will witness this fight?"</p>

<p>"I will arrange that," answered the monk. "The battleground is
to be a greensward behind the house, Monsieur, and overlooking it,
not fifty paces away, is a big window filled with flowers. And
among these flowers will be Mademoiselle's face, so that until
Gaspard's eyes are closed shut by Ajax he may see her every time he
looks in that direction. Oh, that is the easiest part of
it&mdash;arranging for Mademoiselle to see her baby Gaspard mauled
unmercifully by this ferocious breeder of horses!"</p>

<p>After a time they entered through a gate into a wood, and in the
heart of this wood they fastened the horse and went on afoot. A few
hundred yards brought them to vast green meadows broken here and
there by trees and thickets. This was the Fanchon farm, and half a
mile across the meadows they came to a smaller wood, and just
beyond this were the great barns and snow-white dwelling. A
distance from the house the three concealed themselves, and St.
Ives and Clifton smoked the time away until, at exactly twenty
minutes of nine, Madame and Monsieur Fanchon drove off in great
style in a rubber-tired buggy behind a high-stepping black horse
whose sleek coat shone like silk even at four hundred yards.
Scarcely were they gone up the road when Alphonse hopped like a
rabbit from his cover.</p>

<p>"Give me twenty minutes!" he cried. "I will then be with
Angelique in the house. After that come up behind the smallest
barn, and make yourself ready, Gaspard. Within another twenty
minutes Ajax Trappier will be driving down the road. And when he
<i>does</i>, Monsieur Clifton, you are to be at the hitching-post
to meet him and will tell him that a gentleman is behind the house
who is very anxious to have a word with him. In that way you will
lead him to the greensward we have mentioned, and Gaspard will
advance at the same time from the barn, so measuring his steps that
the twain shall meet in full view of the big window with flowers in
it. And I swear that if you do these things properly Angelique will
be looking on when the action begins!"</p>

<p>He was gone before even St. Ives had answered him, and Clifton
looked at his watch.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later they sallied forth from the wood, and found
entrance through a back door into the barn. Here without further
loss of time Gaspard began to prepare himself for battle. First he
emptied his pockets of all articles and placed them neatly in a
pile on a barrel-head. Then he began divesting himself of his upper
garments, beginning with his tie and cravat, until his huge body
stood naked to the waist. After that he drew in great breaths and
blew out like a porpoise, and swung his mighty arms until he had
given himself a general loosening up.</p>

<p>Clifton was beginning to enjoy himself. And he was also
beginning to wonder what he would do if Ajax should get the best of
St. Ives. Could he stand quietly by and see the brother of the girl
he loved beaten up under the very eyes of that brother's
sweetheart? He saw himself facing a serious problem.</p>

<p>Then a cloud of dust came shooting swiftly down the road.
Clifton hurried to meet it and arrived at the hitching-post just as
Ajax was making the last leg of the journey at a stupendous speed.
The buggy arrived. It stopped. And Clifton stared.</p>

<p>Never in all his life had he looked upon anything in man-shape
quite equal to the magnificence of Ajax Trappier. The man fairly
glowed and glittered, dimming the glory of his splendid horse and
wire-wheeled <i>voiture</i>. He was big, even bigger than Gaspard.
But he hopped from his vehicle lightly and with debonair
&eacute;clat fastened his horse to the post. He sensed his
importance like a major-domo on parade.</p>

<p>His splendor began not alone with his size, or his fierce black
mustache, or the shine of his polished face, but also with his
cravat, which was a brilliant yellow. From that point down he was a
feast for the eyes. His suit was a tan with whitish stripes, his
vest was black-and-white check, and his shoes were shining enamel.
The sun played on him effulgently. It reflected itself from a huge
jewel in his cravat, from two enormous rings on his fingers, and
from a double-hitch of gold watch-chain that dangled with the
weight of half a pound across his upper abdomen. His chest was
thrown out like a pouter pigeon's as he faced the house.</p>

<p>For the first time he seemed to notice Clifton.</p>

<p>"<i>Bon jour</i>," he said airily, with a greeting smile that
revealed to Clifton the widest, whitest, longest, most powerful set
of teeth he had ever seen.</p>

<p>"<i>Bon jour</i>," responded Clifton; and then he added,
"Pardon, Monsieur, but there is a gentleman back of the house who
will be grateful if you will come around and speak with him for a
moment."</p>

<p>"Ah-h!" said Ajax. "With pleasure!"&mdash;and he passed through
the gate with a splendid flourish, looking out of the corner of his
eye to see if Angelique by any chance was observing him from a
window or a door.</p>

<p>So it happened as the monk had planned, and Ajax came face to
face with Gaspard on the greensward.</p>

<p>And Clifton's heart leaped full into his mouth when he glanced
at the flower-filled window and saw the face of Angelique Fanchon
staring out. It was partly screened, and withdrawn a little from
the glass, but he knew it was Angelique by the wild look of triumph
in Gaspard's face as he first greeted Trappier, and then pointed to
the window. Ajax looked, and swallowed a great gulp. Then he smiled
brightly and gracefully waved a hand to the girl.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Fanchon," said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mademoiselle Fanchon," said St. Ives.</p>

<p>Clifton was amazed by the paucity of words between them.
Evidently the understanding of what would happen when they met was
mutual. There was no abuse, no working up of their passions. In
spite of his fealty to Gaspard, Clifton began to admire his
gorgeous rival. Ajax's smile was a wonder. It was a perpetual
thing, disclosing the deadly weapons behind it&mdash;his great
teeth. He looked about him and calmly plucked a few flowers. These
he carefully placed at a safe distance on the grass.</p>

<p>"I shall put them in your hands when it is over," he said to St.
Ives, and smiled pleasantly at him.</p>

<p>He went into the barn and stripped, while Gaspard strutted up
and down, apparently oblivious of the white and frightened face of
the girl discernible through the flower-room window.</p>

<p>When Ajax returned he was smiling widely and he walked with the
same cheerful animation, though he had on nothing but his trousers
and enamel shoes. It was quite evident that his <i>gaiet&eacute; de
coeur</i> was in no way disturbed by this unexpected incident in
his life. He twisted his mustache as he advanced, and again waved
lightly to the girl in the window. Gaspard was gritting his teeth
to hold back his rage. Nothing could have infuriated him more than
his rival's pleasant behavior and stage-like complacency, and so
fascinated was Clifton that he was almost startled when he heard
the delighted chuckle of the monk close at his side.</p>

<p>"Is not this Ajax Trappier the flower of all flocks?" he asked.
"And look at our Gaspard! A pin-prick and he would go up with a
great explosion, for he is filled to the neck with the desire to
get at this fellow. <i>Bon Dieu</i>, take a look at Ajax's teeth!
They win his battles, Monsieur&mdash;those teeth!&mdash;longer than
a boar's and stouter than iron nails. It is said he can bite a
man's leg half in two with them, and when he lays hold of a man's
ear&mdash;<i>per saltum!</i>&mdash;it is gone."</p>

<p>The two combatants were now facing each other, and for a few
moments they moved slowly about, like two roosters making
observations. Then they hunched themselves over, with a good six or
eight feet between them, and like gorillas, with their heads low
and their arms hanging down, continued their cautious circling.</p>

<p>With these actions began the preliminaries of a habitant
duel.</p>

<p>"So you have come to break my bones, have you, Monsieur St.
Ives?" smiled Ajax without a ruffle in his voice.</p>

<p>"Now that I am here I am going to do more than that," retorted
Gaspard. "With Angelique looking on I am first going to pull out
that greasy mustache of yours."</p>

<p>This was a good hit, for Trappier's mustache was his pride, and
for a flash the smile left his face as they continued to circle
about each other.</p>

<p>"A mustache will grow," he said then, exposing his great teeth
again. "But what are you going to do without a nose, or ears, or
eyes? I am going to take them all, but will let you live so that
people may laugh at you and say that I, Ajax Trappier, was the one
who plucked you so nicely. When I am through I am going to sing
<i>Alouette</i> over what is left of you!"</p>

<p>This was too much for Gaspard. He shortened the diameter of
their circle a foot, and Ajax promptly shortened it another. The
monk began muttering under his breath&mdash;praying again, Clifton
knew. Then with one impulse the two fighters came together in a
terrific head-on collision, and at the same time grunts and roars
rose from both of them. So far as Clifton could see, no effort was
made to strike a blow with the fists. But the feet of the fighters
became active, and he understood why they had kept on their shoes.
In the first twenty seconds one of Trappier's shiny enamels caught
Gaspard in the pit of the stomach and drew out of him a roar that
could have been heard at the back end of the farm. At the sound of
that roar, Adrien Clamart, who was hidden in the second barn,
thrust his head out through the opening he had made by loosening a
board and did not pull it in again until the combat was over.</p>

<p>From then on the action became so swift that Clifton could not
keep track of it. The two giants rolled to earth, arms and legs
interwoven&mdash;doubling, twisting, grunting and choking, now one
on top and then the other, and at times turning over and over like
a pinwheel, as Clifton had liked to roll down-hill when a boy. He
knew that things were happening, desperate things, but only by the
vocal manifestations of the combatants could he keep any record of
them during the first few minutes.</p>

<p>A blood-curdling howl from Gaspard told him when Ajax's teeth
first got into play, and a howl in a slightly different key
likewise assured him when Gaspard put in a good stroke of business.
The plot of green in which the combatants were laboring very
quickly took on the aspect of a place where pigs had been rooting.
Clods of turf flew up. Dust rose. Grass floated away on the air.
Thuds, groans, mutterings, great gasps and occasional bellows came
with these other evidences of ferocity from Gaspard and Ajax. They
began to remind Clifton of those rubber dolls that respond when
pinched and shriek loudly when suddenly bitten by a dog, for
neither of the two was born to suffer in silence, and every hurt,
every momentary advantage, had its immediate announcement in a
properly pitched key of triumph or dismay.</p>

<p>Gaspard made the most noise. There was no doubt of that from the
beginning. And it was not all inspired by triumph. Certain gasps
and grunts were coming out of the very depths of him. Clifton saw
his face, and it had been shoved firmly and deeply into the earth
where there had been no grass to soften the effect. In that moment
Clifton observed that his mouth was open and his eyes were bulging
and he was spitting out soil. Then the gladiators creaked and
twisted and strained, and he was gone out of sight again.</p>

<p>But the haunting things in this epic struggle which was being
fought without a blow between four hundred and fifty pounds of
human flesh and bone were Ajax's teeth. They were constantly bared,
and no movement was so swift that the sunlight did not catch them
in a sudden ivory flashing. The creature, it seemed to Clifton, was
constantly smiling under his fiercely bristling mustache!</p>

<p>Then three things followed in swift succession, each of which
seemed to promise the finish of the struggle. In number one it
appeared definitely settled that Gaspard was receiving his <i>coup
de gr&acirc;ce</i>. Ajax had him face down, with his huge hands at
the back of his neck, and Clifton's blood went cold. A single blow
of Trappier's mighty fist and St. Ives would be done for. But no
true habitant thinks of his fist in a fight. So, following the
usual method of one in his triumphant position, Ajax began the
process of obliterating Gaspard's countenance in the soil. He
rubbed and thumped and scrubbed it ferociously, and as he did this
the little monk began to hop about the two excitedly swinging his
arms in the air and forgetting his prayers to shriek out terrified
advice to his friend. Evidently Gaspard was done for, for even
howls and groans could no longer come from him, so intimately had
his face become a part of the earth.</p>

<p>In this moment of dismay and horror Clifton looked toward the
window. Was it conceivable that Angelique would remain an inactive
witness of this catastrophe to her lover? Disgust and loathing
filled him when he saw her white and frightened face staring
through the flowers!</p>

<p>That instant the unexpected happened. As if in a dying fit
Gaspard performed an extraordinary contortion which brought his two
legs about Ajax's neck, where they fastened themselves like the two
arms of a deadly, choking vise, and seeing them thus Alphonse
emitted a wild and piercing cry of joy. Ajax made an effort to
dislodge the grip with one hand, still keeping the other in
Gaspard's hair. Failing in this he brought up the other, which
movement freed St. Ives so that he could turn his head and suck in
a little fresh air. The legs tightened more, and out of Ajax's
mouth came a yell which ended in a gurgle. But so far as outward
appearance went Ajax was still smiling. It was the effect of the
man's confounded teeth, Clifton thought! He would die smiling. And
when he was dead he would lie smiling in his coffin.</p>

<p>A feeling of intense relief swept over him. This, at last, must
be the end. Ajax was gazing skyward, as if looking at a single
star. His mustache bristled skyward. His eyes began to bulge
skyward. His extraordinary teeth seemed to grow longer, reaching
skyward. Everything was skyward, and it seemed to Clifton that even
his soul was mounting in a debonair kind of way. Never had he felt
such a feeling of admiration for Ajax Trappier as in this moment
when he was helplessly waiting for the last of his wind to give
out. It would be impossible for him to exist more than a minute or
two.</p>

<p>He was thinking this, and preparing himself to pry apart
Gaspard's legs before he murdered Ajax, when a third unexpected
happening followed the first and second.</p>

<p>Ajax had loosened his hands and was reaching out slowly and
somewhat blindly as if groping for something. This, Clifton
thought, was the last act of a man about to give up the ghost, and
he had already taken a step forward to end the affair when Ajax's
two hands fastened themselves about Gaspard's ankle, and he saw
that ankle and the lower leg to which it was attached slowly but
surely bending toward the big, white, grinning teeth. Clifton held
his breath. Could Ajax make it! He did&mdash;and not only made it,
but shoved up Gaspard's pant-leg and pulled down his sock. Then his
magnificent teeth sank in.</p>

<p>In his time Clifton had heard the wild shouting of men&mdash;of
men frenzied by hatred and passion and the desire to kill, but in
all his days no yell had split his ears like that which came from
Gaspard St. Ives. It was more than a yell. It was one long and
continuous roar and had he been blindfolded Clifton would have
doubted that a human throat could have made it. Gaspard's legs
loosened and Ajax's popping eyes began going back into their proper
places in his head. Grimly and steadily he settled down to his
work, putting every ounce of the increasing strength of his jaw
into the labor at hand.</p>

<p>With Gaspard in this grim and tragic situation Clifton could not
remain unconscious to the suffering of Alphonse the monk. The
little man was almost sobbing in his despair, for surely St. Ives
was being hamstrung before his eyes! Ajax was now complete master
of the situation and would probably remain so until the end unless
his teeth gave out, for Gaspard's legs were so twisted that they
had no power with which to escape from the other's grip, and he was
so firmly fixed upon his face, with Ajax on top of him, that his
own hands were helpless. An invisible force seemed to drag Clifton
about to the window, and there he saw Angelique Fanchon, but not a
movement was she making as she listened to Gaspard's wild yells of
pain.</p>

<p>These yells were manifest evidence that for the present Gaspard
had entirely forgotten Angelique. Not so with Ajax. In these
precious moments of his triumph his thoughts went to the window and
the eyes behind it, and there filled him an overwhelming desire to
see Angelique looking out on his victory. So he began to twist
himself a little at a time so that his eyes might come within range
of the coveted spot.</p>

<p>He succeeded, but in the achievement it was necessary for him to
change the angle of Gaspard's off leg, and the error was fatal.
With one mighty effort Gaspard twisted himself half over, freed his
leg, doubled it up, and sent it back with desperate force. The
chance blow caught Ajax somewhere in front and sent him through the
air like a bag of wheat. He struck the earth with a lifeless thud,
and there he lay, stretched out nicely on his back with his arms
and legs out spider-like, his eyes shut, his teeth smiling up at
the sky and his mustache bristling in the sunlight.</p>

<p>For a moment the monk bent over the unconscious Ajax. Then with
mysterious swiftness he departed for the front gate, and half a
minute later was flying down the road behind Trappier's black
horse.</p>

<p>Was it possible that Ajax was dead? Clifton bent over him
fearfully. He was breathing, sucking in air mournfully, and his
teeth clicked with each count. Then Gaspard limped painfully to his
victim and triumphantly faced the window. Clifton was attending
once more to Ajax when a different kind of cry came from St. Ives.
Looking over his shoulder he saw the man rushing like mad for the
kitchen door.</p>

<p>Quickly he followed. Possibly the pain he had suffered had
turned Gaspard's head. Only a step behind him Clifton entered the
room with the flower-filled window, and in this room, securely
trussed up with rope in a chair and placed so that she could not
help seeing the inspiring duel on the green outside, was a young
woman. She had turned herself so that her horrified eyes
encountered their own as they entered. She was deadly white, and
sniffling. Her hair was sleek and straight. Her plumpness
overflowed the chair. If this was the beauteous Angelique...</p>

<p>Gaspard gave a great gasp that filled the room. Slowly he
circled about the girl. He tried to speak, and choked. Through the
layer of soil which Ajax had scoured into his face his eyes bulged
in amazement and shock. Finally words came from him&mdash;faint,
weak, gasping, like a dying man's.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it&mdash;isn't&mdash;Angelique&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl's tongue came to life. Moaning and weeping and swaying
herself until she threatened to overturn the chair she entered into
a mild delirium of pleading and passionate explanation, out of
which stood the main fact that the stranger monk had threatened her
soul with eternal perdition unless she played the part before the
window which he had demanded of her; and to make doubly sure he had
tied her there with a rope. She wasn't Angelique Fanchon, and
didn't know anybody was going to take her for Mademoiselle
Angelique. She was only the cook, and the stranger monk had told
her there was going to be a cock-fight in the yard, and he wanted
her as a witness if anything unfair should happen. And he had
threatened her with a thousand devils if she failed him!</p>

<p>In her excitement Clifton saw a letter fall from her lap to the
floor. He picked it up and handed it to St. Ives.</p>

<p>"There is the letter Anne Gervais sent you. Alphonse must have
taken it from my pocket. Read it!"</p>

<p>He felt an odd kind of thrill creeping over him as he cut the
girl's bonds. Gaspard's big fingers worked clumsily as he opened
the envelope. Stupidly he began looking at the writing, with
Clifton watching him again after the girl had run out of the room
like a scared rabbit. They could hear her continued blubbering as
the kitchen door slammed, at least Clifton could. But St. Ives had
suffered some kind of shock. He continued to stare at the
school-teacher's writing; and then, without warning, he dashed from
the room, limping as he ran.</p>

<p>Clifton followed, and found the girl on the kitchen floor,
rocking herself back and forth in a hysterical spasm. For a few
moments he paused to comfort her. When he got outside he saw Ajax
sitting up and Gaspard vigorously shaking one of his limp hands.
Then St. Ives hurried limpingly toward the barn, and Ajax remained
in his unstable sitting posture, his head wobbling, his white teeth
smiling, every hair in his mustache bristling and his eyes slowly
assuming a light of intelligence and understanding. Clifton shook
the hand which Gaspard had dropped and it seemed to him that Ajax's
vacant smile widened a little.</p>

<p>Not until he was making a dive for the back door of the barn
with his garments under his arm did St. Ives appear to think of
Clifton. He paused then and held back the letter. Through its
coating of soil his face blazed with a great light.</p>

<p>"Read that!" he cried. "I'm going down to the creek and take a
bath!"</p>

<p>Outside the barn door Clifton read the few lines which Anne
Gervais had written:</p>

<p>My own Gaspard [she began]: Antoinette almost made me promise
not to let you know I am here, but I cannot help it. She thinks it
will disturb your work with her if I tell you now that I am sorry,
and that I love you so much more than I ever have, and that I have
made up my mind to do as you wish, and be with you, and work with
you, and care for you from this moment until I die. Monsieur Brant
will tell you what I am doing here. He is so nice, and I am sorry
Antoinette has such a feeling against him. Truly, Gaspard, I think
she is shamming, and that she loves him.</p>

<p>And then came a signature which made Clifton's heart jump.</p>

<p>This Anne Gervais up at Mistassini was not Anne Gervais! <i>She
was Angelique Fanchon!</i></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p>Clifton did not hurry after he had read Anne's letter. Like
Gaspard he read it a second and a third time and by the end of the
third perusal the surprising effect of the discovery that Anne
Gervais was Angelique Fanchon had given way to a warm and thrilling
sensation produced by the last line and a half she had written.</p>

<p>He followed in the direction Gaspard had taken, with the letter
in his hand. When he came to a point where he could see St. Ives at
his bath he waited until the other had dried himself and was
dressed. Gaspard's slowness rather surprised him. He seemed in no
great haste, and when he had finished he stood looking down at the
pool until Clifton came up. His face was very red and bruised in
places, and it wore a look which was almost a betrayal of
embarrassment, with a whimsically humorous light behind it. He did
not speak at once but took the letter again, with fingers that were
clumsily gentle, and for a time his eyes seemed to linger on each
word.</p>

<p>"I am not worth that," he said then, without looking up. "I
think I have been a little mad. But reason has returned to me. A
little while ago I was filled with the desire to destroy Ajax
before Angelique's eyes. Now I am praying God that neither she nor
my sister will ever hear of this fool thing I have done. Will you
help me keep it from them?"</p>

<p>"If it is possible, yes. But there are others to
remember&mdash;Ajax, the girl in the window, Adrien and
Alphonse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am going back," interrupted St. Ives. "I am bound to tell
Ajax I am sorry. He is a big-hearted fellow after all, and when I
speak truth about him, and along with that he won't want the story
of the affair to get out. Between us we will fix it up with the
girl and Adrien, and I have thought we might loose a few pigs from
the field to explain the uprooting of the yard. If you can find
Alphonse, and keep his tongue quiet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He ran away with Trappier's horse&mdash;to escape your wrath
for the trick he played on you, I think," said Clifton. "Who is
that coming into the edge of the field over there?"</p>

<p>"It is Ajax!" exclaimed St. Ives. "I will go and meet him.
Good-by, my dear friend. You know what is in my heart, so tell as
much of it as you can to Angelique&mdash;and that I shall come to
her the happiest man in the world the instant my sister's work and
mine is finished. I would go now, but I knew she would not like
that. And if you can get hold of Alphonse, who probably fears death
at my hands, and is already on his way to the woods&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are sure that you and Ajax will not become engaged in
another fight?" interrupted Clifton doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Possibly I should go back with you."</p>

<p>Gaspard laughed, and shook his head. "It would humiliate me
greatly to have you hear the apologies I am going to offer Ajax."
For a moment they stood with hands clasped. "You have&mdash;some
word for my sister, Clifton?</p>

<p>"The best of good wishes."</p>

<p>He watched St. Ives as he returned limpingly across the great
field. Ajax came more slowly, and at last stopped&mdash;probably
anticipating further hostilities, Clifton thought. He could see
Gaspard waving his hand in a friendly fashion, and after that they
came together. For several minutes they stood without movement, and
at the end of that time turned about and walked side by side toward
the Fanchon barns. Twice Gaspard waved to Clifton. A third time and
Ajax waved a hand. Clifton smiled. The dove of peace had strangely
spread its wings.</p>

<p>Alone he returned into the woods, found the buggy, and came out
upon the winding highway, thankful that he was started upon his
lonely journey back to the Mistassini forests&mdash;and Anne
Gervais. He felt a new sense of restfulness&mdash;was glad to get
away from St. Ives, glad the monk had disappeared. He wanted a
little time alone with thoughts which seemed out of place in their
company. Here, with a sleepy wood on each side of him, the soft
dust of an almost untraveled road underfoot, and his horse falling
into his humor by plodding along at a slow walk, he felt privileged
again&mdash;privileged to dream, to hope, to build his castles high
up once more, as he built them not so long ago.</p>

<p>It was Anne Gervais who helped him. The spirit of her seemed
near him, whispering softly in words what she had written in her
letter&mdash;that it all was possible, that in Antoinette's heart
<i>might</i> be something for him that was not hatred, something
that was&mdash;love. He allowed the thought and even the word
itself to possess him, and in the same breath he repeated to
himself the impossibility of it&mdash;yet that impossibility did
not keep his heart from trembling. And with the thrill of this
nearness of hope it occurred to him that on the beach the night of
the big storm Alphonse the monk had told him this same thing even
more clearly than had Anne.</p>

<p>After a little he tried not to think of it any more. It was
folly&mdash;a folly which would leave an abiding bitterness behind.
Antoinette despised him. He knew, while the others could only
guess. Yet he could not get rid of Anne and her faith. They rode
with him in the buggy. They sang with the birds along the way. They
were a part of the flowers he passed. They gave a softness to the
sunshine, a greater beauty to the sky. He found himself humming a
tune, and talking aloud to the horse. That was his old self. And a
part of the emptiness and loneliness which he had felt for many
days was gone.</p>

<p>He wondered why Anne had come into the woods as Anne Gervais and
not as Angelique Fanchon. Of course there was some reason for her
masquerading under another person's name. Antoinette was mixed up
in it, too&mdash;and the monk undoubtedly. He seemed to be the
inspiring angel, or devil, wherever things were happening. Why had
he played all this apparent trickery on St. Ives? Why had he
plotted and encouraged the fight when he knew Angelique Fanchon was
on the Mistassini? One question added itself to another until
Clifton gave up trying to answer them.</p>

<p>He had almost come to the turning of the back road onto the main
highway when a figure darted out from a cover of underbrush ahead
of him.</p>

<p>It was Alphonse!</p>

<p>He was dusty and covered with perspiration, and he nervously
looked up and down the road as Clifton reined in his horse. Then he
smiled. Clifton did not return his greeting. Suspicion of the monk
and the unpleasant effect of his sudden appearance at the roadside
were revealed clearly in his face and attitude. He made no attempt
to hide them. But Alphonse passed them over with a mirthless cackle
as he climbed into the buggy.</p>

<p>As he drove on Clifton became oppressed by a strange sensation.
Something about the monk began to stir him deeply. The little man
looked straight ahead and his hands twisted nervously on his knees.
He seemed to be trembling, too, and looking down at him Clifton saw
his lips moving silently; age had settled more than ever in his
face, leaving it pinched and thin and sickly white. What Clifton
saw was more like sickness than fear.</p>

<p>Until they came to the turning of the road into the main highway
silence rode with them in the buggy. Clifton's tongue clove to the
roof of his mouth as he thought of madness and fancied that he saw
it in the other's face. Then Alphonse seemed to come out of himself
with a struggle, and looked up at him, and laughed. But there was
no lightness in the laugh.</p>

<p>"Where is your friend Gaspard?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Making apologies to Ajax Trappier," answered Clifton. "They had
a love-feast after you ran away&mdash;and both are anxious that no
rumor of this foolishness reaches the ears of Mesdemoiselles St.
Ives and Fanchon. I accepted the obligation of guaranteeing the
secrecy of your own tongue. Was I right?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," nodded Alphonse. "I have no reason for telling
Angelique, and I never expect to see Antoinette again."</p>

<p>Coldly and clearly spoken, the words were a shock to
Clifton.</p>

<p>"I think my work is coming to an end," the monk went on in a
strangely even voice. "And you are the one man in the world who
should know a little something about it, Monsieur Clifton, because
there is between us a bond which even my ugliness and what you
think is half madness cannot break&mdash;our love for Antoinette.
Mine will die with me. Yours will go on living. But I am not mad,
as you think, and as Gaspard sometimes thinks. There are times when
I can see too far, too clearly, too deeply into matters which
others cannot see.</p>

<p>"That is why I brought this fight about, and made the girl take
Angelique's place in the window. I knew that until the feud between
Gaspard and Ajax had burned itself out there would be no peace in
Gaspard's mind, and one thing alone would destroy their enmity and
make friends of the two&mdash;a spectacle which, when over, would
prove them ridiculous in their own eyes.</p>

<p>"So when Antoinette suggested schools in the woods I secretly
plotted with her to make Angelique one of the teachers.
Mademoiselle Fanchon did not guess my part in the scheme, and so
she almost betrayed herself when we met on the Mistassini, for she
had come up there under the name of Anne Gervais for&mdash;I don't
know what reason. That is her secret and Mademoiselle Antoinette's.
Anne Gervais is a pretty name, but Anne Gervais herself is a skinny
old maid of Quebec who has pestered the life out of Gaspard with
her adoration. No matter what Angelique's reason for taking
another's name may have been, it has helped me. There is one more
task ahead of me, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" asked Clifford, as the other hesitated.</p>

<p>"My work will be done. Those I love more than my own life will
then understand. And Antoinette&mdash;may God forever bless
her!&mdash;will be happy. And you, Monsieur&mdash;I am telling you
this so that some day you may also tell it to them, when otherwise
they might despise me. Oh, I am not mad! I am terribly sane! Too
sane! For madness of a kind is often better than sanity. And when
it is over&mdash;when my work is finished&mdash;I want enough of
the truth to be known so that you, and those two I love, may
sometimes be kind enough to pray for the salvation of a soul that
once inspired a man of God and which now struggles weakly in the
body of a sinner. Monsieur&mdash;there is a spring of cold water in
the corner of this wood. Are you thirsty?"</p>

<p>"No, but I will wait for you," said Clifton, stopping in a patch
of shade.</p>

<p>For a moment he was laboring against an almost irresistible
impulse. It was not common for him to feel affectionately inclined
toward men, so that he desired to put his hand on them. Benedict
was the big exception. But in this moment of strange emotion that
passed over him it was only a little thing that restrained him from
placing an arm about the monk's shoulders, as he would have done in
comforting Joe. And before that instant of self-repression was gone
the little monk stood in the road. He looked up and tried to smile.
Then Clifton watched the dusty and broken figure as it passed
through the roadside thicket and over the fence into the wood, and
his heart was filled suddenly with compassion and sympathy.</p>

<p>He waited. Where the monk had disappeared a brown-coated warbler
sang, as if welcoming a creature as drab and aloof from the world
as itself. A squirrel ran along the rail fence. From the edge of
the wood came the soft droning of bees, the rasping music of a
locust, and the calls and whisperings and almost unheard murmuring
of life deeper in. As far under the roofs of the trees as he could
see Clifton caught the mellow gleaming of golden pools and streams
of sunshine on the cool earth.</p>

<p>In among these the monk had gone, and he did not come out
again.</p>

<p>Clifton listened for his footsteps and the sound of disturbed
brush. On an old stub a woodpecker hammered. Closer about him crept
the <i>cheep, cheep, cheep</i> and <i>twit, twit, twit</i> of
little brown brush-birds. The squirrel scolded impudently from the
fence, and down the road a fat woodchuck waddled across on his
daily adventures into a clover patch.</p>

<p>It was taking the monk a long time, Clifton thought.</p>

<p>He got out and fastened the horse to a poplar sapling. Then he
climbed the fence and came upon a tiny trickle of water which he
trailed back for a hundred steps or so until he found its
birthplace&mdash;the spring.</p>

<p>The monk was not there, and he had not been there, for no trace
of footsteps was left in the soft mold about it. Clifton called his
name and his only answer was a mysterious hushing of the wood about
him.</p>

<p>He stood silent as the truth grew upon him. The monk had not
come for a drink. He was gone, and had no intention of
returning.</p>

<p>Yet Clifton waited for half an hour at the spring, looking
through the lonely hush of the trees to catch any flash of movement
which the yellow pools and streams of sun-glow might reveal.</p>

<p>After that he returned to the buggy and drove eastward on the
dirt highway that led to Saint Methode. From the cool stillness of
the byway he found himself suddenly in a moving stream of life and
light and laughter. The habitants were returning from church. The
younger swains and country gallants passed him first, each vying
with the others in showing off the virtues of his horsemanship and
steed&mdash;when the gallants rode alone. But when beside one sat a
clear-eyed, pink-cheeked daughter of the land the young Saint
Johnite wooer held his seat with stiff and dignified solemnity,
knowing that the eyes of the young lady's elders were on them from
behind.</p>

<p>And Clifton walked, letting them all pass him&mdash;long-legged
Arab and lightning-swift galloway, fillies as spirited as young
girls, thoroughbreds as sleek as silk and geldings born for the
fields, all bearing their happy burdens of love and cheer and faith
in God that helped to make the glory of the day. The swiftest gone,
the others followed&mdash;carts and blackboards crowded with
children, sometimes two and three vehicles to a family;
sweethearts, little loath to let the miles drag slowly within the
vision of watchful mothers and fathers behind, and last of all half
a dozen dog-carts whose juvenile drivers taunted Clifton
good-naturedly for his slowness as they passed him.</p>

<p>Yet with all this there seemed something missing for Clifton,
and slowly he continued his way until the gray trail of dust had
completely settled ahead of him. Even after that he did not hurry.
He could not get the monk out of his mind, or the strangeness of
his departure, and behind the gaiety and happiness of the country
folk who had passed him there remained a cloud which gathered
itself more about him as the day lengthened. It was after midnight
when he reached the Mistassini.</p>

<p>When he went to breakfast in the morning he had slept only three
or four hours, and he did not leave his room until he saw Angelique
and Catherine come from the door of their cabin, booted and dressed
in riding-breeches and khaki shirts, each with a diminutive
packsack over her shoulder. As he hurried to meet them his heart
warmed at their sportsmanship. They were prepared for roughing it.
Even their boots were made for the stress of water and mud and
rock.</p>

<p>Clifton noticed this, and the other things, but more than all
else Angelique's face and eyes filled his vision. Her greeting,
though she tried to make it as gay as Catherine Clamart's, was
subdued by what he saw there. She wanted to know about St. Ives;
how her message had been received, and what word he had sent to her
in return.</p>

<p>When breakfast was finished Clifton asked her for a few minutes
alone.</p>

<p>They walked toward the river, leaving Catherine with the young
engineer who had horses waiting, and who was to guide them on their
first journey among the camps and jobbers.</p>

<p>"We had planned to start an hour earlier," said Angelique to
Clifton, "but Catherine could never quite finish fussing with that
hair of hers. It's glorious, and I don't blame her. She is
desperately in love, and so is young Vincent, and each is trying to
hide it from the other until a decently proper time has passed.
Yesterday he blundered on us when we were sunning our hair where we
thought no one would see us down among the rocks, and it was funny
to see the look of incredulity and abject adoration in his face. It
was all for Catherine. She was a veritable golden goddess aflame
with a smother of tresses almost to her knees. If I hadn't been
there I think Vincent would have fallen on his knees. Isn't it
silly for a man to feel like that?" And she shot a quick look up at
him, as if daring him to answer in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Maybe it is," he said, appearing not to notice her challenge,
"but, somehow, it happens just the same. Men will persist in making
fools of themselves, if not in one way then in another. There is
Gaspard St. Ives, for instance. The first day I met him he raved to
me about the beauty of some little country girl&mdash;Angelique
Fanchon, I think her name was&mdash;and when I smiled at his
enthusiasm he wanted to fight me. But I never heard him breathe a
word about a girl named Anne Gervais!"</p>

<p>"I have been foolish," murmured Angelique.</p>

<p>"Very," agreed Clifton.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;gave Gaspard the note?"</p>

<p>"When I told him I had a letter from Anne Gervais he refused to
accept it."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"But I forced it on him, and he read it."</p>

<p>Angelique gave a deep sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;are you playing with me, Monsieur Brant? If you
are&mdash;if you think it is so very amusing to keep me in
suspense&mdash;" A little dark flash of lightning passed up to him
from her eyes.</p>

<p>"Play with you?" Clifton laughed softly. "Only because I am
happy in your happiness, little friend! I don't think I ever knew
St. Ives until he read that letter. It was like a flame that showed
me the true depths of him for the first time. I believe he had
grown a little hopeless, and your letter lifted him shoulder-high
with the gods. He said very little, but it was the way he said it
that counted. He gave me this message: 'Tell her that I shall come
to her the happiest man in the world the instant my sister's work
and mine is finished. I would go now, but I know she would not like
that.' And&mdash;he let me read the letter!"</p>

<p>He could feel the tremble of Angelique's hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"He let me read the letter," he repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand," replied Angelique, and her head was bowed
so that he could not see her face, and her voice was almost a
whisper.</p>

<p>"In it you spoke of me," he went on. "I am grateful for your
good opinion of me. And if it is true that you think Mademoiselle
Antoinette has not this feeling against me&mdash;well, if you tell
me that, I think I shall be almost as happy as Gaspard St. Ives.
But if you wrote the lines thoughtlessly&mdash;"</p>

<p>He looked down to meet Angelique's eyes, beautifully soft and
glowing.</p>

<p>"They were true," she said, and it seemed to him that her words
were three little electric dynamos that set to work in his heart
and body and blood. "I am more certain of it now than when I wrote
them. You have done something terrible, Clifton, and Antoinette is
trying to punish you, as I tried to punish Gaspard, and it is
hurting her as much as it is hurting you. If that were not true,
why should she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please go on," entreated Clifton, as she hesitated.</p>

<p>"Why should her eyes be red at times from weeping?" asked
Angelique. "My own were that way many times during the past half
year because I loved Gaspard and still tried to make him believe I
hated him."</p>

<p>"It may be she weeps because of the strain and torment the
machinations of Ivan Hurd have placed her under," suggested
Clifton, his voice beating in his own ears.</p>

<p>"No, there is a flash in her eyes when she thinks of Ivan Hurd,
or speaks of his work. She cries&mdash;at night."</p>

<p>"You know?"</p>

<p>"Twice, when I slept with her."</p>

<p>"It must be for other cause than me."</p>

<p>"But I have overheard her talk to little Joe about you. She
tells me she dislikes you, repeats it too often for truth,
Clifton&mdash;and in secret she tells Joe you are the finest man in
the world and that he must grow up to be very much as you are. Once
I heard those very words, and I did eavesdrop, I confess, when I
heard her speaking them."</p>

<p>"It is because she is too finely honorable to prejudice Joe
against me."</p>

<p>"And I have happened to look into a little box, in which I was
hunting for powder for my nose," continued Angelique, "and in this
box was a letter and a telegram, and on one I saw your
name&mdash;and got out of the box as quickly as I could! In just
that way I kept Gaspard's letters, not because I hated him but
because I loved him."</p>

<p>Clifton drew in a breath that almost choked him.</p>

<p>"If only half of what you set me hoping for could come true!" he
said.</p>

<p>"Was it so very terrible, that wrong which you must have done
her?" asked Angelique Fanchon softly.</p>

<p>"I told her I loved her."</p>

<p>"Not a very great sin."</p>

<p>"But I happened to say what was in my heart the first time I saw
her&mdash;the first night, in her home."</p>

<p>"Ugh-h-h!" shivered Angelique.</p>

<p>"And I told her so each day thereafter; and the third night,
during a storm on Lake Saint John of which she has probably had
something to say to you, I carried her in my arms to a habitant's
home and kissed her considerably on the way."</p>

<p>"And she let you do that?"</p>

<p>"She thought I was her brother."</p>

<p>Angelique feigned a little scream.</p>

<p>"That was terrible," she cried. "But if Gaspard had done that
with me I don't think I should have tried to hate him so much.
Unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"He blundered inexcusably afterward. For instance, are you
certain Antoinette really believed you were Gaspard? Isn't it just
possible she knew it was <i>you</i>, and that the experience gave
her happiness instead of torment until you were silly enough to
reveal your identity to her in the light of the habitant's home?
Oh, yes, she told me about the storm, and your carrying her, but
she didn't say anything about the kisses, of course. And when you
stood there like a dunce, and left her not a shred of pride to hide
herself under, was there anything she could do but make up her mind
to hate you? Of course, there wasn't! I tried to hate Gaspard for
six months for less than that!"</p>

<p>"I thought it was the honest thing to do."</p>

<p>"And it was the very silliest thing to do. If she was shamming a
little, and you spoiled it for her, your crime was
inexcusable&mdash;and I doubt if she will come into your arms again
too easily. But she loves you. I am quite sure of that. There come
Catherine and Vincent! Observe how he drops a step or two behind
her as she picks her way among the rocks, just so that he may drink
his eyes full of that wondrous braid of hair! Oh, we all have our
pretty little trickeries, Clifton, and it is sinful to discover
them!"</p>

<p>"I shall always think of you as the good angel in my life," said
Clifton gratefully. "I think you have made me happy. And always,
when you seem nearest and dearest to me, I must think of you as
Anne&mdash;Anne Gervais."</p>

<p>"Only another little hypocrisy," breathed Angelique, as the
other two came nearer. "We are full of it, Clifton, so full of it
that it is a wonder we do not sometimes wreck the world. I ask your
forgiveness. The real Anne Gervais was coming up, until the last
moment, when the poor, dear thing met a widower who needed
mothering and married him on short notice. That will please
Gaspard. So when I filled her place, and asked Catherine to come
with me, I also took her name. It was a whim. A little fun. And it
may be that Angelique Fanchon thought it might be a bit
embarrassing to meet Clifton Brant, under the circumstances. But we
got over it quickly, didn't we?"</p>

<p>She was smiling at Catherine and Vincent as she spoke the last
words, but the tips of her fingers pressed Clifton's arm.</p>

<p>"Antoinette will join us within ten days or two weeks," she
finished. "Then, if your eyes are sharp and your judgment is
good&mdash;you will see!"</p>

<p>Half an hour later he watched them ride away, Vincent between
the two, and until they disappeared entirely in the thickening
forest he could see the flash of sunshine in Catherine's golden
hair.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p>Clifton resumed his work with an enthusiasm which had not
possessed him for years. Angelique Fanchon had swept away the cloud
that had oppressed him so grimly, and he was inspired now by a
glorious desire to achieve and succeed where only duty and a somber
determination had spurred him on before. Antoinette did not hate
him. She did not even dislike him, but kept what he had written
her, and talked nicely to Joe about him, and&mdash;if Angelique
Fanchon was right at all&mdash;cared a little for him! His mind was
filled with dreams and inspiring visions, and he felt equal to a
dozen Ivan Hurds&mdash;to a hundred.</p>

<p>He plunged into his work with a kind of ferocity which reminded
him of certain fighting days in Belgium. The third day after his
return from Saint F&eacute;licien the boat from Roberval brought
Colonel Denis. His confidence then was like a mass of rock which
dynamite could not blow up. They went from camp to camp together,
and not an hour passed that Clifton did not point out some fresh
reason why they would beat Hurd. Denis threw off ten years from his
shoulders during the five days in the forests. Two of these days
Angelique Fanchon and Catherine Clamart were in their company, and
the souls of the girls had risen to the fight like Clifton's.</p>

<p>One of the schools was well under construction and the others
were plotted and logs were being cut. The girls were already
building their programs and arranging classes, and to the amazement
of Clifton and John Denis they had brought a thrill of anticipation
and excitement into every camp and jobber's home by arranging
classes for the teaching of English to the men and women. There was
not an adult in the woods who did not realize the value of an
understanding of this language, no matter how small it might be, in
adding to his or her earning capacity with the big English
companies that ran ninety percent of the mills and timber
concessions of the province.</p>

<p>"We cannot lose when we have a spirit like this behind us,"
Clifton said for the twentieth time to Colonel Denis. "If we get
the timber cut nothing that Hurd can do will keep it from going
down to the mills. Your big work now is to encourage the right side
of the Government to come up here on an investigating junket or two
when we are ready. The work we are doing will please the Premier.
He is a constructionist and despises Hurd.</p>

<p>"Get his crowd up here, let them hear our school bells and see
what our people are doing and Hurd won't dare to loose his
foreigners on the criminal stuff he has planned. Arrange for the
newspapers to have men with them. We've got a tremendous break
ahead of us, and if we fail there are no such principles as honor
and honesty on the face of the earth!"</p>

<p>He was like a tremendously charged dynamo in his enthusiasm, and
only Angelique Fanchon knew the inspiring flame that was at the
bottom of it.</p>

<p>"I'm going to cut two million logs," he said to Denis, "<i>and
I'm going to get them down!</i>"</p>

<p>The day after John Denis returned to Quebec he saw Angelique
Fanchon again.</p>

<p>"Since the Archbishop has prohibited dancing among Catholics in
the Province of Quebec we have decided to give a weekly musical
entertainment and play at each of the schools," she announced. "We
will need four pianos."</p>

<p>Clifton sent out an order for them that same day.</p>

<p>From then until the middle of September Clifton had no word from
Antoinette or Gaspard St. Ives either directly or through
Angelique. But the people continued to come in. By the fifteenth a
hundred and eighty men were in the woods, and with them forty women
and sixty children. On the seventeenth the first school bell ever
heard in this northern wilderness sent its silvery chimes through
the forest.</p>

<p>On the eighteenth came a cold and brief announcement to Clifton
from Antoinette St. Ives saying that she and her brother would
arrive at Mistassini on the twentieth.</p>

<p>This was the day that Delphis Bolduc came in with fresh
information regarding Hurd's activities. Hurd had already begun
cutting all along the streams below the Laurentian Company's
timber. His object in forcing the work so early and waiting for the
drive was quite clear. Among other things he was determined to have
ready and waiting for the drive every log the Mistassini could hold
when the spring floods came, and as these logs would all be below
the Laurentian cut there was a great danger of the latter being
crowded out entirely. That, of course, was Hurd's plot. If he could
use all of the Mistassini's available raftage water for his own
timber and thus hold back the Laurentian logs until the high water
had passed the ruin of the latter company would be complete.</p>

<p>But Delphis did not bring down gloom with him. He had been
thinking in the woods, he said, and there was a way to beat Hurd at
that game. Forty miles up the river from their last timber
operations, and hidden completely back in a pocket of mountains,
was a big lake which he knew well. Its outleading into the
Mistassini was a stream between mountain walls of rock. It could be
easily dammed and the water in the lake raised forty feet, he
thought.</p>

<p>Of course it would be necessary to do the work secretly or Hurd
would checkmate it. But granting this could be accomplished the
Laurentian people could get their logs into the Mistassini ahead of
Hurd, then blow up the dam with dynamite, and before Hurd knew what
was happening the sudden rush of water would carry their logs well
down the river, below Hurd, where they would have all the advantage
of the spring floods when they came.</p>

<p>The idea was staggering in its immensity. If Bolduc's scheme
could be worked Hurd would not only be beaten but a half of his
season's cut could be left high and dry after the floods had
passed, if Denis was correct in his statement that the Mistassini
would carry five million logs, and no more during the high-water
driving season.</p>

<p>In the company of Vincent, the young chief of his engineering
staff, and with Bolduc guiding them, Clifton left the upper
Mistassini on the same day that Delphis arrived from the Hurd
Concessions. He left a brief letter for Antoinette explaining the
importance of his mission and apologizing for not remaining.</p>

<p>At the first depot up the river he had a few minutes with
Mademoiselle Fanchon.</p>

<p>"Of course you will be there to welcome them," he said.</p>

<p>"Of course I shall not!" declared Angelique warmly. "Do you
suppose I am going to run after Gaspard St. Ives? He must come to
me, wherever I am!"</p>

<p>"But Antoinette?" protested Clifton. "Someone should be
there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And he is running away!" taunted Angelique, raising her long
lashes so that she was looking straight in his eyes.</p>

<p>"It is necessary that I go north."</p>

<p>"Yet not so necessary that you could not wait another thirty
days!"</p>

<p>Clifton flushed.</p>

<p>"You are afraid!"</p>

<p>"I confess it&mdash;a little, yes. I rather seized this
opportunity of getting away. That will permit her to become
acquainted with the work through others, and not myself. I don't
want to force myself on her any more. Frankly, where I used to be
so bold&mdash;I am now&mdash;a coward."</p>

<p>Angelique gave a delightful little laugh, and the flush in her
cheeks and the glow in her eyes were inspiring to look at.</p>

<p>"You are using good judgment now, Monsieur Clifton," she
approved. "Unless a woman believes herself to be vital enough to
frighten the man she loves she does not want him. Of course she
will not know you are running away, unless I tell her. But before
that, if I reveal the truth at all, I shall build you up so
magnificently in her eyes that she may feel a little afraid of
herself. Possibly it is well for her to see what you have done and
hear what Catherine and I think of you before she sees you. So
please hurry away on your important business and don't come back
for a few days!"</p>

<p>So Clifton continued north, happier than when he had
started.</p>

<p>What he found increased the new thrill that life was holding for
him. Delphis Bolduc was right. Vincent's voice had a trembling note
of triumph in it when he explained how easily the lake could be
turned into a mighty reservoir. The dam could be chiefly built of
timber and rock, with just enough steel and cement to reinforce it
in places and plug up the leakages. Three or four charges of
dynamite would utterly demolish it when the proper hour came, and
something like five million cubic feet of water would be turned
into the Mistassini, if the surface of the lake was raised twenty
feet.</p>

<p>The outlet between the rock walls was a little less than sixty
feet. Vincent figured and drew plans in the sand. He would
undertake to do the work in ten days with twenty men, but inasmuch
as secrecy was absolutely vital to their success he recommended six
men, carefully chosen, and a month for the work. Before the day was
over he had eliminated steel and cement almost entirely from his
plans.</p>

<p>"Work should begin immediately," he said, after they had paddled
around the lake, investigating each trickle of water that ran into
it. "There will be no more rains, and very little water finds its
way into the lake during the wintry months. Under normal conditions
the lake will fall another foot between now and January. Our
storage will accumulate very slowly, and it is important not to
lose time." Aside to Clifton, he said a bit whimsically, "Of course
you understand it's going to be a lonesome job up here."</p>

<p>Clifton thought of Catherine, and placed a hand affectionately
on Vincent's arm.</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;but with a golden inspiration behind it," he
consoled.</p>

<p>They set out on their return the next day.</p>

<p>This was Thursday, and Antoinette had arrived at Depot Number
One on Wednesday. Gaspard, of course, had hunted up Angelique
immediately, and this day would undoubtedly be one of excitement
and prodigious happiness on the lower river. His own heart tuned
itself to the pleasant happenings he was imagining. He did not
hurry, but made an excuse of studying the shores of the river as
they passed. Frequently he landed with Vincent and Bolduc to make a
closer inspection, and every moment he was thinking of
Antoinette.</p>

<p>That night he lay awake for hours. His blood was restless. His
mind refused to rest from its incessant building of possibilities,
and these pictures that he conceived were not disturbing, but built
up his optimism until hope became an actual happiness.</p>

<p>It was supper time of the second day when they arrived at the
lower depot. Clifton was grateful for the hour. It would give him
time to clean up and dress, and get over a bit of nervousness that
had begun to possess him. With Vincent he climbed a narrow path
from the river, coming to his own door in an inconspicuous way.</p>

<p>Vincent's eyes had gone swiftly to the cabin set apart for the
girls, and he gave a sudden exclamation of pleasure.</p>

<p>"There's Catherine!" he cried.</p>

<p>Clifton saw her. On this day when she knew they would return she
was waiting for Vincent&mdash;with her magnificent hair in the
heavy braid.</p>

<p>Vincent was off, forgetful of dirt and unshaven face, and
Clifton heard Catherine's glad voice in greeting as he entered his
room. Each minute after that he expected Gaspard to arrive. But
Gaspard did not come. No one came. He had bathed and shaved and
almost finished his dressing when Eugene Bolduc knocked.</p>

<p>"Thought I'd give you time to clean up," he explained, as he
came in.</p>

<p>"The St. Iveses are here?" Clifton asked, his heart
pounding.</p>

<p>"They came day before yesterday. And forty men and half as many
women and children have arrived during the last two days," added
Eugene exultantly. "We expect half a hundred more this week."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed Clifton. "And St. Ives? Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Started for Depot Number Three with Mademoiselle Fanchon this
morning."</p>

<p>"Was Mademoiselle here when the St. Iveses arrived?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Clamart, yes; but Mademoiselle Fanchon was at
Number One, and St. Ives went up to bring her down." Eugene's eyes
twinkled and he gave his shoulders a significant shrug. "A pretty
joke she played on him, with that name of Anne Gervais!"</p>

<p>Confound the man, why didn't he mention Antoinette!</p>

<p>Clifton fastened his tie.</p>

<p>"His sister is comfortable? And&mdash;where is she?"</p>

<p>Eugene had looked out the window.</p>

<p>"There she is. Just finished supper. On her way to the
cabin."</p>

<p>Clifton sauntered to the window and looked. He caught a glimpse
of her, the same slim, straight, adorable little figure, the
uptilted chin, the brown hair he worshiped glowing in the last of
the sun.</p>

<p>Something unleashed itself in him then. His heart choked him,
but it had also choked out fear. He sprang to the door, and before
Antoinette had reached her own he was calling to her. She did not
pause or turn until she reached the cabin. Then, casually, she saw
him. His eagerness shone in his face. It glowed in his eyes. It
trembled in his voice when he spoke.</p>

<p>"Only God knows how glad I am that you are here," he cried.
"I've been counting the days and the hours&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he saw there was no change in the beautiful gray eyes that
were looking at him, no flash of joy or sunshine in them, no
softening glow of welcome or gladness. Her hand rested on the latch
of the door. And she had only half turned toward him.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Monsieur Brant," she said in a quiet, calm voice. "I
am sure my arrival can add nothing to the wonderful work you have
been doing."</p>

<p>The latch clicked and the door opened a few inches, and
something snapped in Clifton's heart. He did not try to speak
again. For a moment Antoinette hesitated, and then she added:</p>

<p>"Possibly I may see you tomorrow, Monsieur. But this evening I
am tired. And&mdash;by the way&mdash;I sent Joe up to the school
with Mademoiselle Fanchon. Of course Bim and the gun are with
him."</p>

<p>She did not offer him her hand. No warmth of friendship crept
into the cold evenness of her voice. The door opened wider and she
entered the cabin. Clifton did not wait for it to close. He turned
and stalked back to his room.</p>

<p>His heart was dead, emotionless. His body and brain were numbed.
Something that was deathlike in its icy chill possessed him. After
a time he had the cook prepare him something to eat. He learned
that Vincent had not come to supper and smiled a bit grimly. Golden
Catherine was filling the emptiness in a hungry man's stomach. Love
was a wonderful thing&mdash;when successful!</p>

<p>With a woodsman bound north Clifton set out in a canoe before it
was light the next morning.</p>

<p>The second day after, at Depot Number Three, he found Angelique
Fanchon.</p>

<p>He was glad that Gaspard was out with the depot manager on an
inspection of the first cutting operations. Angelique was busy at
her work in the school when he called her out. She was happy. He
could see that. She had never looked so beautiful. But when she saw
who it was outside the door a look of distress came into her
face.</p>

<p>"There is something&mdash;terrible&mdash;about you," she said,
staring into his hard eyes. "And I know, <i>I know</i>. Oh, it's my
fault, and I've been such a fool."</p>

<p>Her warm little hands were clutching one of his, and their
tenderness softened the hard look that had settled in his face.</p>

<p>"Why your fault, little friend?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because I made such a mess of it, Clifton. I know she wanted to
see you when she came. It was impossible for her to hide it from
me, or keep the disappointment out of her eyes when she learned you
were up north. And that night, the <i>first</i> night, mind you, I
spoiled it all! I was so happy at what I thought I saw that I came
out all at once and told her how you loved her and that every move
in your life was inspired by her.</p>

<p>"That would have been splendid if I had stopped there. But I
didn't. I went on, and told her that I knew&mdash;was <i>absolutely
positive</i>&mdash;that she loved you, and that it was only her
foolish pride that kept her from letting you know. Dear Mother, you
should have seen her then! She was furious, and accused both you
and me of plotting together and betraying confidences&mdash;and she
said she knew you were back of it all and that this was only
another of your hateful and impossible tricks to gain her
favor.</p>

<p>"Oh, she did flagellate you, Clifton, and me, too&mdash;and told
me clearly not to mix myself up in her affairs. And all the time I
knew her heart was almost breaking between that pride of hers and
love for you, and that she was punishing me mostly to keep herself
from crying. She did cry afterward. She said it was because of the
humiliation I had brought on her. But that wasn't the reason. She
cried because her pride is almost broken, and she wants you so
badly."</p>

<p>Clifton was smiling. Angelique had never seen that same kind of
smile on his face before.</p>

<p>"Dear little mother-girl, you have been awfully good to me, and
because of it I shall help Gaspard fight for your happiness to the
end of your days," he said. "But in all this you have thought and
said you are wrong. I have no doubt now. I only stopped on my way
into the woods to see if all was well between you and Gaspard. And
I see that it is. God be praised for that! Gaspard is a prince, and
you are an angel. Just now I don't feel like seeing Joe, so don't
tell him I have been here. The school work is going well?"</p>

<p>"Beautifully," whispered Angelique, and her long lashes were
shining with tears.</p>

<p>"Good-by!"</p>

<p>"Good-by, Clifton!"</p>

<p>As he turned away her dark eyes were filled with the fire of
stars, and she called after him very softly,</p>

<p>"But remember, Clifton, wherever you go&mdash;Antoinette St.
Ives does truly love you!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p>He went farther north&mdash;to the upper cuttings. From then on,
day after day, he made himself a part of the forest work, passing
from camp to camp and from jobber to jobber, locating new arrivals,
urging and inspiring earlier ones to greater endeavor, overseeing
the building of sluices and creek clearways and dams, and by the
tenth of November had three hundred and twenty-five men at work.
During these six weeks he saw Gaspard twice and Angelique Fanchon
only once, and was careful to avoid situations which would bring
him into contact with Antoinette. Until the middle of November it
was not difficult for him to arrange his movements so that this
result was brought about without creating a very great suspicion
that he was purposely avoiding her, for there was work ahead of him
night and day. But the time came when, as Bolduc put it, the whole
Laurentian outfit was working like a well-oiled machine. With
greater surety than ever Clifton wrote Colonel Denis that two
million logs would be along the driveways when high water came.</p>

<p>Vincent finished his dam, and a guard of three trusted men armed
with rifles watched the premises day and night, eight hours at a
stretch. Clifton was sure Hurd had no suspicion of what had been
done.</p>

<p>The Bolducs kept him in intimate touch with Hurd's activities.
The attitude of their enemy puzzled Eugene and Delphis. Hurd did
not seem to be at all disturbed by the Laurentian Company's success
in getting its timber down and cut. Delphis believed that he had
completely changed his plans, and that instead of "roughing it," as
he had first designed, he had something tremendously more effective
up his sleeve, and was waiting with a confidence which puzzled and
alarmed Bolduc. Hurd was constantly in the woods. He had toned down
his men so there had been no trouble at all between his own and the
Laurentian people. And he was piling up pulpwood in enormous
quantities.</p>

<p>Between the fifteenth of November and the first of December Hurd
sprung two amazing coups.</p>

<p>Unannounced he visited two of the four schools during class
hours, accompanied by several professional-looking strangers, and
talked freely with Mesdemoiselles Fanchon and Clamart, assuring
them that if their schools were a success, which he could readily
believe they were, he would institute the same splendid idea in his
own holdings the following year.</p>

<p>His second inexplicable move was expressed in a letter which
went simultaneously to both Clifton and Antoinette St. Ives, and in
which Hurd asked for permission to send a number of children
belonging to his own people to the Laurentian schools. "It would
give the splendid idea an impetus among my own workers," he said;
and then added, "I will gladly pay a part of your school expenses
for this privilege and accommodation."</p>

<p>It was this letter which necessitated a meeting between Colonel
Denis, Antoinette St. Ives and Clifton on the first of
December.</p>

<p>The meeting was in Bolduc's office at Mistassini, at nine
o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Two months and a half had passed since Clifton had seen
Antoinette. Others had noted the change in him during these weeks.
Angelique Fanchon had been a little frightened at it, as if
something in him had killed the intimacy of their friendship. The
three times he had seen Joe he had found it difficult to live up to
the old chumship which had existed between them. He had found
little to laugh at, or about, and had pursued his work with a
grimness whose effect showed itself in his face now. Hard lines had
grown about his mouth. The same lines were about his eyes. There
was hardness in his attitude, in his glance, in the squareness of
his chin. He could not have met Hurd now with a careless smile, and
he found it more and more difficult to remain a part of Gaspard's
light-heartedness and bonhomie.</p>

<p>With this physical change had come another, a dulling of certain
emotions. The thought of meeting Antoinette no longer filled him
with a nervous dread. He expected the meeting would be unpleasant.
He knew it would be, but he also expected that the necessity of the
meeting would be sufficient excuse in Antoinette's eyes for
bringing him into her presence again.</p>

<p>He arrived at Mistassini at eight o'clock and went directly from
his canoe to Bolduc's office, and was there when Colonel Denis and
Antoinette came from a late breakfast at a quarter of nine.</p>

<p>He rose to meet them, and stood like a bronzed Indian when they
entered. He had never looked quite so much like an Indian as now,
with lips unbroken by a smile as he bowed to Antoinette and shook
hands with Denis. He was years older in the face.</p>

<p>As he stood with Colonel Denis a look almost of terror swept
like a hot flame through Antoinette's eyes. It was gone in an
instant. But her fingers were closed tightly, and she was white.
This man she was looking at was not Clifton Brant! This was not the
man who had fathered Joe and Bim, who had fought for her brother,
who had loved the whole world&mdash;and who had outraged her so
unforgivably! He was a savage. Even his greeting to Colonel Denis
was coldly unemotional. She noticed his clothing, weather-stained,
torn in two or three places, his hands calloused and hard, and his
hair a bit ragged, and she turned to the window a moment to hide a
sudden twitching of her lips and keep from the hard eyes of the man
who had once loved her a betrayal of her own emotion.</p>

<p>Clifton did not guess the correct significance of her action,
and brought the business quickly to a head. He was in a desperate
hurry, he said, and wanted to get back to Depot Number Two as soon
as possible. Bluntly he told what he believed Hurd's motives were,
and sharply disagreed with both Antoinette St. Ives and Colonel
Denis in their opinion that Hurd had at last come to a point where
he had accepted decency as the better part of valor.</p>

<p>"To me your changed opinion of Hurd is as amusing as anything
can be up here," he said to Antoinette. "With spring a tragedy of
some kind will come, and I shall go on preparing for it. No one can
tell who will be sacrificed, but I trust it will not be you,
Mademoiselle."</p>

<p>Even Denis saw the little beating in Antoinette's soft
throat.</p>

<p>"And besides," added Clifton, "you must both understand that I
have my own case against Hurd. He is threatening you in a way,
Mademoiselle, and he is threatening you in another, Colonel
Denis&mdash;but&mdash;he killed my father. You may accept peace if
it is offered you, but I have come to the conclusion that I must go
through with what I came from China to achieve. Hurd may flatter
and blind you two. But he owes me a debt which, God willing, he is
going to pay!</p>

<p>"But I shall not jeopardize either of you, or your interests. I
shall wait until the spring drive is over, at which time my
association with your company must necessarily end. It really was
unnecessary for me to come down here, for whether you allow Hurd to
send some of his people to our schools or not does not change the
situation at all. Personally I am sure he was laughing in his
sleeve when he made that request. He is simply piling up written
evidence which at some future time can be made public as showing
his friendship for us. I would advise you to let him send the
children, if we have room. It can do no harm, and will do the
children good."</p>

<p>At half past nine he was ready to leave.</p>

<p>"You are not returning before dinner?" asked Colonel Denis in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"I am returning immediately," Clifton assured him.</p>

<p>He shook hands again, and bowed to Antoinette without advancing
a step across the width of the room which separated them. He did
not see the little movement she made, as if to meet him half-way.
He was blind to the whiteness in her cheeks, except as it was a
part of the strain and discomfort of an enforced meeting with one
whom she disliked so sincerely. He went out and walked down toward
his canoe without looking back.</p>

<p>In sheer amazement Colonel Denis turned to Antoinette.</p>

<p>"What in God's name has happened to Clifton Brant?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>He had noted her unusual pallor before, and that pallor was
accentuated now by eyes that were shining brimful of tears.</p>

<p>Denis's gaze slowly turned from her and followed after Clifton.
"Antoinette, <i>it is you</i>!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am afraid so, Colonel Denis."</p>

<p>There was a little break in her voice, a breath caught short and
smothered before it was a sob.</p>

<p>Clifton was bending over his canoe, and Denis watched him.</p>

<p>"I didn't think that of Clifton," he said after a moment. "I
didn't think a woman could ever do <i>that</i> to him. But I
suppose it's reasonable, if one knows the facts. It has hit him
hard because&mdash;well&mdash;I don't think Clifton ever looked at
a woman until he saw you. I'm sorry!"</p>

<p>"So am I," whispered Antoinette's trembling lips, but Denis did
not hear her. Outside the door he was shouting good-by to
Clifton.</p>

<p>For three weeks thereafter Clifton lived and slept and worked
with his men, and the logs piled up in the working camps with
amazing speed. He saw Gaspard twice, and Joe and Bim spent two
week-ends with him. But he did not see Antoinette, Angelique or
Catherine, though he knew where they were at all times. Antoinette
was now working with the other two, and through the Bolducs, one or
the other of whom was with him most of the time, he helped in the
activities for the big Christmas and New Year's festivities which
the girls were planning.</p>

<p>That week was destined to remain long in the memories of the
forest people. A dozen entertainments and plays were given in the
four schools. A Christmas tree as tall as the ceiling, ablaze with
candles and weighted with presents, was in each building. Clifton
went with Vincent to the school in charge of Catherine Clamart, and
the day after Christmas he left for a fortnight in Quebec. He sent
a Christmas greeting to each of the three girls and half a
canoeload of presents to Joe.</p>

<p>When he returned from Quebec the men were back at work again.
And a letter from Antoinette St. Ives was awaiting him at
Mistassini.</p>

<p>It was different from any of the few things she had ever written
him. All spirit and pride seemed gone from her writing. Very simply
she greeted him, thanked him for his thoughtfulness in sending her
a holiday token, and then in several pages poured out her heart to
him in a matter which was causing her great unrest. Where was
Alphonse? Why had he disappeared? And why did he not return? Only
answers to those questions could possibly quiet her misgiving and
worry. Gaspard had been able to tell her very little, except about
the rumors that Alphonse was wandering through the wilderness,
preaching in the camps. She thanked him again for the wonderful
work he had done, and assured him that nothing she could ever do
for him would sufficiently recompense him.</p>

<p>Clifton smiled when he read these last lines. It was a rare bit
of humor, he thought.</p>

<p>Then he answered her, and at length. But his letter, also, was
unlike anything he had ever written her. It was not strained or
formal, but no breath of his soul crept into it. He told her that
for some time he had felt it to be his duty to tell her certain
things about the monk, but circumstances had seemed to put
themselves between him and the opportunity.</p>

<p>Without betraying the secret of Gaspard's fight he told her of
his last minutes with Alphonse, and his disappearance. Since then
he had learned that Alphonse was spending a part of his time among
Hurd's camps, where of course his acquaintanceship with the St.
Iveses was unknown. At other times rumors had come to him of a
little wandering missioner farther west, whom he believed to be the
monk. Frankly he did not believe Alphonse would return until he had
accomplished a certain work which he had in mind. And maybe not
then. She could judge for herself by the monk's last words to him,
which he had quoted correctly.</p>

<p>Then he thanked her, in turn, for her kind appreciation of what
little he had helped to accomplish. He was grateful to her for her
well-wishes, but he was sure that her own example and the
inspiration of her ideas had almost wholly achieved their success.
This inspiration he assured her would always be a guiding light in
his own work, and especially would it help him in a rather
difficult task which he would face in the spring when he left to
take charge of the Chinese Government's reforestation work.</p>

<p>Antoinette was at Depot Number Two when he wrote this letter,
and the next day, when he went north, he passed Depot Number Two
without stopping and slept that night at Depot Number Three.</p>

<p>With the beginning of the hard snows the winter passed quickly
for Clifton. He had nearly four hundred men at work now and the
camps were humming with activity. A score of important details
outside of cutting the timber occupied his mind and time. Thousands
of cords of pulpwood had to be teamed over the snow to the edge of
the waterways, and as the loosening of the dam at the upper lake
would raise the water only in the Mistassini the problem confronted
him of getting back-country timber to the edge of the big river.
While he had planned so that sixty percent of his cut was along the
shores of the Mistassini, it was necessary for him to set twenty
teams at work on the back timber late in January.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful Canadian winter, cold and clear and with the
snow firm and not too heavy underfoot. Occasionally he saw
Angelique and Catherine, and he was delighted with their enthusiasm
and growing love for the forests. They never wanted to leave them,
they declared. With a radiant face Vincent confided his secret to
Clifton. The glorious Catherine and he were to be married in the
spring. They had planned to spend their lives in the wilderness,
doing the forest work which he loved&mdash;and which Catherine had
grown to love. God had been mighty good to him, he said; for when
one possessed a love like Catherine's one had to believe in God.
They went together. A love like that was a part of God, and he was
proud of his conviction in the matter.</p>

<p>Angelique went home for a visit late in January and did not
return until early in March, which added considerably to the work
of Antoinette and Catherine. Twice in February Clifton met
Antoinette, but he made no effort and showed no desire to be alone
with her. A third time, in March, he saw the three girls at Depot
Number Three, where they gave an evening's entertainment of music
and singing. He complimented the three together.</p>

<p>His eyes revealed nothing when he looked coolly at Antoinette,
and told her how wonderful the evening had been, and what an
inspiration it was to the forest people. She had flushed at his
coming and his first words, but when a moment later he bowed in
that cold, hard way that had become a part of him and left them to
mingle with the men and women and children who crowded the
school-room the color left her cheeks and she stood strangely
white.</p>

<p>Angelique's dark eyes had seen the color come and go and the
look that had followed Clifton, and a little later she tore herself
away from Gaspard long enough to catch Clifton alone as he was
prepared to leave.</p>

<p>For the first time in his experience her eyes flashed at him
angrily and her little hands were clenched as she cornered him.</p>

<p>"Now it is you who are the fool!" she cried hotly, but in a
voice so low that only he could hear it. "Antoinette sang her song
tonight for you&mdash;for you! And you're running away again. Oh!"
And she stamped her foot to give emphasis to her feeling.</p>

<p>"It was a beautiful song," he said, "and Antoinette was lovelier
than an angel. But until I approached her to offer my felicitation
she had not looked in my direction once this evening, Angelique. I
thank you, but you don't know how wrong you are in your judgment of
her emotions."</p>

<p>Angelique drew herself up until it seemed that every inch in her
slim little body was straining to come to a level with Clifton's
eyes.</p>

<p>"You are a bigger fool than I ever dreamed a man could
be&mdash;when it comes to understanding a woman!" she declared.</p>

<p>"I know it," he conceded amiably. "I've made an unforgettable
ass of myself."</p>

<p>She heaved a sigh of despair. "Then you believe that Antoinette
St. Ives does not care for you?"</p>

<p>"I believe that if she were a man she would deliberately force a
fight upon me."</p>

<p>"Dear Mother, have pity on him!" gasped Angelique, her eyes
devouring him with their fire. "Why&mdash;why&mdash;are you so
stupid that you did not see the color leap into her cheeks when you
came to her, or know that they went as suddenly white when you left
her?"</p>

<p>"Other emotions than love produce those same effects," answered
Clifton. "Extreme dislike, for instance."</p>

<p>Angelique settled back to her normal height.</p>

<p>"Hopeless, hopeless," she breathed. "I can do nothing with her,
and I can do nothing with you, yet I know that the hearts of both
of you are sick for that very thing which neither of you will bring
about. Sometimes I grow faint when I think that for a time I was
that way with Gaspard. If you two could have the sense of Vincent
and Catherine&mdash;if you&mdash;there comes Gaspard, shoving
everybody out of his way in his search for me!
And&mdash;Clifton&mdash;<i>Antoinette leaves for Quebec tomorrow
morning!</i>"</p>

<p>A few minutes later Clifton was on his way to Depot Number Four,
eight miles up the river. It was a moonlight night, splendid for
driving over a snowy trail beaten hard by the teamsters.</p>

<p>Late the following afternoon he received a telephone message
from Bolduc, at Mistassini. Incidentally he learned that Antoinette
St. Ives had arrived and arrangements had been made to drive her
over the ice of the lake to Roberval the following morning.</p>

<p>The next day was Thursday. Clifton rose to his work with a
strange feeling of despair and a still stranger feeling of
relief.</p>

<p>Antoinette St. Ives was gone out of his life, probably for all
time. He could concentrate himself now on the last great step he
must take before collecting his debt from Hurd.</p>

<p>And on this day of her going something else went out of the
forests for Clifton. Light, sunshine, hope and a part of his soul.
And a great loneliness crept in their place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p>Clifton now applied every energy and thought to making
preparations for the spring drive, and a subdued thrill of
excitement and suspense began to possess those who would be
responsible for its success or its failure. Hurd had his pulpwood
piled high along the Mistassini and the tributaries which he was
working, and there could be no secrecy in the efforts Clifton had
made to get his own timber down to the shore of the big river in
order to compete more favorably with his enemy when the first high
water came.</p>

<p>On the first of April the Bolducs reported that the boundary
line between the Laurentian and Hurd-Foy properties was patrolled
by Hurd's men night and day and that especial caution was being
employed along the river. Through a friend in the other camps
Delphis learned that Hurd had seemed to be highly amused when he
first discovered that Clifton was bringing down his wood from the
back-timber and piling it along the Mistassini instead of waiting
for spring to flood the creeks and do the work of the teams.</p>

<p>"Hurd has something up his sleeve," Delphis declared up to the
last moment. "I can't guess what it is. But it's something that
makes him mighty confident."</p>

<p>Clifton personally went up and down the streams and into the
back-country watching the progress of the days and marking the
first softening of the snows.</p>

<p>One day Romeo Lesage came to him about the baseball bats.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have them in handy places along the drive," he
said. "If we need them it will be sudden&mdash;and no time to
lose."</p>

<p>With the tenth of April came softening weather, warm suns, a
melting wind, and water began to run. Colonel Denis had reached
Mistassini, and came up to Depot Number Four.</p>

<p>Suspense crept into every man's blood. It found an outlet in the
cautious voices of women. There was a restlessness in the schools
during their last days. The shadow of impending drama, and possibly
of tragedy, hovered over the forests.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth Angelique Fanchon got Clifton on the telephone
from Depot Number Three.</p>

<p>"Antoinette St. Ives is at Roberval," she told him. "She was
just talking with me over the telephone. She will arrive at
Mistassini tomorrow. She said she must be here during the
drive&mdash;with you and the men. She said <i>with you</i>. And she
asked about you&mdash;if you were well, where you were!"</p>

<p>For a moment Clifton found no words with which to answer.</p>

<p>"Do you hear me?" asked Angelique.</p>

<p>"Yes, I hear you."</p>

<p>"And are you glad?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am glad."</p>

<p>A triumphant little laugh sounded at the other end.</p>

<p>"That's all I want, Clifton. I wanted you to say that so I could
tell Antoinette you said you were glad. Maybe I can do something
yet! Good-by!"</p>

<p>Then Delphis Bolduc brought him word that added to the thrills
of Angelique's message. Alphonse the monk was in Hurd's camps.
There was no doubt now. Delphis, spying like an Indian, had seen
him. And his friend had told him that this strange little missioner
was quite frequently with Hurd.</p>

<p>What could that mean?</p>

<p>Clifton slept not more than five or six hours out of each
twenty-four now. He went up to the dam with Vincent. The lake was
full. Twenty feet of water waited to be released.</p>

<p>A light telephone wire had been strung during the past month,
apparently running to an engineers' camp which the company had
built three miles from the lake. Here Vincent remained, waiting for
the word to blow up the dam.</p>

<p>When Clifton returned Antoinette was at Depot Number Two, on the
edge of Hurd's concession. It was here, and below, that he knew
trouble would come. And Antoinette had placed herself where the big
fight would begin, if there was to be fighting at all. Angelique
and Catherine were with her.</p>

<p>The ice was breaking. That word, sent up first from Mistassini,
and then coming down from Vincent on the upper waters, passed like
an electric shock from heart to heart. Each springtime the women
dreaded these terrible days that were coming, when their menfolk
took their lives in their hands, but this year a more oppressive
suspense and fear possessed them. But the word passing from lip to
lip and from camp to camp inspired the men. They were like men
preparing to go into battle. Their blood ran restlessly. The great
thrill which comes with the facing of a mighty hazard was in
them.</p>

<p>The warm, gray night of April twentieth came without a moon.
There were stars and a dull light in the sky. Until dusk not a soul
but Clifton, the Bolducs, Lesage, Gaspard and Vincent up at the
lake knew this was the night on which the great coup was to be
sprung on Ivan Hurd.</p>

<p>Even Denis, at Depot Number Two, was unaware of the exact
time.</p>

<p>It was a little after midnight when a pounding at the door of
their cabin roused the three girls.</p>

<p>A voice called from outside, "Colonel Denis wants you to dress
and come to the office!"</p>

<p>In a panic of excitement they obeyed. Antoinette's curls
smothered her neck and shoulders. Catherine's golden braid was half
undone and she did not wait to plait it. Angelique failed to wipe
the beauty-cream entirely from her face.</p>

<p>Denis was walking back and forth over the bare wood floor of the
office when they came in together. His tense face twisted itself in
a smile when he saw how evidently they had hastened to obey his
summons.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to alarm you," he said. "But you have been three
faithful goddesses to the cause, and I promised to let you know the
minute I received word that the final hour had struck." He looked
up at the clock on the wall. It was a quarter after twelve. "Since
nine o'clock last night Clifton Brant and three hundred men have
been throwing logs into the Mistassini!" he added, and there was a
strange tremble in his voice.</p>

<p>"God bless Clifton Brant!" whispered Angelique Fanchon.</p>

<p>Their faces had grown whiter and more tense, with Colonel
Denis's.</p>

<p>The eyes of Antoinette St. Ives were like blazing stars.</p>

<p>"Yes, God be with him and help him," she said, and in the pale
lamp-glow her white hand made the sign of the cross on her
breast.</p>

<p>Denis tried to appear calm.</p>

<p>"In fifteen minutes&mdash;exactly thirty minutes after
twelve&mdash;Vincent will blow up the dam!"</p>

<p>A stifled sob came from Catherine Clamart. For a moment she
covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>"God bless him, too," Angelique said, trying to laugh a little.
"And my Gaspard? I suppose he is pitching logs!"</p>

<p>"He is at the head of fifty men whose duty it will be to keep
the logs moving and free from jams," said Denis. "Shall we move
outside? It is a quiet night, and I think we can hear."</p>

<p>The camp was asleep when they went out. There were no lights in
the other buildings. Stillness hung heavily over the wilderness.
Stars gleamed dimly in the skies and under these stars the steady
murmur of the river and the whispering of the forest was a soft
melody of restfulness and peace. Denis wet his forefinger and held
it above his head. The gently stirring wind was in the right
direction to bring sound from the north.</p>

<p>The three girls stood in a little group. They seemed scarcely to
move or breathe as the minutes passed. Their eyes glowed and their
faces were tense and pale in the starlight as they waited. Denis
struck a match and lighted a cigaret. The tiny flare illuminated
the set lines in his face. He looked at his watch before the flame
went out.</p>

<p>"Twenty-seven minutes past twelve," he said softly.</p>

<p>Antoinette stood with Angelique's warm fingers clasped in her
hand. Catherine was a step aside, her golden head high, listening,
her eyes shining, an infinite pride and faith in her attitude.</p>

<p>"Oh, Vincent!" she whispered. "Do it! <i>Do it!</i>"</p>

<p>Denis could hear the swift ticking of his watch.</p>

<p>"Listen hard," he said. "It is time!"</p>

<p>Every sound seemed to grow in volume then, the murmur of the
river, the whisperings in the forest, the beating of their
hearts&mdash;and through it all at last came a sound that was like
a smothered moan that disturbed the length and breadth of the
night, a sound that rose through a second or two until the earth
and the air seemed to tremble with it, faint, illusive,
gone&mdash;a ghost of a sound that came and passed and left the
stillness of the night heavier than before.</p>

<p>"Done!" cried Colonel Denis.</p>

<p>A sobbing cry of triumph came from Catherine. "I knew he'd do
it! Oh, I knew he'd do it!"</p>

<p>They went back into the lighted cabin. Denis, even in his
triumph, was amazed at Antoinette St. Ives. He had never seen the
look that was in her eyes. Her cheeks were no longer pale but were
flooded with a wild color and wet with tears. She made no effort to
hide them or wipe them away. A strange pride and glory were in her
face as well as in Catherine Clamart's. Angelique saw it, and
wanted to cry out in her joy&mdash;cry out so that Clifton might
hear, miles and miles up the river.</p>

<p>Denis looked at his watch again.</p>

<p>"You'd better return to your beds, young ladies," he advised
paternally. "The dam is out, but it will take hours for the water
to get down to us. You would be sleeping now if it were not for the
promise I gave you, and so I must insist that you resume your
broken rest. I am going to set you an example immediately."</p>

<p>Half an hour later his light was out, but looking from the
darkened window of their own cabin Antoinette knew that he was not
asleep, but wide awake, and that he was waiting for any word that
might come over the telephone, and for the arrival of dawn.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to sleep," said Catherine. "I am going to
finish doing up my hair." They could hear her brushing it in the
darkness. "If I could talk with Vincent over the telephone I would
give&mdash;almost anything!"</p>

<p>"And if I could be with Gaspard, helping him shove logs into the
river, I'd give more than that!" whispered Angelique, as the flip,
flip, flip of her boot-laces told them that she was further
preparing herself for action instead of undressing for bed. "Ugh!"
she shivered. "Can't you see them?&mdash;three hundred men working
like demons all through this darkness, three hundred men straining
and fighting almost for their lives, three hundred of
them&mdash;while every cabin in the woods is lighted, and women and
children are awake, listening, waiting&mdash;a lot of them praying!
Dear Mother, it's almost like <i>war</i>!"</p>

<p>A quick breath came from Antoinette at the window.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of that," she said, and in her voice, low and
soft though it was, came clearly a note that made Angelique pause
in the lacing of her boots. "As we were riding in an automobile
from Brantford one day Colonel Denis told me of another night like
this, years ago, when the work of Captain Brant and three hundred
men turned the tide of the next day's battle. He said they
accomplished what it would have seemed impossible for a thousand
men to do, and because they were three hundred then, as tonight,
and were working against such odds&mdash;just as they are doing
now&mdash;I, was thinking, too, Angelique!"</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence in the room, broken only by the
flip of Angelique's laces and the silken swish of Catherine's
hair.</p>

<p>"That was in the winter of nineteen-fifteen, near St. Eloi,"
continued Antoinette softly. "It was terrible&mdash;in the
trenches. And ahead of those trenches Captain Brant and his three
hundred heroes were digging through ice and snow&mdash;almost with
their naked hands, with the German guns tearing at them through
darkness that was like black pitch, Colonel Denis says. Thinking of
that&mdash;makes me want to go out&mdash;and fight with them
tonight!"</p>

<p>"With him, you mean," said Angelique, but the words were
whispered only to herself.</p>

<p>And Catherine said, resting her brush for an instant, "Vincent
has told me that everything depends on this night!"</p>

<p>"Yes, everything," said Antoinette. "And yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I was only thinking again."</p>

<p>"And so was I," said Angelique. "I was thinking. What if this
night does end in failure, God granting that it gives back to us
these men of ours! <i>Ours</i>, I said, Antoinette! Did you hear
me?"</p>

<p>She heard very faintly the answer from the window. "Yes, I heard
you."</p>

<p>In the darkness Angelique's face was afire with triumph and joy.
But her lips were silent. She went to the window and took
Antoinette's head in her arms, and kissed her. From one or the
other of them Catherine heard a little sob.</p>

<p>Through the night they kept their vigil, whispering of a hundred
happenings of the winter, and at times if Denis had stood outside
he would have listened to soft laughter breaking the tension of the
hours.</p>

<p>In the deeper blackness of approaching dawn there came suddenly
the swift clatter of hoofs out of the forest trail. The girls
hurried to the window and could faintly see the shadow of a
horseman passing. The hoof-beats stopped at the depot office. They
heard a beating at the door. In another half-minute a light was
burning in Denis's room.</p>

<p>"Something&mdash;has happened!" gasped Catherine, fear choking
her voice. "He was galloping&mdash;in the dark!"</p>

<p>It was Antoinette who groped her way first toward the door. Out
in the night Angelique found her hand and it was cold as ice.</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;if anything had happened&mdash;the word would
come by telephone&mdash;"</p>

<p>But they were dead white when they entered the office where
Denis had made up Bolduc's cot near the telephone.</p>

<p>Denis was already at the telephone, his back toward them.</p>

<p>He was at Cambrai and Sanctuary Wood again! His voice rang out
with military sharpness, sending a thrilling command to the
watchers who had leaped to their telephones along the line at the
first signal of the bell.</p>

<p>"This is Colonel Denis at Depot Number Two Wherever Captain
Brant is, get him immediately! Tell him it is a matter of life and
death and that I must talk with him at the earliest possible
moment! Send every available man after him&mdash;<i>and
hurry</i>!"</p>

<p>Scarcely were the words out of his mouth when a dull tremor ran
through the earth. The tremor was followed by a second and a third;
the log walls shivered; a roar swept out of the night&mdash;a roar
that seemed to fill the whole world, tearing at the sky, upheaving
the wilderness, shaking the earth, and sweeping off into distance
like the crashing thunder of a thousand mighty cart-wheels rolling
on pavements above the clouds.</p>

<p>A sharp cry came with the explosion&mdash;and that cry was in
the cabin. It came from a figure standing in half gloom, a figure
with a white and staring face and cavernous eyes whose sunken flame
devoured Antoinette St. Ives as she stood in the yellow glow of the
lamp.</p>

<p>It was Alphonse the monk.</p>

<p>And before shock could give way to a word of greeting, before
she could find strength to move or reach out her hands, Alphonse
darted with the swiftness of an animal to the door and disappeared
into the night. In an instant she followed and called his name. The
abandoned horse whinnied. The last whisperings of the convulsion
that had shaken the universe were dying away. A moment she
listened&mdash;holding her breath&mdash;and then turned to confront
the ironically smiling, deathlike face of John Denis.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p>"What is it?" she demanded. "Alphonse riding in like
that&mdash;the explosion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is Ivan Hurd playing his last card," said Denis, the smile
remaining on his white lips. "He has blown the top of Sandstone
Mountain into the Mistassini down there a mile or so, where the
river is shallow and scarcely two hundred feet wide. Alphonse only
learned tonight that the mines have been laid for three weeks past.
They were to have been fired when high water came and our logs were
in the river, but in some way Hurd discovered the meaning of our
activities and has sent an avalanche into the Mistassini at a
peculiarly embarrassing moment for us. If his plans work out there
will be the biggest and most impossible log jam in the river's
history at that particular point. And the logs will be our logs,
forming a monster dam which will hold back the water of our lake
reservoir long enough to allow Hurd to get a great quantity of his
own timber into the river. Pretty, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Catherine drew in a gasping breath.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;he is going to steal the water from Vincent's
dam?"</p>

<p>"That's it, partly. And while he is doing that, if his dynamite
has been successful, our logs will be tying themselves into knots
which will be enormously difficult to untangle, even when the
spring floods come. Father Alphonse will return with definite
information regarding the success of Hurd's exploded mines within
an hour or two. Meanwhile&mdash;"</p>

<p>The jangling of the telephone bell interrupted him. He took down
the receiver and in answer to his hello the girls could hear an
indistinct voice at the other end. Then it grew silent, and in the
pause Denis said:</p>

<p>"Thank God, Captain Brant has just come into Depot Number Four!
They'll have him on the line&mdash;" He turned suddenly to the
telephone. "What? Yes, this is Denis&mdash;Colonel Denis&mdash;at
Number Two! Is that you, Clifton? Can you hear me
clearly&mdash;"</p>

<p>Scarcely breathing, the girls listened as Denis briefly and
without apparent excitement or waste of words described the new and
sinister situation that had developed a mile and a half inside the
Hurd-Foy limits. When he had finished they could hear Clifton's
voice snapping with almost electrical sharpness over the line. They
caught the words dynamite&mdash;high water&mdash;logs passing
down&mdash;twenty-four miles&mdash;three or four hours&mdash;and
then it ended. Denis hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>"What did he say?" demanded Antoinette.</p>

<p>Denis was a little nervous.</p>

<p>"He said the reservoir water was at its peak at Depot Number
Four and that logs had been rushing toward us for an hour! He said
there was only one way for him to get down to us within three or
four hours and that was by taking a chance on the high water in a
canoe! If he can escape the logs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you stood there and made no objection to that?" cried
Antoinette, springing toward him. "My God, it is death! I
know&mdash;because I saw it happen a long time ago&mdash;and the
men I looked at were crushed to pieces like bits of paper! It can't
happen again! It shall not! I won't let Gaspard come down among the
logs&mdash;and&mdash;<i>I won't let Captain Brant do it</i>."</p>

<p>She was at the telephone before she had finished speaking and
was ringing desperately. The voice answered again. Was Captain
Brant there? Was it too late to get him? They must try!</p>

<p>An interval followed&mdash;minute after minute, each almost
without end; and then the voice returned. Antoinette St. Ives
listened to it for a moment. She made no answer. Slowly she faced
Colonel Denis.</p>

<p>"It is too late! He is risking his life to come down and do what
you are not man enough to do!"</p>

<p>She seemed not to see Angelique or Catherine as she left the
office, white to the lips. In a moment or two they followed her.
Colonel Denis stood alone, like one stricken. Then a shadow of a
smile twitched at the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>"Lucky Clifton! If you could only know you are coming&mdash;to
<i>that</i>!" he breathed softly, and went to the door to find that
dawn was breaking.</p>

<p>In the gray of that dawn Clifton was shooting down the river
with Delphis Bolduc in the stern of his canoe. Half a dozen times
they seemed to be facing death, but each time crept out. Twice the
logs almost carried them over rock-ramparted falls where their
bodies would have been beaten to pulp. The tremendous strain they
were under Clifton could see in Bolduc's face. He had never seen
Delphis so white and gaunt. He seemed to have lost flesh.</p>

<p>When at last the prow of their canoe shoved in on the sand-bar
at Depot Number Three he wondered if he looked as badly as Delphis.
He tried to laugh, and Delphis tried to laugh, but their voices
were strained and unreal. Probably no one would ever quite guess
the hell they had gone through, with a million logs tearing ahead
of them and behind them and racing shoulder to shoulder with the
canoe.</p>

<p>It annoyed him that a tremble should be in his
voice&mdash;something which he could not control. He did not feel
nervous or afraid. At least he assured himself this was so.</p>

<p>They swallowed hot coffee and food hurriedly while the clerk got
Denis on the telephone. Clifton talked with him. The logs had not
yet begun to arrive at Depot Number Two. But Hurd's mountain-slide
was a diabolical success. The logs would jam. A huge mass of stone
had settled in the middle of that narrow part of the stream, and
between that mass and both shores great boulders had flung
themselves like monster dragon teeth, waiting for the timber.
Clifton's last instruction was for Denis to get dynamite and all
available men at the scene of the anticipated jam. He and Delphis
would be with them in an hour and a half&mdash;if nothing
happened.</p>

<p>Two hours later they passed the deserted lower depot and came to
a group of people waiting on a projecting bar just above Sandstone
Mountain. Their canoe was ragged and leaking water. Their faces
were whiter, thinner, more terrible looking. They were like two men
who had come out of something ghastly and indescribable. Those
ashore were tense and dumb with a kind of hopelessness that had
settled on them like a shock, but the ghostly terribleness of the
two men who got stiffly out of the canoe relieved them of their own
emotions for a few moments.</p>

<p>Clifton looked them over at a glance, and a grunt told him that
Delphis had done the same. There were thirty or forty, some of them
women and children. Every available river-man had been enlisted in
the work upstream, and here were only the roustabouts of the camp,
half a dozen teamsters, the cook's outfit and a few others.</p>

<p>Clifton saw none of Hurd's people. But he did see Antoinette St.
Ives, Angelique Fanchon and Catherine Clamart only a few steps away
from him, white-faced and staring as Denis met him and Bolduc.
Denis gripped their hands. But he did not speak. There was little
need of that. Clifton and Delphis could see for themselves.</p>

<p>They turned their backs to the little crowd, and for the first
time in hours a smile broke Clifton's lips as he saw in a more
leisurely manner what Ivan Hurd had done. It was a good job. He
looked up at the top of Sandstone Mountain, and then back again. In
war Hurd's mind would have been an asset to the Huns. It was
trickery, well done, absolutely effective, and somehow his mind
flashed back to those days of Langemarck, in this very month of
April in 1915, when the Huns first used poison gas. He could see
again the French colonial Turcos and African Zouaves as they
stampeded, fainting and choking and dying in the mysterious scourge
as they ran&mdash;and then the Canadians filling that horrible gap
that opened up the roads to Ypres, Calais and the English
Channel&mdash;and holding the Germans back. Ivan Hurds were behind
that gas-death. And here was an Ivan Hurd again, doing the last
thing in the world that a white man would have expected him to
do!</p>

<p>He forgot the little crowd of breathless, waiting men and women
behind them as he surveyed Hurd's work. But he did not forget
Antoinette St. Ives! She was there, watching him&mdash;and what an
infinite contempt must fill her soul now as she saw him utterly
beaten, the Laurentian Company beaten, herself beaten&mdash;because
he had not possessed sufficient foresight to watch the top of
Sandstone Mountain!</p>

<p>For beaten they were, as surely as the sun was shining upon them
from out of the east! He heard Bolduc groan the words under his
breath. And he could see.</p>

<p>A moaning roar and turmoil of water filled the air, and where
the channel had been there was no longer a channel but a piled-up
chaos of logs. Over this mass and about it the flood from the upper
lake, filled with its volleys of timber, was crashing and beating
with increasing violence, and as the two surveyed the pile there
came suddenly a great upheaval in the center of it which lifted the
growing mountain of logs half a dozen feet in less than thirty
seconds.</p>

<p>Bolduc gave a sharp exclamation as his hand gripped Clifton's
arm. That upheaval had revealed to them where the keystone to the
great jam lay. The thought was in Clifton's eyes as he looked at
Delphis. They walked on, alone, until they were half a hundred
paces away from the little crowd of spectators&mdash;for in this
crisis Clifton regarded them as no more than that.</p>

<p>Again their eyes met.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's the mass of stone in the center," said Bolduc, as if
Clifton had spoken the thought in his mind. "A charge of dynamite
in the right place&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, waiting for Clifton to give expression in words to
what he saw. Clifton's lips were set hard. He was not afraid. But
he was white. And Bolduc's face was like flesh that had hardened
into wood, with its myriad little lines accentuated and its eyes
looking out of half closed slits.</p>

<p>"There's a million horse-power of water crowding behind it,"
answered Clifton. "A charge of dynamite would loosen that central
pile, and once loosened, even a little, the mass of rock would be
leveled and scattered by the sheer force of the water and timber
shoving from behind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>but</i>!" challenged Delphis.</p>

<p>"A man would not come out alive."</p>

<p>"Possibly. But the timber would go down."</p>

<p>"Yes, it would go down."</p>

<p>They stood shoulder to shoulder. Bolduc laughed, but his laugh
was not as hard as it had been at another time that day.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't do it for Denis," he said. "I wouldn't do it for any
man or company on earth. But&mdash;I hate to have Hurd beat us like
this!"</p>

<p>Clifton spoke as quietly. "If you will get the dynamite,
Delphis, and tell Denis to keep himself and the people
back&mdash;especially the people&mdash;"</p>

<p>No one saw the close, sudden grip of their hands in front of
them.</p>

<p>Bolduc was gone no more than a minute or two and until he
returned Clifton did not take his eyes from the jam.</p>

<p>"I told them we were going to try a little experiment along the
edge, and warned them to get back," said Denis. "The charges are
ready, with two-minute fuses. One each is enough."</p>

<p>They faced the boiling caldron of logs between them and the
piled-up mass in the middle of the stream. This was the death-trap.
They could cross it with caution and luck; but to get back again,
and within those precious two minutes after the fuse was
lighted&mdash;</p>

<p>"The instant the charge goes off the mass will begin to move,"
Delphis was saying, "and that will give more freedom between us and
the main pile. It is clear, Monsieur, that when we have placed the
charges <i>we must hurry</i>!"</p>

<p>For a moment some force drew Clifton about so that he was
seeking Antoinette St. Ives. She was standing with Colonel Denis a
little in advance of the others, looking at him. He turned to
Bolduc again.</p>

<p>"Shall we go?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;straight across for that spout of white froth. Don't
wait or watch for me. Get to the pile first. If either of us
slips&mdash;the other must go on <i>alone</i>."</p>

<p>A cry so shrill that it was almost a scream came from behind
them as they leaped out into the twisting maelstrom of timber.
Clifton heard the cry and it was like a knife running through him,
and with it he heard his name, and then all sound was drowned in
the grind and roar of rushing water and of logs in moaning turmoil.
He did not see Bolduc. He did not raise his eyes as he made the
death-race for the firmer footing ahead. Twice they opened and let
him down to his knees. Once he slipped almost to his waist but got
out with lightning quickness before the timber trap closed again to
grip and crush him. It was all over in three-quarters of a minute.
He reached the solid jam. And Bolduc came staggering up, white as
ash, a limp in his last steps, and dripping water.</p>

<p>In another half-minute they had found a hollow in the heart of
the jam almost directly back of the obstructing mass of rock and
gravel. Here they could hear more clearly the tearing force of the
water on both sides of them. They had guessed correctly. If they
could free this central leverage a ten-thousand-ton battering-ram
of timber behind would scatter Hurd's avalanche as if it were made
of paper!</p>

<p>Delphis had taken his waterproof match-box from his pocket.
Clifton held the dynamite, with the ends of the two fuses close
together. The instant they were lighted he would drop them in a
deep crevice that ran down at the back of the rock.</p>

<p>Until the match was sputtering between Bolduc's thumb and
forefinger he had not noticed that the other's hand was shaking. He
looked up. Bolduc's face was twisted with pain.</p>

<p>A sputter&mdash;a sudden snake-like hiss&mdash;</p>

<p>"Drop it!"</p>

<p>The dynamite fell from Clifton's hands, dropping dully into the
depths of the timber. A pungent film of smoke rose out of the
crevice.</p>

<p>In half a second Clifton was away from it and climbing with the
swiftness of a cat out of the hollow. He came over the crest and
saw the crowd on shore. It had come closer to the river. He could
see Denis. And then Antoinette. She stood with her booted feet in
the shore wash of foam and water sent up by the flood. It struck
him then that everyone was behind her&mdash;even Denis; that she
was alone, poised almost as if on the point of coming out to meet
him, and that even Catherine and Angelique did not come to her
side, but left for her alone that one position on a projecting
shelf of rock that was nearest him. She had reached her arms out as
he appeared, and he could see that she was calling to him, or to
someone behind him, though he could not hear her voice.</p>

<p>He turned as he came to the edge of the solid jam and looked for
Bolduc.</p>

<p>Delphis had been slow&mdash;terribly slow. His head and
shoulders were just appearing out of the hollow. And then, as he
came out, horror and shock swept over Clifton, when he saw that
Delphis was dragging himself on his hands and knees!</p>

<p>He ran back, and as he ran he could hear now the cry that came
from the people on shore. Delphis fell almost to his face, and then
pulled himself up with an effort, like a drunken man. He was
crumpling back again when Clifton reached him and flung an arm
about him. Delphis's white lips spoke.</p>

<p>"My leg. I can't use it. Smashed&mdash;I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>He swayed almost a dead weight for a few precious seconds, and
then Clifton got in front of him, with his back doubled over. Like
a bag of wheat he pulled Delphis on his shoulders. His eyes were on
a level with the shore as he staggered over the uneven, swaying
mass of pulpwood, and he saw the change that was keeping help back
from the other side of the channel. For a few moments the channel
had opened between the rocks, and logs in a crashing bombardment
were smashing their way through it. They jammed again even as he
looked. But no living thing could get across that space now.</p>

<p>Bolduc almost forced himself from his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;alone!" he demanded. "You can't make it&mdash;with
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Clifton dug his fingers more tightly into his arms. Then he
slipped, and they fell. In that moment he saw the white-faced
crowd, and Antoinette standing at the end of the slim finger of
rock. He looked at her, and smiled. She must have seen it, for her
hands suddenly covered her face, and while he was still
looking&mdash;and straining to get up with Bolduc on his
shoulders&mdash;the explosion came, one, and then another, so close
together that there was scarcely an interval between them. There
was a lurch in the great mass, a roar that seemed to work deep down
into the bowels of the river, upheavals, and a cataclysmic eruption
at the center of the pile which set the earth and the mountains
atremble with its force.</p>

<p>And then a mighty arm seemed to reach out and possess itself of
Clifton. It jerked him away from Bolduc. It flung him back, tossed
him up with a sudden spurt of timber, and when he recovered from
the shock the place where he had been standing was gone, Delphis
was gone, and all about him the freed masses were breaking
up&mdash;and from the shore came such a cry as he had never heard
in all his life!</p>

<p>It was a crowd cry, a shriek of women, a moaning protest of men,
a cry of amazement and of horror and of shock.</p>

<p>And a still more terrible cry came from Clifton.</p>

<p>It was not because he was facing certain death, and was about to
die as Delphis had died under the eyes of the people ashore. That
was terrible enough. But this that was happening was more than the
mere spectacle of death&mdash;men's death.</p>

<p>Antoinette St. Ives had leaped straight out from the tip of the
rock into the milling swirl of logs between him and the shore!</p>

<p>"I am coming!" he heard her cry. "<i>I am coming!</i>"</p>

<p>A figure ran and leaped close behind her. It was Alphonse. He
missed, a log struck him ashore, hands seized him&mdash;and held
him.</p>

<p>But no hand could reach Antoinette. It was a miracle, a divine
intuition that carried her feet over the maelstrom of flood and
twisting, foam-hidden logs. A slip, a misstep, and death lay ready
to engulf and crush the life from her. And she seemed to be looking
at nothing&mdash;caring for nothing&mdash;but Clifton.</p>

<p>The cry that was in his soul died there as he sprang toward her,
no longer caring what might happen to himself if he could reach her
before the fatal moment came. There was no hope for either of them
now. He could see that, and those ashore could see it. The whole
jam was giving way. The wall of water was moaning and roaring
behind. Half a minute more&mdash;twenty seconds&mdash;maybe
less&mdash;</p>

<p>They met on a footing of timber half as big as the floor of a
small room, and as Antoinette came to him out of mist and spray
that was golden with the morning sun the glory in her face and eyes
was that of one who had come to a great triumph, and in that
triumph had forgotten the thing called death.</p>

<p>There were a few moments left to them. He caught her as her slim
body came within his reach. Her hands went swiftly to his face and
then around his neck. It was she who spoke in his hour of horror
and despair when God had taken the power of speech from his
tongue.</p>

<p>"<i>I love you,</i>" she was saying. "<i>I love you&mdash;I love
you.</i>"</p>

<p>Her lips were against his, not cold with the chill of fear and
death, but warm&mdash;warmer than on that night of the great
storm!</p>

<p>"<i>I love you&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>Death was about them&mdash;upon them. It rolled and shuddered
under them. Clifton crushed her in his arms, and his eyes sought
the hopeless shore. Yet he leaped toward it as the floor of timber
melted away from under their feet.</p>

<p>And then the boiling floods reached up. Light and the world
disappeared as the chaos engulfed them. But he had her in his arms
as they went&mdash;so close that death would never be able to
separate them. That was his thought. <i>Death would not separate
them</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p>In the rumble and roar that filled his ears he was conscious of
but one necessity&mdash;to keep his arms about the one who had
given herself to him in the moment when he was about to die.</p>

<p>They were under water and he could hear the moaning and sweep
and drumming of it in his ears, and above all that the steady
thunder of timber above them, and a still more terrible sound where
in places the crowded logs were reaching down and tearing at the
river-bed itself. Caught in this drag they would be torn and
shredded into pieces like cloth, and so his first struggle was
upward&mdash;up to a more merciful death of clean drowning or to be
beaten lifeless but not so terribly obliterated by the upper
logs.</p>

<p>He was amazed at the swiftness with which the water was carrying
them and its freedom from obstruction. A thrill leaped suddenly
into his brain and sped to the nerves and sinews of his body. His
left arm was about Antoinette, holding her head close to him. He
freed his right. With that and his legs he struggled upward. The
current caught and twisted him, and suddenly he felt himself in a
powerful undertow that swirled him about like a chip and then sent
him to the surface in the boiling heart of it.</p>

<p>Fresh air struck his face and filled his nostrils and his lungs,
and in that same instant he felt the undertow dragging him back
again. He flung out his free arm and something sped under it. It
was a spruce log, barkless, not over six inches in diameter and
four feet long&mdash;a mere pencil in the flood, but enough. He
could bring his face out of the water, and Antoinette's. She was
gasping and choking for air. But she was unhurt. Her eyes were open
<i>and looking at him</i>. He thanked God, and for the first time
was inspired by the thought that they were going to live.</p>

<p>And in this same moment there began to possess him the almost
unbelievable force of the thing that had sent Antoinette to him. It
battled against the roaring in his head. It cleared his vision,
swept doubt from his mind, and in the twistings of the flood with
its hundred chances of death his heart and soul leaped to the
glorious thrill of it. All life was reaching ahead of him
again&mdash;life filled with Antoinette! She loved him and had come
to him in an hour of hopelessness that they might go down and out
together!</p>

<p>And now he knew they would live! The logs would not crush them,
the floods could not drown them! For an instant so swift in passing
that it seemed a dream he saw Antoinette's eyes looking up at him
from a white face framed in a swirl of water. And he saw in them
what her lips had spoken!</p>

<p>As he raised himself an inch or two higher he saw how closely
death had missed them. The spout of the undertow had forced them up
through an embrasure in the mass of grinding timber&mdash;into a
pool, a <i>soupirail</i>, a tiny lakelet of clear water about which
the logs had crowded and tangled themselves. It was not more than
twenty feet across, and now he saw that the small spruce log had
been part of a boom and that a chain fastened somewhere ahead was
dragging it.</p>

<p>His mind gathered itself swiftly. Such an opening in the mass of
timber could last only for a few minutes. A few key timbers were
holding it temporarily. A change in the current, a shallower part
of the stream, an up-jutting rock&mdash;any one of a dozen things
and the key timbers would be disturbed and the mass would crowd in
and crush them.</p>

<p>He began to work along the log and then along the chain, keeping
it under the pit of his arm. He fought with all his strength,
working against the backlash of the water, and Antoinette's free
hand gripped the chain and helped him. It took him no more than two
or three minutes to reach the edge of the mass and pull himself up.
There he sank down, exhausted, his wind gone, but with Antoinette
held so closely in his arms that her head could not move from its
place on his breast.</p>

<p>For a little while they did not move or speak but lay in a
crumpled, sodden heap with their hearts pounding against each
other. Then the white face on Clifton's breast raised itself to
him. Two dripping arms crept up around his neck. A pair of lips
sought his and kissed him. And the soft mouth did not draw away but
pressed sweetly to his own when Clifton kissed it again as he had
done on the night of the storm.</p>

<p>Then Clifton stood up and drew Antoinette with him, his arms
still closely about her.</p>

<p>Sandstone Mountain with its ragged perpendicular walls had
slipped behind them. They could see the rapids through which they
had come, its boiling water filled with logs that leaped and
plunged like playing porpoises. On either side of them was dense
forest. The water was quieter but the swift and sullen way in which
the broken drifts of timber were speeding downstream told Clifton
they were on the crest of the flood and that the mighty force which
was propelling them would rend itself in still greater fury at the
next fall and rapids. At the rate they were drifting they would
reach this new danger in less than a dozen minutes.</p>

<p>Shoreward lay their hope.</p>

<p>Antoinette looked again at Clifton. And now, with her eyes clear
of water and mist she saw that he was not the man who had swayed
out of the canoe with Delphis Bolduc. The hard lines were gone from
his face. Age had died out of his eyes, and it came to her that he
was all at once the old Clifton Brant of the highways again, the
Clifton Brant whose smiling eyes and debonair wave of hand she had
first seen on the road from Brantford Town, the man who had made
chums of Joe and Bim and who from the very beginning of things had
laughed in the face of the world and had made light of everything
that was black and grim. For he was smiling, and about him there
was no sign of uncertainty or fear but only that monumental
confidence which at first had disheveled her pride but which now
made her want to get down on her knees and thank God for being good
and gracious enough to give it to him.</p>

<p>There was gladness in her low cry as she put her hands to his
face.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've loved you from the beginning&mdash;from that very
first hour in Hurd's room! And if it happens that you despise me
for what I have said and done to you I shall want to die here, just
so that you are kind enough to hold your arms about me while we are
going. I am not afraid!"</p>

<p>In sheer madness of joy he laughed as he kissed her upturned
lips and eyes and the wet hair that framed her face.</p>

<p>"We're going ashore!" he cried. "Come, <i>cara sposa</i>&mdash;"
And his joy rose above the moaning tumult of the water and logs.
"It's going to be easy now."</p>

<p>Yet he knew he was lying to himself, and to her. And Antoinette
St. Ives knew the same thing as hand in hand they faced the hazard
with happiness swelling in their hearts.</p>

<p>He was measuring his time, even with that lightsomeness in his
voice and the joy in his heart, and he knew there was not a second
or a half-second to lose. They hurried to the edge of the floating
timbers and Antoinette did not hesitate or question him when the
logs thinned out and no longer made a floor for them. The pressure
of his hand and the light in his face were all the surety she
needed, and when he dared turn his eyes swiftly to look at her for
an instant her lips flashed him a smile and her eyes were dark and
glowing with the splendor of her love and faith and
fearlessness.</p>

<p>"We'll go as far as we can," he told her cheerfully, as the log
footing began to sway and sink under them at each step. "Then we'll
jump in, and get ashore."</p>

<p>She wondered for a moment if there really was great
danger&mdash;if Clifton could talk like that, with a half-smile on
his lips and a struggle for their lives ahead of them! She looked a
last time at the distance between them and the shore. It was not
great, not more than thirty or forty yards. But it seemed to her
like a mill-race through which individual logs were rushing with
terrific speed and the force of battering-rams. Was it possible
Clifton saw no great difficulty in passing through <i>that</i>?</p>

<p>Very gently the river seemed to reach up and seize her, and at
first she went into it to her knees and then to her waist and her
shoulders&mdash;and at that level the logs seemed flashing past her
and beside her at still greater speed. And that half-smile was on
Clifton's lips even then as he held her again with his left arm and
began to fight the crowding logs with his right.</p>

<p>Ten minutes&mdash;possibly no more than seven or eight were left
to them now! His only chance was to pull himself through the logs
as they sped down-stream, make them crowd and batter him shoreward,
fight his way inch by inch and foot by foot&mdash;and every instant
keep his own body between Antoinette and their blows.</p>

<p>And he did that thing. Wrenched and torn he was thrown at last
into the top of a fallen birch. He dragged himself ashore and
pulled himself up to safety with Antoinette in his arms. The smile
was gone. A twist of agony had settled in his face. Maybe his ribs
were gone or his back caved in. It felt like that, he thought. He
tried to force back his cheer as he sank to the ground.</p>

<p>"Beastly&mdash;wind&mdash;gone," he gasped. "A close rub, little
girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was no use smiling now. White horror was in Antoinette's
face as she caught his sinking head in her arms. A red discoloring
of blood began to stain her torn and sodden dress. She cried out to
him passionately, and he tried to answer as he felt himself going
back more heavily into her arms. And then he could hear her sobbing
voice dying away. It was his eyes he was conscious of
last&mdash;the warmth of her lips against them.</p>

<p>Then came darkness.</p>

<p>The darkness lasted for only a little while, he thought, and as
it began to break away he was conscious of voices, far away at
first and then quite near him. With light and sound came swiftly an
adjustment of his thinking faculties. It had been a close shave!
That was his first mental sensation&mdash;and the logs must have
pummeled him unmercifully to lay him out like this at the last
moment, when he should be comforting Antoinette in place of
frightening her to death with his stupid helplessness.</p>

<p>This thought made him try to get up, even before the darkness
was gone or sound came clearly, and as he made the effort he called
to Antoinette. Something held him back. Then she answered him. Her
voice was very close. He felt her arms about his head. And it was
all so comforting and the thought of her safety was so immeasurably
satisfying that he sighed deeply and made no effort to raise
himself just then.</p>

<p>Lights and shadows came and went for a time. He could feel a
hand stroking through his hair and caressing his face. But for the
life of him he could not speak or open his eyes&mdash;could not
call Antoinette's name again, and he wanted to do that more than
anything else. The effort seemed to bring darkness about him once
more and when he came out of that darkness a second time his eyes
opened with the returning light and he found himself staring up to
find a log ceiling where there should have been tree tops and log
walls where there should have been the open wilderness with the
moaning tumult of rushing water whispering through it.</p>

<p>Then it came on him suddenly that he was in the girls' cabin at
Camp Number Two.</p>

<p>This was amazing and in the shock and unexpectedness of his
discovery he did not so much as move a finger.</p>

<p>There came a movement from the other side of the room, a sudden
quick breath close to him and Antoinette was on her knees at his
bedside. Seeing his eyes wide open and looking at her she gave a
little cry, and another came quickly across the room and stood over
him. This last was a little thin man with a shaven head and a face
that radiated immeasurable cheer. A puzzled look came into
Clifton's eyes as he recognized him. Why had Father Joseph come up
to Depot Number Two from the monastery at Mistassini? A bit of
illuminating truth began suddenly to possess him. Father Joseph was
a graduate of a surgical college. It meant&mdash;</p>

<p>Antoinette saw him struggling to understand, and then with
Father Joseph smiling on them she pressed her face down so closely
that for a few moments Clifton could feel only the sweet smother of
her hair and the warm thrill of her lips and cheek. When she raised
her head her face was radiant in its happiness and as infinitely
tender as an angel's.</p>

<p>"The logs hurt you," she said, "and we telephoned to the
monastery for Father Joseph, and he came quickly. And now you are
well again, Clifton, and mine&mdash;<i>all mine</i>. And, oh, I do
thank our dear Mother in Heaven and will never forget to thank Her
every day of my life so long as I live!"</p>

<p>Her shining eyes were filling with tears, and slowly she drew
away from him and Father Joseph took her place at his side. The
door from the room was behind him and he could hear Antoinette when
she went out and closed it softly.</p>

<p>Father Joseph was counting his pulse, and then ran a hand over
his right side, where he was beginning to feel a dull pain.</p>

<p>And then the tongue which had lain helpless in Clifton's mouth
came to life.</p>

<p>"What time is it, Father?"</p>

<p>"About four o'clock in the afternoon, my son."</p>

<p>"And the jam went out this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, this morning."</p>

<p>"And it was&mdash;a success?"</p>

<p>A humorous twinkle filled the monk's eyes. "Very successful, my
son, if I can believe the remarkable story which your wife has told
me."</p>

<p>"<i>My wife?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, the beautiful young woman who left your side just now, and
who&mdash;until my arrival at eleven o'clock this morning&mdash;was
Mademoiselle St. Ives. Did you not hear her when she said '<i>You
are mine&mdash;all mine</i>'?"</p>

<p>Clifton lay as if stunned by a blow, staring at the priest. And
Father Joseph had straightened himself and was rubbing his hands
and smiling.</p>

<p>"It was perhaps an unforgivable thing for me to do," he
explained, with an almost joyous exultation in his voice, "for at
no time have you really been in danger. The logs pounded you and
you lost consciousness at the last, but since then your condition
has been due almost entirely to extreme exhaustion and not to
injury, though I think you have a fractured rib or two that it will
take a little time to mend.</p>

<p>"But I could not make Mademoiselle Antoinette believe that. She
thought you might die, and when we two were alone in this room she
told me the story I have referred to, and said that never again
would she believe in God or the Church or Heaven unless I made you
man and wife, even though you could not lift a finger in protest;
and when I told her of the impossibility of it she called in two
other amazing creatures of similar beauty and insistence, and the
three of them compelled me almost by force to do a thing which, I
must confess, holds a most holy sentimental value but which cannot
bind you legally if you care to object&mdash;though I know that
Mademoiselle Antoinette would have lived to the letter and the
spirit of that act through all the years of her life had you
died.</p>

<p>"That was her fear&mdash;that you might die before she could
call herself your wife." Suddenly the humor and light went out of
the priest's eyes and face and left a softer radiance in their
place. "I have known Antoinette St. Ives for many years, my son,"
he added. "Our Mother in Heaven loves her, else I would not have
done this thing&mdash;and I pray that God's blessing will come here
and eternally to you both," and for the space of a moment or two he
bowed his head in prayer.</p>

<p>Clifton raised himself, speechless, and the priest laid a hand
gently on his head. They could hear footsteps and low voices
outside the cabin door.</p>

<p>"Only we five know of it," he confided softly, "and if you are
displeased at what has happened&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are&mdash;telling me the truth?" gasped Clifton. "It
isn't&mdash;something monstrous&mdash;a joke&mdash;a
<i>lie</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Would I destroy myself, my son?"</p>

<p>"And she is&mdash;<i>my wife</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if it is so you desire our act to be taken."</p>

<p>"Then God has been good to me," breathed Clifton, sinking back.
"I thank you, Father. And if you will let her come to me
now&mdash;<i>my wife</i>&mdash;" His voice was trembling like a
boy's.</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;probably&mdash;she is outside the door."</p>

<p>The monk moved away, but before he went he took his cowl and
robe from a chair near the bedside. The door opened and closed. And
a few moments later it opened again, so very softly that Clifton
scarce could hear it, and it closed even more softly, and there
came the thrilling click of a lock and footsteps that were like a
fairy's.</p>

<p>And then Antoinette stood in the light of the sun that came
through the western window, only a step away from him, but
hesitating for a moment as they looked into each other's
eyes&mdash;and Clifton reached out his arms, powerless to utter the
two precious words which he had meant to come first from his lips,
and Antoinette came into his arms, and put her head on his breast
and cried there in her happiness&mdash;yet in that happiness, it
seemed to Clifton, was something of grief far back.</p>

<p>He learned what it was in the early dusk of evening. Antoinette
was gone. John Denis had taken her place.</p>

<p>"Father Joseph says you will be up and moving about on your feet
tomorrow, Clifton. If anything had happened to you, old
man&mdash;to you or Antoinette&mdash;only God knows what I would
have done! Even as it is we have paid too great a price."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;Bolduc&mdash;died."</p>

<p>"Yes. The timber went down. We have beaten the Hurd-Foy crowd.
But Delphis went with it."</p>

<p>For a little space they were silent. It seemed to Clifton that
Denis had not spoken all that was in his mind.</p>

<p>"I liked Delphis," said Clifton then. "I liked him more than
most men. And it seems&mdash;to me&mdash;that Hurd is going to have
another debt to pay."</p>

<p>"He has paid," said John Denis quietly.</p>

<p>Their eyes met in a level gaze.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When you and Antoinette went under with the logs Alphonse the
monk was like a maniac, and ran laughing and screaming into the
forest. He returned to Ivan Hurd. Later I was called to witness
what had happened. It was in Hurd's room, and must have been
terrible. Alphonse had a knife and Hurd, his naked hands and
whatever else he could get hold of. He was literally slashed to
pieces and the other beaten to pieces. Both were dead. But Alphonse
must have died last for I found gripped tightly in his hand
something which could not possibly have been there during the
struggle. A curl of brown hair&mdash;very much
like&mdash;Antoinette's. I closed his hand more tightly about it,
Clifton. It will go with him into his grave."</p>

<p>Clifton had placed a hand over his eyes.</p>

<p>"I shall tell Antoinette&mdash;some day," he said. "I want her
to know. She has learned about the monk's death, and Hurd's?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The tragedy is common news in both camps. We are taking
Alphonse back to Depot Number One and will bury him in the edge of
the forest near the monastery. Antoinette and Gaspard have selected
the place, where years ago Alphonse saved Antoinette from death in
the river. They will accompany the body in the morning."</p>

<p>"And I shall go, too," said Clifton. "I can ride if I cannot
walk, John."</p>

<p>It was in the deeper dusk of evening that Clifton sat alone,
bolstered high up in his bed. And it was in this dusk that
Antoinette came to him again, and sat beside him, and placed her
head so that he could press his lips in her hair and kiss her when
she raised her face a little. And in this dusk sorrow and happiness
became one between them, and precious secrets crept out of their
hearts, and hope and glory and God grew about them as the stars
came out in the sky and the benediction of night closed about the
little cabin in the wilderness.</p>
