<h1>The Railway Children</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h1>E Nesbit</h1>

<hr align="center" width="50%">

<p style="text-align:center"><b>TO<br>
My dear son Paul Bland,<br>
behind whose knowledge of railways<br>
my ignorance confidently shelters.</b>
</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">

<h2>Chapter I. The beginning of things.</h2>

<p>They were not railway children to begin with. I don't suppose
they had ever thought about railways except as a means of getting
to Maskelyne and Cook's, the Pantomime, Zoological Gardens, and
Madame Tussaud's. They were just ordinary suburban children, and
they lived with their Father and Mother in an ordinary
red-brick-fronted villa, with coloured glass in the front door, a
tiled passage that was called a hall, a bath-room with hot and cold
water, electric bells, French windows, and a good deal of white
paint, and 'every modern convenience', as the house-agents say.</p>

<p>There were three of them. Roberta was the eldest. Of course,
Mothers never have favourites, but if their Mother <i>had</i> had a
favourite, it might have been Roberta. Next came Peter, who wished
to be an Engineer when he grew up; and the youngest was Phyllis,
who meant extremely well.</p>

<p>Mother did not spend all her time in paying dull calls to dull
ladies, and sitting dully at home waiting for dull ladies to pay
calls to her. She was almost always there, ready to play with the
children, and read to them, and help them to do their home-lessons.
Besides this she used to write stories for them while they were at
school, and read them aloud after tea, and she always made up funny
pieces of poetry for their birthdays and for other great occasions,
such as the christening of the new kittens, or the refurnishing of
the doll's house, or the time when they were getting over the
mumps.</p>

<p>These three lucky children always had everything they needed:
pretty clothes, good fires, a lovely nursery with heaps of toys,
and a Mother Goose wall-paper. They had a kind and merry nursemaid,
and a dog who was called James, and who was their very own. They
also had a Father who was just perfect&mdash;never cross, never
unjust, and always ready for a game&mdash;at least, if at any time
he was <i>not</i> ready, he always had an excellent reason for it,
and explained the reason to the children so interestingly and
funnily that they felt sure he couldn't help himself.</p>

<p>You will think that they ought to have been very happy. And so
they were, but they did not know <i>how</i> happy till the pretty
life in the Red Villa was over and done with, and they had to live
a very different life indeed.</p>

<p>The dreadful change came quite suddenly.</p>

<p>Peter had a birthday&mdash;his tenth. Among his other presents
was a model engine more perfect than you could ever have dreamed
of. The other presents were full of charm, but the Engine was
fuller of charm than any of the others were.</p>

<p>Its charm lasted in its full perfection for exactly three days.
Then, owing either to Peter's inexperience or Phyllis's good
intentions, which had been rather pressing, or to some other cause,
the Engine suddenly went off with a bang. James was so frightened
that he went out and did not come back all day. All the Noah's Ark
people who were in the tender were broken to bits, but nothing else
was hurt except the poor little engine and the feelings of Peter.
The others said he cried over it&mdash;but of course boys of ten do
not cry, however terrible the tragedies may be which darken their
lot. He said that his eyes were red because he had a cold. This
turned out to be true, though Peter did not know it was when he
said it, the next day he had to go to bed and stay there. Mother
began to be afraid that he might be sickening for measles, when
suddenly he sat up in bed and said:</p>

<p>"I hate gruel&mdash;I hate barley water&mdash;I hate bread and
milk. I want to get up and have something <i>real</i> to eat."</p>

<p>"What would you like?" Mother asked.</p>

<p>"A pigeon-pie," said Peter, eagerly, "a large pigeon-pie. A very
large one."</p>

<p>So Mother asked the Cook to make a large pigeon-pie. The pie was
made. And when the pie was made, it was cooked. And when it was
cooked, Peter ate some of it. After that his cold was better.
Mother made a piece of poetry to amuse him while the pie was being
made. It began by saying what an unfortunate but worthy boy Peter
was, then it went on:</p>

<blockquote>He had an engine that he loved<br>
With all his heart and soul,<br>
And if he had a wish on earth<br>
It was to keep it whole.<br>
<br>
One day&mdash;my friends, prepare your minds;<br>
I'm coming to the worst&mdash;<br>
Quite suddenly a screw went mad,<br>
And then the boiler burst!<br>
<br>
With gloomy face he picked it up<br>
And took it to his Mother,<br>
Though even he could not suppose<br>
That she could make another;<br>
<br>
For those who perished on the line<br>
He did not seem to care,<br>
His engine being more to him<br>
Than all the people there.<br>
<br>
And now you see the reason why<br>
Our Peter has been ill:<br>
He soothes his soul with pigeon-pie<br>
His gnawing grief to kill.<br>
<br>
He wraps himself in blankets warm<br>
And sleeps in bed till late,<br>
Determined thus to overcome<br>
His miserable fate.<br>
<br>
And if his eyes are rather red,<br>
His cold must just excuse it:<br>
Offer him pie; you may be sure<br>
He never will refuse it.</blockquote>

<p>Father had been away in the country for three or four days. All
Peter's hopes for the curing of his afflicted Engine were now fixed
on his Father, for Father was most wonderfully clever with his
fingers. He could mend all sorts of things. He had often acted as
veterinary surgeon to the wooden rocking-horse; once he had saved
its life when all human aid was despaired of, and the poor creature
was given up for lost, and even the carpenter said he didn't see
his way to do anything. And it was Father who mended the doll's
cradle when no one else could; and with a little glue and some bits
of wood and a pen-knife made all the Noah's Ark beasts as strong on
their pins as ever they were, if not stronger.</p>

<p>Peter, with heroic unselfishness, did not say anything about his
Engine till after Father had had his dinner and his after-dinner
cigar. The unselfishness was Mother's idea&mdash;but it was Peter
who carried it out. And needed a good deal of patience, too.</p>

<p>At last Mother said to Father, "Now, dear, if you're quite
rested, and quite comfy, we want to tell you about the great
railway accident, and ask your advice."</p>

<p>"All right," said Father, "fire away!"</p>

<p>So then Peter told the sad tale, and fetched what was left of
the Engine.</p>

<p>"Hum," said Father, when he had looked the Engine over very
carefully.</p>

<p>The children held their breaths.</p>

<p>"Is there <i>no</i> hope?" said Peter, in a low, unsteady
voice.</p>

<p>"Hope? Rather! Tons of it," said Father, cheerfully; "but it'll
want something besides hope&mdash;a bit of brazing say, or some
solder, and a new valve. I think we'd better keep it for a rainy
day. In other words, I'll give up Saturday afternoon to it, and you
shall all help me."</p>

<p>"<i>Can</i> girls help to mend engines?" Peter asked
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Of course they can. Girls are just as clever as boys, and don't
you forget it! How would you like to be an engine-driver,
Phil?"</p>

<p>"My face would be always dirty, wouldn't it?" said Phyllis, in
unenthusiastic tones, "and I expect I should break something."</p>

<p>"I should just love it," said Roberta&mdash;"do you think I
could when I'm grown up, Daddy? Or even a stoker?"</p>

<p>"You mean a fireman," said Daddy, pulling and twisting at the
engine. "Well, if you still wish it, when you're grown up, we'll
see about making you a fire-woman. I remember when I was a
boy&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then there was a knock at the front door.</p>

<p>"Who on earth!" said Father. "An Englishman's house is his
castle, of course, but I do wish they built semi-detached villas
with moats and drawbridges."</p>

<p>Ruth&mdash;she was the parlour-maid and had red hair&mdash;came
in and said that two gentlemen wanted to see the master.</p>

<p>"I've shown them into the Library, Sir," said she.</p>

<p>"I expect it's the subscription to the Vicar's testimonial,"
said Mother, "or else it's the choir holiday fund. Get rid of them
quickly, dear. It does break up an evening so, and it's nearly the
children's bedtime."</p>

<p>But Father did not seem to be able to get rid of the gentlemen
at all quickly.</p>

<p>"I wish we <i>had</i> got a moat and drawbridge," said Roberta;
"then, when we didn't want people, we could just pull up the
drawbridge and no one else could get in. I expect Father will have
forgotten about when he was a boy if they stay much longer."</p>

<p>Mother tried to make the time pass by telling them a new fairy
story about a Princess with green eyes, but it was difficult
because they could hear the voices of Father and the gentlemen in
the Library, and Father's voice sounded louder and different to the
voice he generally used to people who came about testimonials and
holiday funds.</p>

<p>Then the Library bell rang, and everyone heaved a breath of
relief.</p>

<p>"They're going now," said Phyllis; "he's rung to have them shown
out."</p>

<p>But instead of showing anybody out, Ruth showed herself in, and
she looked queer, the children thought.</p>

<p>"Please'm," she said, "the Master wants you to just step into
the study. He looks like the dead, mum; I think he's had bad news.
You'd best prepare yourself for the worst, 'm&mdash;p'raps it's a
death in the family or a bank busted or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That'll do, Ruth," said Mother gently; "you can go."</p>

<p>Then Mother went into the Library. There was more talking. Then
the bell rang again, and Ruth fetched a cab. The children heard
boots go out and down the steps. The cab drove away, and the front
door shut. Then Mother came in. Her dear face was as white as her
lace collar, and her eyes looked very big and shining. Her mouth
looked like just a line of pale red&mdash;her lips were thin and
not their proper shape at all.</p>

<p>"It's bedtime," she said. "Ruth will put you to bed."</p>

<p>"But you promised we should sit up late tonight because Father's
come home," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"Father's been called away&mdash;on business," said Mother.
"Come, darlings, go at once."</p>

<p>They kissed her and went. Roberta lingered to give Mother an
extra hug and to whisper:</p>

<p>"It wasn't bad news, Mammy, was it? Is anyone
dead&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nobody's dead&mdash;no," said Mother, and she almost seemed to
push Roberta away. "I can't tell you anything tonight, my pet. Go,
dear, go <i>now</i>."</p>

<p>So Roberta went.</p>

<p>Ruth brushed the girls' hair and helped them to undress. (Mother
almost always did this herself.) When she had turned down the gas
and left them she found Peter, still dressed, waiting on the
stairs.</p>

<p>"I say, Ruth, what's up?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me no questions and I won't tell you no lies," the
red-headed Ruth replied. "You'll know soon enough."</p>

<p>Late that night Mother came up and kissed all three children as
they lay asleep. But Roberta was the only one whom the kiss woke,
and she lay mousey-still, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"If Mother doesn't want us to know she's been crying," she said
to herself as she heard through the dark the catching of her
Mother's breath, "we <i>won't</i> know it. That's all."</p>

<p>When they came down to breakfast the next morning, Mother had
already gone out.</p>

<p>"To London," Ruth said, and left them to their breakfast.</p>

<p>"There's something awful the matter," said Peter, breaking his
egg. "Ruth told me last night we should know soon enough."</p>

<p>"Did you <i>ask</i> her?" said Roberta, with scorn.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did!" said Peter, angrily. "If you could go to bed
without caring whether Mother was worried or not, I couldn't. So
there."</p>

<p>"I don't think we ought to ask the servants things Mother
doesn't tell us," said Roberta.</p>

<p>"That's right, Miss Goody-goody," said Peter, "preach away."</p>

<p>"I'M not goody," said Phyllis, "but I think Bobbie's right this
time."</p>

<p>"Of course. She always is. In her own opinion," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>don't</i>!" cried Roberta, putting down her egg-spoon;
"don't let's be horrid to each other. I'm sure some dire calamity
is happening. Don't let's make it worse!"</p>

<p>"Who began, I should like to know?" said Peter.</p>

<p>Roberta made an effort, and answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I did, I suppose, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Peter, triumphantly. But before he went to
school he thumped his sister between the shoulders and told her to
cheer up.</p>

<p>The children came home to one o'clock dinner, but Mother was not
there. And she was not there at tea-time.</p>

<p>It was nearly seven before she came in, looking so ill and tired
that the children felt they could not ask her any questions. She
sank into an arm-chair. Phyllis took the long pins out of her hat,
while Roberta took off her gloves, and Peter unfastened her
walking-shoes and fetched her soft velvety slippers for her.</p>

<p>When she had had a cup of tea, and Roberta had put
<i>eau-de-Cologne</i> on her poor head that ached, Mother
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, my darlings, I want to tell you something. Those men last
night did bring very bad news, and Father will be away for some
time. I am very worried about it, and I want you all to help me,
and not to make things harder for me."</p>

<p>"As if we would!" said Roberta, holding Mother's hand against
her face.</p>

<p>"You can help me very much," said Mother, "by being good and
happy and not quarrelling when I'm away"&mdash;Roberta and Peter
exchanged guilty glances&mdash;"for I shall have to be away a good
deal."</p>

<p>"We won't quarrel. Indeed we won't," said everybody. And meant
it, too.</p>

<p>"Then," Mother went on, "I want you not to ask me any questions
about this trouble; and not to ask anybody else any questions."</p>

<p>Peter cringed and shuffled his boots on the carpet.</p>

<p>"You'll promise this, too, won't you?" said Mother.</p>

<p>"I did ask Ruth," said Peter, suddenly. "I'm very sorry, but I
did."</p>

<p>"And what did she say?"</p>

<p>"She said I should know soon enough."</p>

<p>"It isn't necessary for you to know anything about it," said
Mother; "it's about business, and you never do understand business,
do you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Roberta; "is it something to do with Government?" For
Father was in a Government Office.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mother. "Now it's bed-time, my darlings. And don't
<i>you</i> worry. It'll all come right in the end."</p>

<p>"Then don't <i>you</i> worry either, Mother," said Phyllis, "and
we'll all be as good as gold."</p>

<p>Mother sighed and kissed them.</p>

<p>"We'll begin being good the first thing tomorrow morning," said
Peter, as they went upstairs.</p>

<p>"Why not <i>now</i>?" said Roberta.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be good <i>about</i> now, silly," said
Peter.</p>

<p>"We might begin to try to <i>feel</i> good," said Phyllis, "and
not call names."</p>

<p>"Who's calling names?" said Peter. "Bobbie knows right enough
that when I say 'silly', it's just the same as if I said
Bobbie."</p>

<p>"<i>Well</i>," said Roberta.</p>

<p>"No, I don't mean what you mean. I mean it's just a&mdash;what
is it Father calls it?&mdash;a germ of endearment! Good night."</p>

<p>The girls folded up their clothes with more than usual
neatness&mdash; which was the only way of being good that they
could think of.</p>

<p>"I say," said Phyllis, smoothing out her pinafore, "you used to
say it was so dull&mdash;nothing happening, like in books. Now
something <i>has</i> happened."</p>

<p>"I never wanted things to happen to make Mother unhappy," said
Roberta. "Everything's perfectly horrid."</p>

<p>Everything continued to be perfectly horrid for some weeks.</p>

<p>Mother was nearly always out. Meals were dull and dirty. The
between-maid was sent away, and Aunt Emma came on a visit. Aunt
Emma was much older than Mother. She was going abroad to be a
governess. She was very busy getting her clothes ready, and they
were very ugly, dingy clothes, and she had them always littering
about, and the sewing-machine seemed to whir&mdash;on and on all
day and most of the night. Aunt Emma believed in keeping children
in their proper places. And they more than returned the compliment.
Their idea of Aunt Emma's proper place was anywhere where they were
not. So they saw very little of her. They preferred the company of
the servants, who were more amusing. Cook, if in a good temper,
could sing comic songs, and the housemaid, if she happened not to
be offended with you, could imitate a hen that has laid an egg, a
bottle of champagne being opened, and could mew like two cats
fighting. The servants never told the children what the bad news
was that the gentlemen had brought to Father. But they kept hinting
that they could tell a great deal if they chose&mdash;and this was
not comfortable.</p>

<p>One day when Peter had made a booby trap over the bath-room
door, and it had acted beautifully as Ruth passed through, that
red-haired parlour-maid caught him and boxed his ears.</p>

<p>"You'll come to a bad end," she said furiously, "you nasty
little limb, you! If you don't mend your ways, you'll go where your
precious Father's gone, so I tell you straight!"</p>

<p>Roberta repeated this to her Mother, and next day Ruth was sent
away.</p>

<p>Then came the time when Mother came home and went to bed and
stayed there two days and the Doctor came, and the children crept
wretchedly about the house and wondered if the world was coming to
an end.</p>

<p>Mother came down one morning to breakfast, very pale and with
lines on her face that used not to be there. And she smiled, as
well as she could, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, my pets, everything is settled. We're going to leave this
house, and go and live in the country. Such a ducky dear little
white house. I know you'll love it."</p>

<p>A whirling week of packing followed&mdash;not just packing
clothes, like when you go to the seaside, but packing chairs and
tables, covering their tops with sacking and their legs with
straw.</p>

<p>All sorts of things were packed that you don't pack when you go
to the seaside. Crockery, blankets, candlesticks, carpets,
bedsteads, saucepans, and even fenders and fire-irons.</p>

<p>The house was like a furniture warehouse. I think the children
enjoyed it very much. Mother was very busy, but not too busy now to
talk to them, and read to them, and even to make a bit of poetry
for Phyllis to cheer her up when she fell down with a screwdriver
and ran it into her hand.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to pack this, Mother?" Roberta asked, pointing
to the beautiful cabinet inlaid with red turtleshell and brass.</p>

<p>"We can't take everything," said Mother.</p>

<p>"But we seem to be taking all the ugly things," said
Roberta.</p>

<p>"We're taking the useful ones," said Mother; "we've got to play
at being Poor for a bit, my chickabiddy."</p>

<p>When all the ugly useful things had been packed up and taken
away in a van by men in green-baize aprons, the two girls and
Mother and Aunt Emma slept in the two spare rooms where the
furniture was all pretty. All their beds had gone. A bed was made
up for Peter on the drawing-room sofa.</p>

<p>"I say, this is larks," he said, wriggling joyously, as Mother
tucked him up. "I do like moving! I wish we moved once a
month."</p>

<p>Mother laughed.</p>

<p>"I don't!" she said. "Good night, Peterkin."</p>

<p>As she turned away Roberta saw her face. She never forgot
it.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother," she whispered all to herself as she got into bed,
"how brave you are! How I love you! Fancy being brave enough to
laugh when you're feeling like <i>that</i>!"</p>

<p>Next day boxes were filled, and boxes and more boxes; and then
late in the afternoon a cab came to take them to the station.</p>

<p>Aunt Emma saw them off. They felt that <i>they</i> were seeing
<i>her</i> off, and they were glad of it.</p>

<p>"But, oh, those poor little foreign children that she's going to
governess!" whispered Phyllis. "I wouldn't be them for
anything!"</p>

<p>At first they enjoyed looking out of the window, but when it
grew dusk they grew sleepier and sleepier, and no one knew how long
they had been in the train when they were roused by Mother's
shaking them gently and saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wake up, dears. We're there."</p>

<p>They woke up, cold and melancholy, and stood shivering on the
draughty platform while the baggage was taken out of the train.
Then the engine, puffing and blowing, set to work again, and
dragged the train away. The children watched the tail-lights of the
guard's van disappear into the darkness.</p>

<p>This was the first train the children saw on that railway which
was in time to become so very dear to them. They did not guess then
how they would grow to love the railway, and how soon it would
become the centre of their new life, nor what wonders and changes
it would bring to them. They only shivered and sneezed and hoped
the walk to the new house would not be long. Peter's nose was
colder than he ever remembered it to have been before. Roberta's
hat was crooked, and the elastic seemed tighter than usual.
Phyllis's shoe-laces had come undone.</p>

<p>"Come," said Mother, "we've got to walk. There aren't any cabs
here."</p>

<p>The walk was dark and muddy. The children stumbled a little on
the rough road, and once Phyllis absently fell into a puddle, and
was picked up damp and unhappy. There were no gas-lamps on the
road, and the road was uphill. The cart went at a foot's pace, and
they followed the gritty crunch of its wheels. As their eyes got
used to the darkness, they could see the mound of boxes swaying
dimly in front of them.</p>

<p>A long gate had to be opened for the cart to pass through, and
after that the road seemed to go across fields&mdash;and now it
went down hill. Presently a great dark lumpish thing showed over to
the right.</p>

<p>"There's the house," said Mother. "I wonder why she's shut the
shutters."</p>

<p>"Who's <i>she</i>?" asked Roberta.</p>

<p>"The woman I engaged to clean the place, and put the furniture
straight and get supper."</p>

<p>There was a low wall, and trees inside.</p>

<p>"That's the garden," said Mother.</p>

<p>"It looks more like a dripping-pan full of black cabbages," said
Peter.</p>

<p>The cart went on along by the garden wall, and round to the back
of the house, and here it clattered into a cobble-stoned yard and
stopped at the back door.</p>

<p>There was no light in any of the windows.</p>

<p>Everyone hammered at the door, but no one came.</p>

<p>The man who drove the cart said he expected Mrs. Viney had gone
home.</p>

<p>"You see your train was that late," said he.</p>

<p>"But she's got the key," said Mother. "What are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll have left that under the doorstep," said the cart
man; "folks do hereabouts." He took the lantern off his cart and
stooped.</p>

<p>"Ay, here it is, right enough," he said.</p>

<p>He unlocked the door and went in and set his lantern on the
table.</p>

<p>"Got e'er a candle?" said he.</p>

<p>"I don't know where anything is." Mother spoke rather less
cheerfully than usual.</p>

<p>He struck a match. There was a candle on the table, and he
lighted it. By its thin little glimmer the children saw a large
bare kitchen with a stone floor. There were no curtains, no
hearth-rug. The kitchen table from home stood in the middle of the
room. The chairs were in one corner, and the pots, pans, brooms,
and crockery in another. There was no fire, and the black grate
showed cold, dead ashes.</p>

<p>As the cart man turned to go out after he had brought in the
boxes, there was a rustling, scampering sound that seemed to come
from inside the walls of the house.</p>

<p>"Oh, what's that?" cried the girls.</p>

<p>"It's only the rats," said the cart man. And he went away and
shut the door, and the sudden draught of it blew out the
candle.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," said Phyllis, "I wish we hadn't come!" and she
knocked a chair over.</p>

<p>"<i>Only</i> the rats!" said Peter, in the dark.</p>

<h2>Chapter II. Peter's coal-mine.</h2>

<p>"What fun!" said Mother, in the dark, feeling for the matches on
the table. "How frightened the poor mice were&mdash;I don't believe
they were rats at all."</p>

<p>She struck a match and relighted the candle and everyone looked
at each other by its winky, blinky light.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "you've often wanted something to happen and
now it has. This is quite an adventure, isn't it? I told Mrs. Viney
to get us some bread and butter, and meat and things, and to have
supper ready. I suppose she's laid it in the dining-room. So let's
go and see."</p>

<p>The dining-room opened out of the kitchen. It looked much darker
than the kitchen when they went in with the one candle. Because the
kitchen was whitewashed, but the dining-room was dark wood from
floor to ceiling, and across the ceiling there were heavy black
beams. There was a muddled maze of dusty furniture&mdash;the
breakfast-room furniture from the old home where they had lived all
their lives. It seemed a very long time ago, and a very long way
off.</p>

<p>There was the table certainly, and there were chairs, but there
was no supper.</p>

<p>"Let's look in the other rooms," said Mother; and they looked.
And in each room was the same kind of blundering half-arrangement
of furniture, and fire-irons and crockery, and all sorts of odd
things on the floor, but there was nothing to eat; even in the
pantry there were only a rusty cake-tin and a broken plate with
whitening mixed in it.</p>

<p>"What a horrid old woman!" said Mother; "she's just walked off
with the money and not got us anything to eat at all."</p>

<p>"Then shan't we have any supper at all?" asked Phyllis,
dismayed, stepping back on to a soap-dish that cracked
responsively.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Mother, "only it'll mean unpacking one of those
big cases that we put in the cellar. Phil, do mind where you're
walking to, there's a dear. Peter, hold the light."</p>

<p>The cellar door opened out of the kitchen. There were five
wooden steps leading down. It wasn't a proper cellar at all, the
children thought, because its ceiling went up as high as the
kitchen's. A bacon-rack hung under its ceiling. There was wood in
it, and coal. Also the big cases.</p>

<p>Peter held the candle, all on one side, while Mother tried to
open the great packing-case. It was very securely nailed down.</p>

<p>"Where's the hammer?" asked Peter.</p>

<p>"That's just it," said Mother. "I'm afraid it's inside the box.
But there's a coal-shovel&mdash;and there's the kitchen poker."</p>

<p>And with these she tried to get the case open.</p>

<p>"Let me do it," said Peter, thinking he could do it better
himself. Everyone thinks this when he sees another person stirring
a fire, or opening a box, or untying a knot in a bit of string.</p>

<p>"You'll hurt your hands, Mammy," said Roberta; "let me."</p>

<p>"I wish Father was here," said Phyllis; "he'd get it open in two
shakes. What are you kicking me for, Bobbie?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't," said Roberta.</p>

<p>Just then the first of the long nails in the packing-case began
to come out with a scrunch. Then a lath was raised and then
another, till all four stood up with the long nails in them shining
fiercely like iron teeth in the candle-light.</p>

<p>"Hooray!" said Mother; "here are some candles&mdash;the very
first thing! You girls go and light them. You'll find some saucers
and things. Just drop a little candle-grease in the saucer and
stick the candle upright in it."</p>

<p>"How many shall we light?"</p>

<p>"As many as ever you like," said Mother, gaily. "The great thing
is to be cheerful. Nobody can be cheerful in the dark except owls
and dormice."</p>

<p>So the girls lighted candles. The head of the first match flew
off and stuck to Phyllis's finger; but, as Roberta said, it was
only a little burn, and she might have had to be a Roman martyr and
be burned whole if she had happened to live in the days when those
things were fashionable.</p>

<p>Then, when the dining-room was lighted by fourteen candles,
Roberta fetched coal and wood and lighted a fire.</p>

<p>"It's very cold for May," she said, feeling what a grown-up
thing it was to say.</p>

<p>The fire-light and the candle-light made the dining-room look
very different, for now you could see that the dark walls were of
wood, carved here and there into little wreaths and loops.</p>

<p>The girls hastily 'tidied' the room, which meant putting the
chairs against the wall, and piling all the odds and ends into a
corner and partly hiding them with the big leather arm-chair that
Father used to sit in after dinner.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried Mother, coming in with a tray full of things.
"This is something like! I'll just get a tablecloth and
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>The tablecloth was in a box with a proper lock that was opened
with a key and not with a shovel, and when the cloth was spread on
the table, a real feast was laid out on it.</p>

<p>Everyone was very, very tired, but everyone cheered up at the
sight of the funny and delightful supper. There were biscuits, the
Marie and the plain kind, sardines, preserved ginger, cooking
raisins, and candied peel and marmalade.</p>

<p>"What a good thing Aunt Emma packed up all the odds and ends out
of the Store cupboard," said Mother. "Now, Phil, <i>don't</i> put
the marmalade spoon in among the sardines."</p>

<p>"No, I won't, Mother," said Phyllis, and put it down among the
Marie biscuits.</p>

<p>"Let's drink Aunt Emma's health," said Roberta, suddenly; "what
should we have done if she hadn't packed up these things? Here's to
Aunt Emma!"</p>

<p>And the toast was drunk in ginger wine and water, out of
willow-patterned tea-cups, because the glasses couldn't be
found.</p>

<p>They all felt that they had been a little hard on Aunt Emma. She
wasn't a nice cuddly person like Mother, but after all it was she
who had thought of packing up the odds and ends of things to
eat.</p>

<p>It was Aunt Emma, too, who had aired all the sheets ready; and
the men who had moved the furniture had put the bedsteads together,
so the beds were soon made.</p>

<p>"Good night, chickies," said Mother. "I'm sure there aren't any
rats. But I'll leave my door open, and then if a mouse comes, you
need only scream, and I'll come and tell it exactly what I think of
it."</p>

<p>Then she went to her own room. Roberta woke to hear the little
travelling clock chime two. It sounded like a church clock ever so
far away, she always thought. And she heard, too, Mother still
moving about in her room.</p>

<p>Next morning Roberta woke Phyllis by pulling her hair gently,
but quite enough for her purpose.</p>

<p>"Wassermarrer?" asked Phyllis, still almost wholly asleep.</p>

<p>"Wake up! wake up!" said Roberta. "We're in the new
house&mdash;don't you remember? No servants or anything. Let's get
up and begin to be useful. We'll just creep down mouse-quietly, and
have everything beautiful before Mother gets up. I've woke Peter.
He'll be dressed as soon as we are."</p>

<p>So they dressed quietly and quickly. Of course, there was no
water in their room, so when they got down they washed as much as
they thought was necessary under the spout of the pump in the yard.
One pumped and the other washed. It was splashy but
interesting.</p>

<p>"It's much more fun than basin washing," said Roberta. "How
sparkly the weeds are between the stones, and the moss on the
roof&mdash;oh, and the flowers!"</p>

<p>The roof of the back kitchen sloped down quite low. It was made
of thatch and it had moss on it, and house-leeks and stonecrop and
wallflowers, and even a clump of purple flag-flowers, at the far
corner.</p>

<p>"This is far, far, far and away prettier than Edgecombe Villa,"
said Phyllis. "I wonder what the garden's like."</p>

<p>"We mustn't think of the garden yet," said Roberta, with earnest
energy. "Let's go in and begin to work."</p>

<p>They lighted the fire and put the kettle on, and they arranged
the crockery for breakfast; they could not find all the right
things, but a glass ash-tray made an excellent salt-cellar, and a
newish baking-tin seemed as if it would do to put bread on, if they
had any.</p>

<p>When there seemed to be nothing more that they could do, they
went out again into the fresh bright morning.</p>

<p>"We'll go into the garden now," said Peter. But somehow they
couldn't find the garden. They went round the house and round the
house. The yard occupied the back, and across it were stables and
outbuildings. On the other three sides the house stood simply in a
field, without a yard of garden to divide it from the short smooth
turf. And yet they had certainly seen the garden wall the night
before.</p>

<p>It was a hilly country. Down below they could see the line of
the railway, and the black yawning mouth of a tunnel. The station
was out of sight. There was a great bridge with tall arches running
across one end of the valley.</p>

<p>"Never mind the garden," said Peter; "let's go down and look at
the railway. There might be trains passing."</p>

<p>"We can see them from here," said Roberta, slowly; "let's sit
down a bit."</p>

<p>So they all sat down on a great flat grey stone that had pushed
itself up out of the grass; it was one of many that lay about on
the hillside, and when Mother came out to look for them at eight
o'clock, she found them deeply asleep in a contented, sun-warmed
bunch.</p>

<p>They had made an excellent fire, and had set the kettle on it at
about half-past five. So that by eight the fire had been out for
some time, the water had all boiled away, and the bottom was burned
out of the kettle. Also they had not thought of washing the
crockery before they set the table.</p>

<p>"But it doesn't matter&mdash;the cups and saucers, I mean," said
Mother. "Because I've found another room&mdash;I'd quite forgotten
there was one. And it's magic! And I've boiled the water for tea in
a saucepan."</p>

<p>The forgotten room opened out of the kitchen. In the agitation
and half darkness the night before its door had been mistaken for a
cupboard's. It was a little square room, and on its table, all
nicely set out, was a joint of cold roast beef, with bread, butter,
cheese, and a pie.</p>

<p>"Pie for breakfast!" cried Peter; "how perfectly ripping!"</p>

<p>"It isn't pigeon-pie," said Mother; "it's only apple. Well, this
is the supper we ought to have had last night. And there was a note
from Mrs. Viney. Her son-in-law has broken his arm, and she had to
get home early. She's coming this morning at ten."</p>

<p>That was a wonderful breakfast. It is unusual to begin the day
with cold apple pie, but the children all said they would rather
have it than meat.</p>

<p>"You see it's more like dinner than breakfast to us," said
Peter, passing his plate for more, "because we were up so
early."</p>

<p>The day passed in helping Mother to unpack and arrange things.
Six small legs quite ached with running about while their owners
carried clothes and crockery and all sorts of things to their
proper places. It was not till quite late in the afternoon that
Mother said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There! That'll do for to-day. I'll lie down for an hour, so as
to be as fresh as a lark by supper-time."</p>

<p>Then they all looked at each other. Each of the three expressive
countenances expressed the same thought. That thought was double,
and consisted, like the bits of information in the Child's Guide to
Knowledge, of a question and an answer.</p>

<p>Q. Where shall we go?</p>

<p>A. To the railway.</p>

<p>So to the railway they went, and as soon as they started for the
railway they saw where the garden had hidden itself. It was right
behind the stables, and it had a high wall all round.</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind about the garden now!" cried Peter. "Mother told
me this morning where it was. It'll keep till to-morrow. Let's get
to the railway."</p>

<p>The way to the railway was all down hill over smooth, short turf
with here and there furze bushes and grey and yellow rocks sticking
out like candied peel from the top of a cake.</p>

<p>The way ended in a steep run and a wooden fence&mdash;and there
was the railway with the shining metals and the telegraph wires and
posts and signals.</p>

<p>They all climbed on to the top of the fence, and then suddenly
there was a rumbling sound that made them look along the line to
the right, where the dark mouth of a tunnel opened itself in the
face of a rocky cliff; next moment a train had rushed out of the
tunnel with a shriek and a snort, and had slid noisily past them.
They felt the rush of its passing, and the pebbles on the line
jumped and rattled under it as it went by.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Roberta, drawing a long breath; "it was like a great
dragon tearing by. Did you feel it fan us with its hot wings?"</p>

<p>"I suppose a dragon's lair might look very like that tunnel from
the outside," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>But Peter said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I never thought we should ever get as near to a train as this.
It's the most ripping sport!"</p>

<p>"Better than toy-engines, isn't it?" said Roberta.</p>

<p>(I am tired of calling Roberta by her name. I don't see why I
should. No one else did. Everyone else called her Bobbie, and I
don't see why I shouldn't.)</p>

<p>"I don't know; it's different," said Peter. "It seems so odd to
see <i>all</i> of a train. It's awfully tall, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"We've always seen them cut in half by platforms," said
Phyllis.</p>

<p>"I wonder if that train was going to London," Bobbie said.
"London's where Father is."</p>

<p>"Let's go down to the station and find out," said Peter.</p>

<p>So they went.</p>

<p>They walked along the edge of the line, and heard the telegraph
wires humming over their heads. When you are in the train, it seems
such a little way between post and post, and one after another the
posts seem to catch up the wires almost more quickly than you can
count them. But when you have to walk, the posts seem few and far
between.</p>

<p>But the children got to the station at last.</p>

<p>Never before had any of them been at a station, except for the
purpose of catching trains&mdash;or perhaps waiting for
them&mdash;and always with grown-ups in attendance, grown-ups who
were not themselves interested in stations, except as places from
which they wished to get away.</p>

<p>Never before had they passed close enough to a signal-box to be
able to notice the wires, and to hear the mysterious 'ping, ping,'
followed by the strong, firm clicking of machinery.</p>

<p>The very sleepers on which the rails lay were a delightful path
to travel by&mdash;just far enough apart to serve as the
stepping-stones in a game of foaming torrents hastily organised by
Bobbie.</p>

<p>Then to arrive at the station, not through the booking office,
but in a freebooting sort of way by the sloping end of the
platform. This in itself was joy.</p>

<p>Joy, too, it was to peep into the porters' room, where the lamps
are, and the Railway almanac on the wall, and one porter half
asleep behind a paper.</p>

<p>There were a great many crossing lines at the station; some of
them just ran into a yard and stopped short, as though they were
tired of business and meant to retire for good. Trucks stood on the
rails here, and on one side was a great heap of coal&mdash;not a
loose heap, such as you see in your coal cellar, but a sort of
solid building of coals with large square blocks of coal outside
used just as though they were bricks, and built up till the heap
looked like the picture of the Cities of the Plain in 'Bible
Stories for Infants.' There was a line of whitewash near the top of
the coaly wall.</p>

<p>When presently the Porter lounged out of his room at the
twice-repeated tingling thrill of a gong over the station door,
Peter said, "How do you do?" in his best manner, and hastened to
ask what the white mark was on the coal for.</p>

<p>"To mark how much coal there be," said the Porter, "so as we'll
know if anyone nicks it. So don't you go off with none in your
pockets, young gentleman!"</p>

<p>This seemed, at the time but a merry jest, and Peter felt at
once that the Porter was a friendly sort with no nonsense about
him. But later the words came back to Peter with a new meaning.</p>

<p>Have you ever gone into a farmhouse kitchen on a baking day, and
seen the great crock of dough set by the fire to rise? If you have,
and if you were at that time still young enough to be interested in
everything you saw, you will remember that you found yourself quite
unable to resist the temptation to poke your finger into the soft
round of dough that curved inside the pan like a giant mushroom.
And you will remember that your finger made a dent in the dough,
and that slowly, but quite surely, the dent disappeared, and the
dough looked quite the same as it did before you touched it.
Unless, of course, your hand was extra dirty, in which case,
naturally, there would be a little black mark.</p>

<p>Well, it was just like that with the sorrow the children had
felt at Father's going away, and at Mother's being so unhappy. It
made a deep impression, but the impression did not last long.</p>

<p>They soon got used to being without Father, though they did not
forget him; and they got used to not going to school, and to seeing
very little of Mother, who was now almost all day shut up in her
upstairs room writing, writing, writing. She used to come down at
tea-time and read aloud the stories she had written. They were
lovely stories.</p>

<p>The rocks and hills and valleys and trees, the canal, and above
all, the railway, were so new and so perfectly pleasing that the
remembrance of the old life in the villa grew to seem almost like a
dream.</p>

<p>Mother had told them more than once that they were 'quite poor
now,' but this did not seem to be anything but a way of speaking.
Grown-up people, even Mothers, often make remarks that don't seem
to mean anything in particular, just for the sake of saying
something, seemingly. There was always enough to eat, and they wore
the same kind of nice clothes they had always worn.</p>

<p>But in June came three wet days; the rain came down, straight as
lances, and it was very, very cold. Nobody could go out, and
everybody shivered. They all went up to the door of Mother's room
and knocked.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" asked Mother from inside.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Bobbie, "mayn't I light a fire? I do know
how."</p>

<p>And Mother said: "No, my ducky-love. We mustn't have fires in
June&mdash;coal is so dear. If you're cold, go and have a good romp
in the attic. That'll warm you."</p>

<p>"But, Mother, it only takes such a very little coal to make a
fire."</p>

<p>"It's more than we can afford, chickeny-love," said Mother,
cheerfully. "Now run away, there's darlings&mdash;I'm madly
busy!"</p>

<p>"Mother's always busy now," said Phyllis, in a whisper to Peter.
Peter did not answer. He shrugged his shoulders. He was
thinking.</p>

<p>Thought, however, could not long keep itself from the suitable
furnishing of a bandit's lair in the attic. Peter was the bandit,
of course. Bobbie was his lieutenant, his band of trusty robbers,
and, in due course, the parent of Phyllis, who was the captured
maiden for whom a magnificent ransom&mdash;in horse-beans&mdash;was
unhesitatingly paid.</p>

<p>They all went down to tea flushed and joyous as any mountain
brigands.</p>

<p>But when Phyllis was going to add jam to her bread and butter,
Mother said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jam <i>or</i> butter, dear&mdash;not jam <i>and</i> butter. We
can't afford that sort of reckless luxury nowadays."</p>

<p>Phyllis finished the slice of bread and butter in silence, and
followed it up by bread and jam. Peter mingled thought and weak
tea.</p>

<p>After tea they went back to the attic and he said to his
sisters:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have an idea."</p>

<p>"What's that?" they asked politely.</p>

<p>"I shan't tell you," was Peter's unexpected rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," said Bobbie; and Phil said, "Don't, then."</p>

<p>"Girls," said Peter, "are always so hasty tempered."</p>

<p>"I should like to know what boys are?" said Bobbie, with fine
disdain. "I don't want to know about your silly ideas."</p>

<p>"You'll know some day," said Peter, keeping his own temper by
what looked exactly like a miracle; "if you hadn't been so keen on
a row, I might have told you about it being only noble-heartedness
that made me not tell you my idea. But now I shan't tell you
anything at all about it&mdash;so there!"</p>

<p>And it was, indeed, some time before he could be induced to say
anything, and when he did it wasn't much. He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The only reason why I won't tell you my idea that I'm going to
do is because it <i>may</i> be wrong, and I don't want to drag you
into it."</p>

<p>"Don't you do it if it's wrong, Peter," said Bobbie; "let me do
it." But Phyllis said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> should like to do wrong if <i>you're</i> going
to!"</p>

<p>"No," said Peter, rather touched by this devotion; "it's a
forlorn hope, and I'm going to lead it. All I ask is that if Mother
asks where I am, you won't blab."</p>

<p>"We haven't got anything <i>to</i> blab," said Bobbie,
indignantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you have!" said Peter, dropping horse-beans through
his fingers. "I've trusted you to the death. You know I'm going to
do a lone adventure&mdash;and some people might think it
wrong&mdash;I don't. And if Mother asks where I am, say I'm playing
at mines."</p>

<p>"What sort of mines?"</p>

<p>"You just say mines."</p>

<p>"You might tell <i>us</i>, Pete."</p>

<p>"Well, then, <i>coal</i>-mines. But don't you let the word pass
your lips on pain of torture."</p>

<p>"You needn't threaten," said Bobbie, "and I do think you might
let us help."</p>

<p>"If I find a coal-mine, you shall help cart the coal," Peter
condescended to promise.</p>

<p>"Keep your secret if you like," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"Keep it if you <i>can</i>," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"I'll keep it, right enough," said Peter.</p>

<p>Between tea and supper there is an interval even in the most
greedily regulated families. At this time Mother was usually
writing, and Mrs. Viney had gone home.</p>

<p>Two nights after the dawning of Peter's idea he beckoned the
girls mysteriously at the twilight hour.</p>

<p>"Come hither with me," he said, "and bring the Roman
Chariot."</p>

<p>The Roman Chariot was a very old perambulator that had spent
years of retirement in the loft over the coach-house. The children
had oiled its works till it glided noiseless as a pneumatic
bicycle, and answered to the helm as it had probably done in its
best days.</p>

<p>"Follow your dauntless leader," said Peter, and led the way down
the hill towards the station.</p>

<p>Just above the station many rocks have pushed their heads out
through the turf as though they, like the children, were interested
in the railway.</p>

<p>In a little hollow between three rocks lay a heap of dried
brambles and heather.</p>

<p>Peter halted, turned over the brushwood with a well-scarred
boot, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here's the first coal from the St. Peter's Mine. We'll take it
home in the chariot. Punctuality and despatch. All orders carefully
attended to. Any shaped lump cut to suit regular customers."</p>

<p>The chariot was packed full of coal. And when it was packed it
had to be unpacked again because it was so heavy that it couldn't
be got up the hill by the three children, not even when Peter
harnessed himself to the handle with his braces, and firmly
grasping his waistband in one hand pulled while the girls pushed
behind.</p>

<p>Three journeys had to be made before the coal from Peter's mine
was added to the heap of Mother's coal in the cellar.</p>

<p>Afterwards Peter went out alone, and came back very black and
mysterious.</p>

<p>"I've been to my coal-mine," he said; "to-morrow evening we'll
bring home the black diamonds in the chariot."</p>

<p>It was a week later that Mrs. Viney remarked to Mother how well
this last lot of coal was holding out.</p>

<p>The children hugged themselves and each other in complicated
wriggles of silent laughter as they listened on the stairs. They
had all forgotten by now that there had ever been any doubt in
Peter's mind as to whether coal-mining was wrong.</p>

<p>But there came a dreadful night when the Station Master put on a
pair of old sand shoes that he had worn at the seaside in his
summer holiday, and crept out very quietly to the yard where the
Sodom and Gomorrah heap of coal was, with the whitewashed line
round it. He crept out there, and he waited like a cat by a
mousehole. On the top of the heap something small and dark was
scrabbling and rattling furtively among the coal.</p>

<p>The Station Master concealed himself in the shadow of a
brake-van that had a little tin chimney and was
labelled:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>G. N. and S. R.<br>
34576<br>
Return at once to<br>
White Heather Sidings</blockquote>

<p>and in this concealment he lurked till the small thing on the
top of the heap ceased to scrabble and rattle, came to the edge of
the heap, cautiously let itself down, and lifted something after
it. Then the arm of the Station Master was raised, the hand of the
Station Master fell on a collar, and there was Peter firmly held by
the jacket, with an old carpenter's bag full of coal in his
trembling clutch.</p>

<p>"So I've caught you at last, have I, you young thief?" said the
Station Master.</p>

<p>"I'm not a thief," said Peter, as firmly as he could. "I'm a
coal-miner."</p>

<p>"Tell that to the Marines," said the Station Master.</p>

<p>"It would be just as true whoever I told it to," said Peter.</p>

<p>"You're right there," said the man, who held him. "Stow your
jaw, you young rip, and come along to the station."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," cried in the darkness an agonised voice that was not
Peter's.</p>

<p>"Not the <i>police</i> station!" said another voice from the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Not yet," said the Station Master. "The Railway Station first.
Why, it's a regular gang. Any more of you?"</p>

<p>"Only us," said Bobbie and Phyllis, coming out of the shadow of
another truck labelled Staveley Colliery, and bearing on it the
legend in white chalk: 'Wanted in No. 1 Road.'</p>

<p>"What do you mean by spying on a fellow like this?" said Peter,
angrily.</p>

<p>"Time someone did spy on you, <i>I</i> think," said the Station
Master. "Come along to the station."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>don't</i>!" said Bobbie. "Can't you decide <i>now</i>
what you'll do to us? It's our fault just as much as Peter's. We
helped to carry the coal away&mdash;and we knew where he got
it."</p>

<p>"No, you didn't," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Yes, we did," said Bobbie. "We knew all the time. We only
pretended we didn't just to humour you."</p>

<p>Peter's cup was full. He had mined for coal, he had struck coal,
he had been caught, and now he learned that his sisters had
'humoured' him.</p>

<p>"Don't hold me!" he said. "I won't run away."</p>

<p>The Station Master loosed Peter's collar, struck a match and
looked at them by its flickering light.</p>

<p>"Why," said he, "you're the children from the Three Chimneys up
yonder. So nicely dressed, too. Tell me now, what made you do such
a thing? Haven't you ever been to church or learned your catechism
or anything, not to know it's wicked to steal?" He spoke much more
gently now, and Peter said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I didn't think it was stealing. I was almost sure it wasn't. I
thought if I took it from the outside part of the heap, perhaps it
would be. But in the middle I thought I could fairly count it only
mining. It'll take thousands of years for you to burn up all that
coal and get to the middle parts."</p>

<p>"Not quite. But did you do it for a lark or what?"</p>

<p>"Not much lark carting that beastly heavy stuff up the hill,"
said Peter, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Then why did you?" The Station Master's voice was so much
kinder now that Peter replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You know that wet day? Well, Mother said we were too poor to
have a fire. We always had fires when it was cold at our other
house, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Don't</i>!" interrupted Bobbie, in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Station Master, rubbing his chin thoughtfully,
"I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll look over it this once. But you
remember, young gentleman, stealing is stealing, and what's mine
isn't yours, whether you call it mining or whether you don't. Run
along home."</p>

<p>"Do you mean you aren't going to do anything to us? Well, you
are a brick," said Peter, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"You're a dear," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"You're a darling," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said the Station Master.</p>

<p>And on this they parted.</p>

<p>"Don't speak to me," said Peter, as the three went up the hill.
"You're spies and traitors&mdash;that's what you are."</p>

<p>But the girls were too glad to have Peter between them, safe and
free, and on the way to Three Chimneys and not to the Police
Station, to mind much what he said.</p>

<p>"We <i>did</i> say it was us as much as you," said Bobbie,
gently.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and it wasn't."</p>

<p>"It would have come to the same thing in Courts with judges,"
said Phyllis. "Don't be snarky, Peter. It isn't our fault your
secrets are so jolly easy to find out." She took his arm, and he
let her.</p>

<p>"There's an awful lot of coal in the cellar, anyhow," he went
on.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't!" said Bobbie. "I don't think we ought to be glad
about <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Peter, plucking up a spirit. "I'm not at
all sure, even now, that mining is a crime."</p>

<p>But the girls were quite sure. And they were also quite sure
that he was quite sure, however little he cared to own it.</p>

<h2>Chapter III. The old gentleman.</h2>

<p>After the adventure of Peter's Coal-mine, it seemed well to the
children to keep away from the station&mdash;but they did not, they
could not, keep away from the railway. They had lived all their
lives in a street where cabs and omnibuses rumbled by at all hours,
and the carts of butchers and bakers and candlestick makers (I
never saw a candlestick-maker's cart; did you?) might occur at any
moment. Here in the deep silence of the sleeping country the only
things that went by were the trains. They seemed to be all that was
left to link the children to the old life that had once been
theirs. Straight down the hill in front of Three Chimneys the daily
passage of their six feet began to mark a path across the crisp,
short turf. They began to know the hours when certain trains
passed, and they gave names to them. The 9.15 up was called the
Green Dragon. The 10.7 down was the Worm of Wantley. The midnight
town express, whose shrieking rush they sometimes woke from their
dreams to hear, was the Fearsome Fly-by-night. Peter got up once,
in chill starshine, and, peeping at it through his curtains, named
it on the spot.</p>

<p>It was by the Green Dragon that the old gentleman travelled. He
was a very nice-looking old gentleman, and he looked as if he were
nice, too, which is not at all the same thing. He had a
fresh-coloured, clean-shaven face and white hair, and he wore
rather odd-shaped collars and a top-hat that wasn't exactly the
same kind as other people's. Of course the children didn't see all
this at first. In fact the first thing they noticed about the old
gentleman was his hand.</p>

<p>It was one morning as they sat on the fence waiting for the
Green Dragon, which was three and a quarter minutes late by Peter's
Waterbury watch that he had had given him on his last birthday.</p>

<p>"The Green Dragon's going where Father is," said Phyllis; "if it
were a really real dragon, we could stop it and ask it to take our
love to Father."</p>

<p>"Dragons don't carry people's love," said Peter; "they'd be
above it."</p>

<p>"Yes, they do, if you tame them thoroughly first. They fetch and
carry like pet spaniels," said Phyllis, "and feed out of your hand.
I wonder why Father never writes to us."</p>

<p>"Mother says he's been too busy," said Bobbie; "but he'll write
soon, she says."</p>

<p>"I say," Phyllis suggested, "let's all wave to the Green Dragon
as it goes by. If it's a magic dragon, it'll understand and take
our loves to Father. And if it isn't, three waves aren't much. We
shall never miss them."</p>

<p>So when the Green Dragon tore shrieking out of the mouth of its
dark lair, which was the tunnel, all three children stood on the
railing and waved their pocket-handkerchiefs without stopping to
think whether they were clean handkerchiefs or the reverse. They
were, as a matter of fact, very much the reverse.</p>

<p>And out of a first-class carriage a hand waved back. A quite
clean hand. It held a newspaper. It was the old gentleman's
hand.</p>

<p>After this it became the custom for waves to be exchanged
between the children and the 9.15.</p>

<p>And the children, especially the girls, liked to think that
perhaps the old gentleman knew Father, and would meet him 'in
business,' wherever that shady retreat might be, and tell him how
his three children stood on a rail far away in the green country
and waved their love to him every morning, wet or fine.</p>

<p>For they were now able to go out in all sorts of weather such as
they would never have been allowed to go out in when they lived in
their villa house. This was Aunt Emma's doing, and the children
felt more and more that they had not been quite fair to this
unattractive aunt, when they found how useful were the long gaiters
and waterproof coats that they had laughed at her for buying for
them.</p>

<p>Mother, all this time, was very busy with her writing. She used
to send off a good many long blue envelopes with stories in
them&mdash;and large envelopes of different sizes and colours used
to come to her. Sometimes she would sigh when she opened them and
say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Another story come home to roost. Oh, dear, Oh, dear!" and then
the children would be very sorry.</p>

<p>But sometimes she would wave the envelope in the air and
say:&mdash; "Hooray, hooray. Here's a sensible Editor. He's taken
my story and this is the proof of it."</p>

<p>At first the children thought 'the Proof' meant the letter the
sensible Editor had written, but they presently got to know that
the proof was long slips of paper with the story printed on
them.</p>

<p>Whenever an Editor was sensible there were buns for tea.</p>

<p>One day Peter was going down to the village to get buns to
celebrate the sensibleness of the Editor of the Children's Globe,
when he met the Station Master.</p>

<p>Peter felt very uncomfortable, for he had now had time to think
over the affair of the coal-mine. He did not like to say "Good
morning" to the Station Master, as you usually do to anyone you
meet on a lonely road, because he had a hot feeling, which spread
even to his ears, that the Station Master might not care to speak
to a person who had stolen coals. 'Stolen' is a nasty word, but
Peter felt it was the right one. So he looked down, and said
Nothing.</p>

<p>It was the Station Master who said "Good morning" as he passed
by. And Peter answered, "Good morning." Then he thought:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps he doesn't know who I am by daylight, or he wouldn't be
so polite."</p>

<p>And he did not like the feeling which thinking this gave him.
And then before he knew what he was going to do he ran after the
Station Master, who stopped when he heard Peter's hasty boots
crunching the road, and coming up with him very breathless and with
his ears now quite magenta-coloured, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't want you to be polite to me if you don't know me when
you see me."</p>

<p>"Eh?" said the Station Master.</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps you didn't know it was me that took the
coals," Peter went on, "when you said 'Good morning.' But it was,
and I'm sorry. There."</p>

<p>"Why," said the Station Master, "I wasn't thinking anything at
all about the precious coals. Let bygones be bygones. And where
were you off to in such a hurry?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to buy buns for tea," said Peter.</p>

<p>"I thought you were all so poor," said the Station Master.</p>

<p>"So we are," said Peter, confidentially, "but we always have
three pennyworth of halfpennies for tea whenever Mother sells a
story or a poem or anything."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the Station Master, "so your Mother writes stories,
does she?"</p>

<p>"The beautifulest you ever read," said Peter.</p>

<p>"You ought to be very proud to have such a clever Mother."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter, "but she used to play with us more before she
had to be so clever."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Station Master, "I must be getting along. You
give us a look in at the Station whenever you feel so inclined. And
as to coals, it's a word that&mdash;well&mdash;oh, no, we never
mention it, eh?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Peter. "I'm very glad it's all straightened
out between us." And he went on across the canal bridge to the
village to get the buns, feeling more comfortable in his mind than
he had felt since the hand of the Station Master had fastened on
his collar that night among the coals.</p>

<p>Next day when they had sent the threefold wave of greeting to
Father by the Green Dragon, and the old gentleman had waved back as
usual, Peter proudly led the way to the station.</p>

<p>"But ought we?" said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"After the coals, she means," Phyllis explained.</p>

<p>"I met the Station Master yesterday," said Peter, in an offhand
way, and he pretended not to hear what Phyllis had said; "he
expresspecially invited us to go down any time we liked."</p>

<p>"After the coals?" repeated Phyllis. "Stop a minute&mdash;my
bootlace is undone again."</p>

<p>"It always <i>is</i> undone again," said Peter, "and the Station
Master was more of a gentleman than you'll ever be,
Phil&mdash;throwing coal at a chap's head like that."</p>

<p>Phyllis did up her bootlace and went on in silence, but her
shoulders shook, and presently a fat tear fell off her nose and
splashed on the metal of the railway line. Bobbie saw it.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter, darling?" she said, stopping short and
putting her arm round the heaving shoulders.</p>

<p>"He called me un-un-ungentlemanly," sobbed Phyllis. "I didn't
never call him unladylike, not even when he tied my Clorinda to the
firewood bundle and burned her at the stake for a martyr."</p>

<p>Peter had indeed perpetrated this outrage a year or two
before.</p>

<p>"Well, you began, you know," said Bobbie, honestly, "about coals
and all that. Don't you think you'd better both unsay everything
since the wave, and let honour be satisfied?"</p>

<p>"I will if Peter will," said Phyllis, sniffling.</p>

<p>"All right," said Peter; "honour is satisfied. Here, use my
hankie, Phil, for goodness' sake, if you've lost yours as usual. I
wonder what you do with them."</p>

<p>"You had my last one," said Phyllis, indignantly, "to tie up the
rabbit-hutch door with. But you're very ungrateful. It's quite
right what it says in the poetry book about sharper than a serpent
it is to have a toothless child&mdash;but it means ungrateful when
it says toothless. Miss Lowe told me so."</p>

<p>"All right," said Peter, impatiently, "I'm sorry. <i>There</i>!
Now will you come on?"</p>

<p>They reached the station and spent a joyous two hours with the
Porter. He was a worthy man and seemed never tired of answering the
questions that begin with "Why&mdash;" which many people in higher
ranks of life often seem weary of.</p>

<p>He told them many things that they had not known
before&mdash;as, for instance, that the things that hook carriages
together are called couplings, and that the pipes like great
serpents that hang over the couplings are meant to stop the train
with.</p>

<p>"If you could get a holt of one o' them when the train is going
and pull 'em apart," said he, "she'd stop dead off with a
jerk."</p>

<p>"Who's she?" said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"The train, of course," said the Porter. After that the train
was never again 'It' to the children.</p>

<p>"And you know the thing in the carriages where it says on it,
'Five pounds' fine for improper use.' If you was to improperly use
that, the train 'ud stop."</p>

<p>"And if you used it properly?" said Roberta.</p>

<p>"It 'ud stop just the same, I suppose," said he, "but it isn't
proper use unless you're being murdered. There was an old lady
once&mdash;someone kidded her on it was a refreshment-room bell,
and she used it improper, not being in danger of her life, though
hungry, and when the train stopped and the guard came along
expecting to find someone weltering in their last moments, she
says, 'Oh, please, Mister, I'll take a glass of stout and a bath
bun,' she says. And the train was seven minutes behind her time as
it was."</p>

<p>"What did the guard say to the old lady?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> dunno," replied the Porter, "but I lay she didn't
forget it in a hurry, whatever it was."</p>

<p>In such delightful conversation the time went by all too
quickly.</p>

<p>The Station Master came out once or twice from that sacred inner
temple behind the place where the hole is that they sell you
tickets through, and was most jolly with them all.</p>

<p>"Just as if coal had never been discovered," Phyllis whispered
to her sister.</p>

<p>He gave them each an orange, and promised to take them up into
the signal-box one of these days, when he wasn't so busy.</p>

<p>Several trains went through the station, and Peter noticed for
the first time that engines have numbers on them, like cabs.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Porter, "I knowed a young gent as used to take
down the numbers of every single one he seed; in a green note-book
with silver corners it was, owing to his father being very
well-to-do in the wholesale stationery."</p>

<p>Peter felt that he could take down numbers, too, even if he was
not the son of a wholesale stationer. As he did not happen to have
a green leather note-book with silver corners, the Porter gave him
a yellow envelope and on it he noted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>379<br>
663</blockquote>

<p>and felt that this was the beginning of what would be a most
interesting collection.</p>

<p>That night at tea he asked Mother if she had a green leather
note-book with silver corners. She had not; but when she heard what
he wanted it for she gave him a little black one.</p>

<p>"It has a few pages torn out," said she; "but it will hold quite
a lot of numbers, and when it's full I'll give you another. I'm so
glad you like the railway. Only, please, you mustn't walk on the
line."</p>

<p>"Not if we face the way the train's coming?" asked Peter, after
a gloomy pause, in which glances of despair were exchanged.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;really not," said Mother.</p>

<p>Then Phyllis said, "Mother, didn't <i>you</i> ever walk on the
railway lines when you were little?"</p>

<p>Mother was an honest and honourable Mother, so she had to say,
"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"But, darlings, you don't know how fond I am of you. What should
I do if you got hurt?"</p>

<p>"Are you fonder of us than Granny was of you when you were
little?" Phyllis asked. Bobbie made signs to her to stop, but
Phyllis never did see signs, no matter how plain they might be.</p>

<p>Mother did not answer for a minute. She got up to put more water
in the teapot.</p>

<p>"No one," she said at last, "ever loved anyone more than my
mother loved me."</p>

<p>Then she was quiet again, and Bobbie kicked Phyllis hard under
the table, because Bobbie understood a little bit the thoughts that
were making Mother so quiet&mdash;the thoughts of the time when
Mother was a little girl and was all the world to <i>her</i>
mother. It seems so easy and natural to run to Mother when one is
in trouble. Bobbie understood a little how people do not leave off
running to their mothers when they are in trouble even when they
are grown up, and she thought she knew a little what it must be to
be sad, and have no mother to run to any more.</p>

<p>So she kicked Phyllis, who said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What are you kicking me like that for, Bob?"</p>

<p>And then Mother laughed a little and sighed and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very well, then. Only let me be sure you do know which way the
trains come&mdash;and don't walk on the line near the tunnel or
near corners."</p>

<p>"Trains keep to the left like carriages," said Peter, "so if we
keep to the right, we're bound to see them coming."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mother, and I dare say you think that she
ought not to have said it. But she remembered about when she was a
little girl herself, and she did say it&mdash;and neither her own
children nor you nor any other children in the world could ever
understand exactly what it cost her to do it. Only some few of you,
like Bobbie, may understand a very little bit.</p>

<p>It was the very next day that Mother had to stay in bed because
her head ached so. Her hands were burning hot, and she would not
eat anything, and her throat was very sore.</p>

<p>"If I was you, Mum," said Mrs. Viney, "I should take and send
for the doctor. There's a lot of catchy complaints a-going about
just now. My sister's eldest&mdash;she took a chill and it went to
her inside, two years ago come Christmas, and she's never been the
same gell since."</p>

<p>Mother wouldn't at first, but in the evening she felt so much
worse that Peter was sent to the house in the village that had
three laburnum trees by the gate, and on the gate a brass plate
with W. W. Forrest, M.D., on it.</p>

<p>W. W. Forrest, M.D., came at once. He talked to Peter on the way
back. He seemed a most charming and sensible man, interested in
railways, and rabbits, and really important things.</p>

<p>When he had seen Mother, he said it was influenza.</p>

<p>"Now, Lady Grave-airs," he said in the hall to Bobbie, "I
suppose you'll want to be head-nurse."</p>

<p>"Of course," said she.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll send down some medicine. Keep up a good fire.
Have some strong beef tea made ready to give her as soon as the
fever goes down. She can have grapes now, and beef
essence&mdash;and soda-water and milk, and you'd better get in a
bottle of brandy. The best brandy. Cheap brandy is worse than
poison."</p>

<p>She asked him to write it all down, and he did.</p>

<p>When Bobbie showed Mother the list he had written, Mother
laughed. It <i>was</i> a laugh, Bobbie decided, though it was
rather odd and feeble.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Mother, laying in bed with eyes as bright as
beads. "I can't afford all that rubbish. Tell Mrs. Viney to boil
two pounds of scrag-end of the neck for your dinners to-morrow, and
I can have some of the broth. Yes, I should like some more water
now, love. And will you get a basin and sponge my hands?"</p>

<p>Roberta obeyed. When she had done everything she could to make
Mother less uncomfortable, she went down to the others. Her cheeks
were very red, her lips set tight, and her eyes almost as bright as
Mother's.</p>

<p>She told them what the Doctor had said, and what Mother had
said.</p>

<p>"And now," said she, when she had told all, "there's no one but
us to do anything, and we've got to do it. I've got the shilling
for the mutton."</p>

<p>"We can do without the beastly mutton," said Peter; "bread and
butter will support life. People have lived on less on desert
islands many a time."</p>

<p>"Of course," said his sister. And Mrs. Viney was sent to the
village to get as much brandy and soda-water and beef tea as she
could buy for a shilling.</p>

<p>"But even if we never have anything to eat at all," said
Phyllis, "you can't get all those other things with our dinner
money."</p>

<p>"No," said Bobbie, frowning, "we must find out some other way.
Now <i>think</i>, everybody, just as hard as ever you can."</p>

<p>They did think. And presently they talked. And later, when
Bobbie had gone up to sit with Mother in case she wanted anything,
the other two were very busy with scissors and a white sheet, and a
paint brush, and the pot of Brunswick black that Mrs. Viney used
for grates and fenders. They did not manage to do what they wished,
exactly, with the first sheet, so they took another out of the
linen cupboard. It did not occur to them that they were spoiling
good sheets which cost good money. They only knew that they were
making a good&mdash;but what they were making comes later.</p>

<p>Bobbie's bed had been moved into Mother's room, and several
times in the night she got up to mend the fire, and to give her
mother milk and soda-water. Mother talked to herself a good deal,
but it did not seem to mean anything. And once she woke up suddenly
and called out: "Mamma, mamma!" and Bobbie knew she was calling for
Granny, and that she had forgotten that it was no use calling,
because Granny was dead.</p>

<p>In the early morning Bobbie heard her name and jumped out of bed
and ran to Mother's bedside.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ah, yes&mdash;I think I was asleep," said Mother. "My
poor little duck, how tired you'll be&mdash;I do hate to give you
all this trouble."</p>

<p>"Trouble!" said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Ah, don't cry, sweet," Mother said; "I shall be all right in a
day or two."</p>

<p>And Bobbie said, "Yes," and tried to smile.</p>

<p>When you are used to ten hours of solid sleep, to get up three
or four times in your sleep-time makes you feel as though you had
been up all night. Bobbie felt quite stupid and her eyes were sore
and stiff, but she tidied the room, and arranged everything neatly
before the Doctor came.</p>

<p>This was at half-past eight.</p>

<p>"Everything going on all right, little Nurse?" he said at the
front door. "Did you get the brandy?"</p>

<p>"I've got the brandy," said Bobbie, "in a little flat
bottle."</p>

<p>"I didn't see the grapes or the beef tea, though," said he.</p>

<p>"No," said Bobbie, firmly, "but you will to-morrow. And there's
some beef stewing in the oven for beef tea."</p>

<p>"Who told you to do that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I noticed what Mother did when Phil had mumps."</p>

<p>"Right," said the Doctor. "Now you get your old woman to sit
with your mother, and then you eat a good breakfast, and go
straight to bed and sleep till dinner-time. We can't afford to have
the head-nurse ill."</p>

<p>He was really quite a nice doctor.</p>

<p>When the 9.15 came out of the tunnel that morning the old
gentleman in the first-class carriage put down his newspaper, and
got ready to wave his hand to the three children on the fence. But
this morning there were not three. There was only one. And that was
Peter.</p>

<p>Peter was not on the railings either, as usual. He was standing
in front of them in an attitude like that of a show-man showing off
the animals in a menagerie, or of the kind clergyman when he points
with a wand at the 'Scenes from Palestine,' when there is a
magic-lantern and he is explaining it.</p>

<p>Peter was pointing, too. And what he was pointing at was a large
white sheet nailed against the fence. On the sheet there were thick
black letters more than a foot long.</p>

<p>Some of them had run a little, because of Phyllis having put the
Brunswick black on too eagerly, but the words were quite easy to
read.</p>

<p>And this what the old gentleman and several other people in the
train read in the large black letters on the white
sheet:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>LOOK OUT AT THE STATION.</b>
</p>

<p>A good many people did look out at the station and were
disappointed, for they saw nothing unusual. The old gentleman
looked out, too, and at first he too saw nothing more unusual than
the gravelled platform and the sunshine and the wallflowers and
forget-me-nots in the station borders. It was only just as the
train was beginning to puff and pull itself together to start again
that he saw Phyllis. She was quite out of breath with running.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "I thought I'd missed you. My bootlaces would
keep coming down and I fell over them twice. Here, take it."</p>

<p>She thrust a warm, dampish letter into his hand as the train
moved.</p>

<p>He leaned back in his corner and opened the letter. This is what
he read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Dear Mr. We do not know your name.<br>
<br>
"Mother is ill and the doctor says to give her the things at the
end of the letter, but she says she can't aford it, and to get
mutton for us and she will have the broth. We do not know anybody
here but you, because Father is away and we do not know the
address. Father will pay you, or if he has lost all his money, or
anything, Peter will pay you when he is a man. We promise it on our
honer. I.O.U. for all the things Mother wants.<br>
<br>
"sined Peter.<br>
<br>
"Will you give the parsel to the Station Master, because of us not
knowing what train you come down by? Say it is for Peter that was
sorry about the coals and he will know all right.<br>
<br>
"Roberta.<br>
"Phyllis.<br>
"Peter."</blockquote>

<p>Then came the list of things the Doctor had ordered.</p>

<p>The old gentleman read it through once, and his eyebrows went
up. He read it twice and smiled a little. When he had read it
thrice, he put it in his pocket and went on reading The Times.</p>

<p>At about six that evening there was a knock at the back door.
The three children rushed to open it, and there stood the friendly
Porter, who had told them so many interesting things about
railways. He dumped down a big hamper on the kitchen flags.</p>

<p>"Old gent," he said; "he asked me to fetch it up straight
away."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said Peter, and then, as the Porter
lingered, he added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm most awfully sorry I haven't got twopence to give you like
Father does, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You drop it if you please," said the Porter, indignantly. "I
wasn't thinking about no tuppences. I only wanted to say I was
sorry your Mamma wasn't so well, and to ask how she finds herself
this evening&mdash;and I've fetched her along a bit of sweetbrier,
very sweet to smell it is. Twopence indeed," said he, and produced
a bunch of sweetbrier from his hat, "just like a conjurer," as
Phyllis remarked afterwards.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said Peter, "and I beg your pardon about
the twopence."</p>

<p>"No offence," said the Porter, untruly but politely, and
went.</p>

<p>Then the children undid the hamper. First there was straw, and
then there were fine shavings, and then came all the things they
had asked for, and plenty of them, and then a good many things they
had not asked for; among others peaches and port wine and two
chickens, a cardboard box of big red roses with long stalks, and a
tall thin green bottle of lavender water, and three smaller fatter
bottles of <i>eau-de-Cologne</i>. There was a letter, too.</p>

<p>"Dear Roberta and Phyllis and Peter," it said; "here are the
things you want. Your mother will want to know where they came
from. Tell her they were sent by a friend who heard she was ill.
When she is well again you must tell her all about it, of course.
And if she says you ought not to have asked for the things, tell
her that I say you were quite right, and that I hope she will
forgive me for taking the liberty of allowing myself a very great
pleasure."</p>

<p>The letter was signed G. P. something that the children couldn't
read.</p>

<p>"I think we <i>were</i> right," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"Right? Of course we were right," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"All the same," said Peter, with his hands in his pockets, "I
don't exactly look forward to telling Mother the whole truth about
it."</p>

<p>"We're not to do it till she's well," said Bobbie, "and when
she's well we shall be so happy we shan't mind a little fuss like
that. Oh, just look at the roses! I must take them up to her."</p>

<p>"And the sweetbrier," said Phyllis, sniffing it loudly; "don't
forget the sweetbrier."</p>

<p>"As if I should!" said Roberta. "Mother told me the other day
there was a thick hedge of it at her mother's house when she was a
little girl."</p>

<h2>Chapter IV. The engine-burglar.</h2>

<p>What was left of the second sheet and the Brunswick black came
in very nicely to make a banner bearing the legend:</p>

<p><b>SHE IS NEARLY WELL THANK YOU</b>
</p>

<p>and this was displayed to the Green Dragon about a fortnight
after the arrival of the wonderful hamper. The old gentleman saw
it, and waved a cheerful response from the train. And when this had
been done the children saw that now was the time when they must
tell Mother what they had done when she was ill. And it did not
seem nearly so easy as they had thought it would be. But it had to
be done. And it was done. Mother was extremely angry. She was
seldom angry, and now she was angrier than they had ever known her.
This was horrible. But it was much worse when she suddenly began to
cry. Crying is catching, I believe, like measles and
whooping-cough. At any rate, everyone at once found itself taking
part in a crying-party.</p>

<p>Mother stopped first. She dried her eyes and then she
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I was so angry, darlings, because I know you didn't
understand."</p>

<p>"We didn't mean to be naughty, Mammy," sobbed Bobbie, and Peter
and Phyllis sniffed.</p>

<p>"Now, listen," said Mother; "it's quite true that we're poor,
but we have enough to live on. You mustn't go telling everyone
about our affairs&mdash;it's not right. And you must never, never,
never ask strangers to give you things. Now always remember
that&mdash;won't you?"</p>

<p>They all hugged her and rubbed their damp cheeks against hers
and promised that they would.</p>

<p>"And I'll write a letter to your old gentleman, and I shall tell
him that I didn't approve&mdash;oh, of course I shall thank him,
too, for his kindness. It's <i>you</i> I don't approve of, my
darlings, not the old gentleman. He was as kind as ever he could
be. And you can give the letter to the Station Master to give
him&mdash;and we won't say any more about it."</p>

<p>Afterwards, when the children were alone, Bobbie
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Isn't Mother splendid? You catch any other grown-up saying they
were sorry they had been angry."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter, "she <i>is</i> splendid; but it's rather
awful when she's angry."</p>

<p>"She's like Avenging and Bright in the song," said Phyllis. "I
should like to look at her if it wasn't so awful. She looks so
beautiful when she's really downright furious."</p>

<p>They took the letter down to the Station Master.</p>

<p>"I thought you said you hadn't got any friends except in
London," said he.</p>

<p>"We've made him since," said Peter.</p>

<p>"But he doesn't live hereabouts?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;we just know him on the railway."</p>

<p>Then the Station Master retired to that sacred inner temple
behind the little window where the tickets are sold, and the
children went down to the Porters' room and talked to the Porter.
They learned several interesting things from him&mdash;among others
that his name was Perks, that he was married and had three
children, that the lamps in front of engines are called head-lights
and the ones at the back tail-lights.</p>

<p>"And that just shows," whispered Phyllis, "that trains really
<i>are</i> dragons in disguise, with proper heads and tails."</p>

<p>It was on this day that the children first noticed that all
engines are not alike.</p>

<p>"Alike?" said the Porter, whose name was Perks, "lor, love you,
no, Miss. No more alike nor what you an' me are. That little 'un
without a tender as went by just now all on her own, that was a
tank, that was&mdash;she's off to do some shunting t'other side o'
Maidbridge. That's as it might be you, Miss. Then there's goods
engines, great, strong things with three wheels each
side&mdash;joined with rods to strengthen 'em&mdash;as it might be
me. Then there's main-line engines as it might be this 'ere young
gentleman when he grows up and wins all the races at 'is
school&mdash;so he will. The main-line engine she's built for speed
as well as power. That's one to the 9.15 up."</p>

<p>"The Green Dragon," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"We calls her the Snail, Miss, among ourselves," said the
Porter. "She's oftener be'ind'and nor any train on the line."</p>

<p>"But the engine's green," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss," said Perks, "so's a snail some seasons o' the
year."</p>

<p>The children agreed as they went home to dinner that the Porter
was most delightful company.</p>

<p>Next day was Roberta's birthday. In the afternoon she was
politely but firmly requested to get out of the way and keep there
till tea-time.</p>

<p>"You aren't to see what we're going to do till it's done; it's a
glorious surprise," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>And Roberta went out into the garden all alone. She tried to be
grateful, but she felt she would much rather have helped in
whatever it was than have to spend her birthday afternoon by
herself, no matter how glorious the surprise might be.</p>

<p>Now that she was alone, she had time to think, and one of the
things she thought of most was what mother had said in one of those
feverish nights when her hands were so hot and her eyes so
bright.</p>

<p>The words were: "Oh, what a doctor's bill there'll be for
this!"</p>

<p>She walked round and round the garden among the rose-bushes that
hadn't any roses yet, only buds, and the lilac bushes and syringas
and American currants, and the more she thought of the doctor's
bill, the less she liked the thought of it.</p>

<p>And presently she made up her mind. She went out through the
side door of the garden and climbed up the steep field to where the
road runs along by the canal. She walked along until she came to
the bridge that crosses the canal and leads to the village, and
here she waited. It was very pleasant in the sunshine to lean one's
elbows on the warm stone of the bridge and look down at the blue
water of the canal. Bobbie had never seen any other canal, except
the Regent's Canal, and the water of that is not at all a pretty
colour. And she had never seen any river at all except the Thames,
which also would be all the better if its face was washed.</p>

<p>Perhaps the children would have loved the canal as much as the
railway, but for two things. One was that they had found the
railway <i>first</i>&mdash;on that first, wonderful morning when
the house and the country and the moors and rocks and great hills
were all new to them. They had not found the canal till some days
later. The other reason was that everyone on the railway had been
kind to them&mdash;the Station Master, the Porter, and the old
gentleman who waved. And the people on the canal were anything but
kind.</p>

<p>The people on the canal were, of course, the bargees, who
steered the slow barges up and down, or walked beside the old
horses that trampled up the mud of the towing-path, and strained at
the long tow-ropes.</p>

<p>Peter had once asked one of the bargees the time, and had been
told to "get out of that," in a tone so fierce that he did not stop
to say anything about his having just as much right on the
towing-path as the man himself. Indeed, he did not even think of
saying it till some time later.</p>

<p>Then another day when the children thought they would like to
fish in the canal, a boy in a barge threw lumps of coal at them,
and one of these hit Phyllis on the back of the neck. She was just
stooping down to tie up her bootlace&mdash;and though the coal
hardly hurt at all it made her not care very much about going on
fishing.</p>

<p>On the bridge, however, Roberta felt quite safe, because she
could look down on the canal, and if any boy showed signs of
meaning to throw coal, she could duck behind the parapet.</p>

<p>Presently there was a sound of wheels, which was just what she
expected.</p>

<p>The wheels were the wheels of the Doctor's dogcart, and in the
cart, of course, was the Doctor.</p>

<p>He pulled up, and called out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hullo, head nurse! Want a lift?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to see you," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Your mother's not worse, I hope?" said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, skip in, then, and we'll go for a drive."</p>

<p>Roberta climbed in and the brown horse was made to turn
round&mdash;which it did not like at all, for it was looking
forward to its tea&mdash;I mean its oats.</p>

<p>"This <i>is</i> jolly," said Bobbie, as the dogcart flew along
the road by the canal.</p>

<p>"We could throw a stone down any one of your three chimneys,"
said the Doctor, as they passed the house.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bobbie, "but you'd have to be a jolly good
shot."</p>

<p>"How do you know I'm not?" said the Doctor. "Now, then, what's
the trouble?"</p>

<p>Bobbie fidgeted with the hook of the driving apron.</p>

<p>"Come, out with it," said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"It's rather hard, you see," said Bobbie, "to out with it;
because of what Mother said."</p>

<p>"What <i>did</i> Mother say?"</p>

<p>"She said I wasn't to go telling everyone that we're poor. But
you aren't everyone, are you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the Doctor, cheerfully. "Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, I know doctors are very extravagant&mdash;I mean
expensive, and Mrs. Viney told me that her doctoring only cost her
twopence a week because she belonged to a Club."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"You see she told me what a good doctor you were, and I asked
her how she could afford you, because she's much poorer than we
are. I've been in her house and I know. And then she told me about
the Club, and I thought I'd ask you&mdash;and&mdash;oh, I don't
want Mother to be worried! Can't we be in the Club, too, the same
as Mrs. Viney?"</p>

<p>The Doctor was silent. He was rather poor himself, and he had
been pleased at getting a new family to attend. So I think his
feelings at that minute were rather mixed.</p>

<p>"You aren't cross with me, are you?" said Bobbie, in a very
small voice.</p>

<p>The Doctor roused himself.</p>

<p>"Cross? How could I be? You're a very sensible little woman. Now
look here, don't you worry. I'll make it all right with your
Mother, even if I have to make a special brand-new Club all for
her. Look here, this is where the Aqueduct begins."</p>

<p>"What's an Aque&mdash;what's its name?" asked Bobbie.</p>

<p>"A water bridge," said the Doctor. "Look."</p>

<p>The road rose to a bridge over the canal. To the left was a
steep rocky cliff with trees and shrubs growing in the cracks of
the rock. And the canal here left off running along the top of the
hill and started to run on a bridge of its own&mdash;a great bridge
with tall arches that went right across the valley.</p>

<p>Bobbie drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> grand, isn't it?" she said. "It's like pictures in
the History of Rome."</p>

<p>"Right!" said the Doctor, "that's just exactly what it <i>is</i>
like. The Romans were dead nuts on aqueducts. It's a splendid piece
of engineering."</p>

<p>"I thought engineering was making engines."</p>

<p>"Ah, there are different sorts of engineering&mdash;making road
and bridges and tunnels is one kind. And making fortifications is
another. Well, we must be turning back. And, remember, you aren't
to worry about doctor's bills or you'll be ill yourself, and then
I'll send you in a bill as long as the aqueduct."</p>

<p>When Bobbie had parted from the Doctor at the top of the field
that ran down from the road to Three Chimneys, she could not feel
that she had done wrong. She knew that Mother would perhaps think
differently. But Bobbie felt that for once she was the one who was
right, and she scrambled down the rocky slope with a really happy
feeling.</p>

<p>Phyllis and Peter met her at the back door. They were
unnaturally clean and neat, and Phyllis had a red bow in her hair.
There was only just time for Bobbie to make herself tidy and tie up
her hair with a blue bow before a little bell rang.</p>

<p>"There!" said Phyllis, "that's to show the surprise is ready.
Now you wait till the bell rings again and then you may come into
the dining-room."</p>

<p>So Bobbie waited.</p>

<p>"Tinkle, tinkle," said the little bell, and Bobbie went into the
dining-room, feeling rather shy. Directly she opened the door she
found herself, as it seemed, in a new world of light and flowers
and singing. Mother and Peter and Phyllis were standing in a row at
the end of the table. The shutters were shut and there were twelve
candles on the table, one for each of Roberta's years. The table
was covered with a sort of pattern of flowers, and at Roberta's
place was a thick wreath of forget-me-nots and several most
interesting little packages. And Mother and Phyllis and Peter were
singing&mdash;to the first part of the tune of St. Patrick's Day.
Roberta knew that Mother had written the words on purpose for her
birthday. It was a little way of Mother's on birthdays. It had
begun on Bobbie's fourth birthday when Phyllis was a baby. Bobbie
remembered learning the verses to say to Father 'for a surprise.'
She wondered if Mother had remembered, too. The four-year-old verse
had been:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>Daddy dear, I'm only four<br>
And I'd rather not be more.<br>
Four's the nicest age to be,<br>
Two and two and one and three.<br>
What I love is two and two,<br>
Mother, Peter, Phil, and you.<br>
What you love is one and three,<br>
Mother, Peter, Phil, and me.<br>
Give your little girl a kiss<br>
Because she learned and told you this.</blockquote>

<p>The song the others were singing now went like this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>Our darling Roberta,<br>
No sorrow shall hurt her<br>
If we can prevent it<br>
Her whole life long.<br>
Her birthday's our fete day,<br>
We'll make it our great day,<br>
And give her our presents<br>
And sing her our song.<br>
May pleasures attend her<br>
And may the Fates send her<br>
The happiest journey<br>
Along her life's way.<br>
With skies bright above her<br>
And dear ones to love her!<br>
Dear Bob! Many happy<br>
Returns of the day!</blockquote>

<p>When they had finished singing they cried, "Three cheers for our
Bobbie!" and gave them very loudly. Bobbie felt exactly as though
she were going to cry&mdash;you know that odd feeling in the bridge
of your nose and the pricking in your eyelids? But before she had
time to begin they were all kissing and hugging her.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mother, "look at your presents."</p>

<p>They were very nice presents. There was a green and red
needle-book that Phyllis had made herself in secret moments. There
was a darling little silver brooch of Mother's shaped like a
buttercup, which Bobbie had known and loved for years, but which
she had never, never thought would come to be her very own. There
was also a pair of blue glass vases from Mrs. Viney. Roberta had
seen and admired them in the village shop. And there were three
birthday cards with pretty pictures and wishes.</p>

<p>Mother fitted the forget-me-not crown on Bobbie's brown
head.</p>

<p>"And now look at the table," she said.</p>

<p>There was a cake on the table covered with white sugar, with
'Dear Bobbie' on it in pink sweets, and there were buns and jam;
but the nicest thing was that the big table was almost covered with
flowers&mdash;wallflowers were laid all round the
tea-tray&mdash;there was a ring of forget-me-nots round each plate.
The cake had a wreath of white lilac round it, and in the middle
was something that looked like a pattern all done with single
blooms of lilac or wallflower or laburnum.</p>

<p>"It's a map&mdash;a map of the railway!" cried Peter.
"Look&mdash;those lilac lines are the metals&mdash;and there's the
station done in brown wallflowers. The laburnum is the train, and
there are the signal- boxes, and the road up to here&mdash;and
those fat red daisies are us three waving to the old
gentleman&mdash;that's him, the pansy in the laburnum train."</p>

<p>"And there's 'Three Chimneys' done in the purple primroses,"
said Phyllis. "And that little tiny rose-bud is Mother looking out
for us when we're late for tea. Peter invented it all, and we got
all the flowers from the station. We thought you'd like it
better."</p>

<p>"That's my present," said Peter, suddenly dumping down his
adored steam-engine on the table in front of her. Its tender had
been lined with fresh white paper, and was full of sweets.</p>

<p>"Oh, Peter!" cried Bobbie, quite overcome by this munificence,
"not your own dear little engine that you're so fond of?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Peter, very promptly, "not the engine. Only the
sweets."</p>

<p>Bobbie couldn't help her face changing a little&mdash;not so
much because she was disappointed at not getting the engine, as
because she had thought it so very noble of Peter, and now she felt
she had been silly to think it. Also she felt she must have seemed
greedy to expect the engine as well as the sweets. So her face
changed. Peter saw it. He hesitated a minute; then his face
changed, too, and he said: "I mean not <i>all</i> the engine. I'll
let you go halves if you like."</p>

<p>"You're a brick," cried Bobbie; "it's a splendid present." She
said no more aloud, but to herself she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That was awfully jolly decent of Peter because I know he didn't
mean to. Well, the broken half shall be my half of the engine, and
I'll get it mended and give it back to Peter for his
birthday."&mdash; "Yes, Mother dear, I should like to cut the
cake," she added, and tea began.</p>

<p>It was a delightful birthday. After tea Mother played games with
them&mdash;any game they liked&mdash;and of course their first
choice was blindman's-buff, in the course of which Bobbie's
forget-me-not wreath twisted itself crookedly over one of her ears
and stayed there. Then, when it was near bed-time and time to calm
down, Mother had a lovely new story to read to them.</p>

<p>"You won't sit up late working, will you, Mother?" Bobbie asked
as they said good night.</p>

<p>And Mother said no, she wouldn't&mdash;she would only just write
to Father and then go to bed.</p>

<p>But when Bobbie crept down later to bring up her
presents&mdash;for she felt she really could not be separated from
them all night&mdash;Mother was not writing, but leaning her head
on her arms and her arms on the table. I think it was rather good
of Bobbie to slip quietly away, saying over and over, "She doesn't
want me to know she's unhappy, and I won't know; I won't know." But
it made a sad end to the birthday.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>The very next morning Bobbie began to watch her opportunity to
get Peter's engine mended secretly. And the opportunity came the
very next afternoon.</p>

<p>Mother went by train to the nearest town to do shopping. When
she went there, she always went to the Post-office. Perhaps to post
her letters to Father, for she never gave them to the children or
Mrs. Viney to post, and she never went to the village herself.
Peter and Phyllis went with her. Bobbie wanted an excuse not to go,
but try as she would she couldn't think of a good one. And just
when she felt that all was lost, her frock caught on a big nail by
the kitchen door and there was a great criss-cross tear all along
the front of the skirt. I assure you this was really an accident.
So the others pitied her and went without her, for there was no
time for her to change, because they were rather late already and
had to hurry to the station to catch the train.</p>

<p>When they had gone, Bobbie put on her everyday frock, and went
down to the railway. She did not go into the station, but she went
along the line to the end of the platform where the engine is when
the down train is alongside the platform&mdash;the place where
there are a water tank and a long, limp, leather hose, like an
elephant's trunk. She hid behind a bush on the other side of the
railway. She had the toy engine done up in brown paper, and she
waited patiently with it under her arm.</p>

<p>Then when the next train came in and stopped, Bobbie went across
the metals of the up-line and stood beside the engine. She had
never been so close to an engine before. It looked much larger and
harder than she had expected, and it made her feel very small
indeed, and, somehow, very soft&mdash;as if she could very, very
easily be hurt rather badly.</p>

<p>"I know what silk-worms feel like now," said Bobbie to
herself.</p>

<p>The engine-driver and fireman did not see her. They were leaning
out on the other side, telling the Porter a tale about a dog and a
leg of mutton.</p>

<p>"If you please," said Roberta&mdash;but the engine was blowing
off steam and no one heard her.</p>

<p>"If you please, Mr. Engineer," she spoke a little louder, but
the Engine happened to speak at the same moment, and of course
Roberta's soft little voice hadn't a chance.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that the only way would be to climb on to the
engine and pull at their coats. The step was high, but she got her
knee on it, and clambered into the cab; she stumbled and fell on
hands and knees on the base of the great heap of coals that led up
to the square opening in the tender. The engine was not above the
weaknesses of its fellows; it was making a great deal more noise
than there was the slightest need for. And just as Roberta fell on
the coals, the engine-driver, who had turned without seeing her,
started the engine, and when Bobbie had picked herself up, the
train was moving&mdash;not fast, but much too fast for her to get
off.</p>

<p>All sorts of dreadful thoughts came to her all together in one
horrible flash. There were such things as express trains that went
on, she supposed, for hundreds of miles without stopping. Suppose
this should be one of them? How would she get home again? She had
no money to pay for the return journey.</p>

<p>"And I've no business here. I'm an engine-burglar&mdash;that's
what I am," she thought. "I shouldn't wonder if they could lock me
up for this." And the train was going faster and faster.</p>

<p>There was something in her throat that made it impossible for
her to speak. She tried twice. The men had their backs to her. They
were doing something to things that looked like taps.</p>

<p>Suddenly she put out her hand and caught hold of the nearest
sleeve. The man turned with a start, and he and Roberta stood for a
minute looking at each other in silence. Then the silence was
broken by them both.</p>

<p>The man said, "Here's a bloomin' go!" and Roberta burst into
tears.</p>

<p>The other man said he was blooming well blest&mdash;or something
like it&mdash;but though naturally surprised they were not exactly
unkind.</p>

<p>"You're a naughty little gell, that's what you are," said the
fireman, and the engine-driver said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Daring little piece, I call her," but they made her sit down on
an iron seat in the cab and told her to stop crying and tell them
what she meant by it.</p>

<p>She did stop, as soon as she could. One thing that helped her
was the thought that Peter would give almost his ears to be in her
place&mdash;on a real engine&mdash;really going. The children had
often wondered whether any engine-driver could be found noble
enough to take them for a ride on an engine&mdash;and now there she
was. She dried her eyes and sniffed earnestly.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said the fireman, "out with it. What do you mean by
it, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, please," sniffed Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Try again," said the engine-driver, encouragingly.</p>

<p>Bobbie tried again.</p>

<p>"Please, Mr. Engineer," she said, "I did call out to you from
the line, but you didn't hear me&mdash;and I just climbed up to
touch you on the arm&mdash;quite gently I meant to do it&mdash;and
then I fell into the coals&mdash;and I am so sorry if I frightened
you. Oh, don't be cross&mdash; oh, please don't!" She sniffed
again.</p>

<p>"We ain't so much <i>cross</i>," said the fireman, "as
interested like. It ain't every day a little gell tumbles into our
coal bunker outer the sky, is it, Bill? What did you <i>do</i> it
for&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"That's the point," agreed the engine-driver; "what did you do
it <i>for</i>?"</p>

<p>Bobbie found that she had not quite stopped crying. The
engine-driver patted her on the back and said: "Here, cheer up,
Mate. It ain't so bad as all that 'ere, I'll be bound."</p>

<p>"I wanted," said Bobbie, much cheered to find herself addressed
as 'Mate'&mdash;"I only wanted to ask you if you'd be so kind as to
mend this." She picked up the brown-paper parcel from among the
coals and undid the string with hot, red fingers that trembled.</p>

<p>Her feet and legs felt the scorch of the engine fire, but her
shoulders felt the wild chill rush of the air. The engine lurched
and shook and rattled, and as they shot under a bridge the engine
seemed to shout in her ears.</p>

<p>The fireman shovelled on coals.</p>

<p>Bobbie unrolled the brown paper and disclosed the toy
engine.</p>

<p>"I thought," she said wistfully, "that perhaps you'd mend this
for me&mdash;because you're an engineer, you know."</p>

<p>The engine-driver said he was blowed if he wasn't blest.</p>

<p>"I'm blest if I ain't blowed," remarked the fireman.</p>

<p>But the engine-driver took the little engine and looked at
it&mdash;and the fireman ceased for an instant to shovel coal, and
looked, too.</p>

<p>"It's like your precious cheek," said the
engine-driver&mdash;"whatever made you think we'd be bothered
tinkering penny toys?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it for precious cheek," said Bobbie; "only
everybody that has anything to do with railways is so kind and
good, I didn't think you'd mind. You don't really&mdash;do you?"
she added, for she had seen a not unkindly wink pass between the
two.</p>

<p>"My trade's driving of an engine, not mending her, especially
such a hout-size in engines as this 'ere," said Bill. "An' 'ow are
we a-goin' to get you back to your sorrowing friends and relations,
and all be forgiven and forgotten?"</p>

<p>"If you'll put me down next time you stop," said Bobbie, firmly,
though her heart beat fiercely against her arm as she clasped her
hands, "and lend me the money for a third-class ticket, I'll pay
you back&mdash;honour bright. I'm not a confidence trick like in
the newspapers&mdash;really, I'm not."</p>

<p>"You're a little lady, every inch," said Bill, relenting
suddenly and completely. "We'll see you gets home safe. An' about
this engine&mdash;Jim&mdash;ain't you got ne'er a pal as can use a
soldering iron? Seems to me that's about all the little bounder
wants doing to it."</p>

<p>"That's what Father said," Bobbie explained eagerly. "What's
that for?"</p>

<p>She pointed to a little brass wheel that he had turned as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"That's the injector."</p>

<p>"In&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Injector to fill up the boiler."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Bobbie, mentally registering the fact to tell the
others; "that <i>is</i> interesting."</p>

<p>"This 'ere's the automatic brake," Bill went on, flattered by
her enthusiasm. "You just move this 'ere little handle&mdash;do it
with one finger, you can&mdash;and the train jolly soon stops.
That's what they call the Power of Science in the newspapers."</p>

<p>He showed her two little dials, like clock faces, and told her
how one showed how much steam was going, and the other showed if
the brake was working properly.</p>

<p>By the time she had seen him shut off steam with a big shining
steel handle, Bobbie knew more about the inside working of an
engine than she had ever thought there was to know, and Jim had
promised that his second cousin's wife's brother should solder the
toy engine, or Jim would know the reason why. Besides all the
knowledge she had gained Bobbie felt that she and Bill and Jim were
now friends for life, and that they had wholly and forever forgiven
her for stumbling uninvited among the sacred coals of their
tender.</p>

<p>At Stacklepoole Junction she parted from them with warm
expressions of mutual regard. They handed her over to the guard of
a returning train&mdash;a friend of theirs&mdash;and she had the
joy of knowing what guards do in their secret fastnesses, and
understood how, when you pull the communication cord in railway
carriages, a wheel goes round under the guard's nose and a loud
bell rings in his ears. She asked the guard why his van smelt so
fishy, and learned that he had to carry a lot of fish every day,
and that the wetness in the hollows of the corrugated floor had all
drained out of boxes full of plaice and cod and mackerel and soles
and smelts.</p>

<p>Bobbie got home in time for tea, and she felt as though her mind
would burst with all that had been put into it since she parted
from the others. How she blessed the nail that had torn her
frock!</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" asked the others.</p>

<p>"To the station, of course," said Roberta. But she would not
tell a word of her adventures till the day appointed, when she
mysteriously led them to the station at the hour of the 3.19's
transit, and proudly introduced them to her friends, Bill and Jim.
Jim's second cousin's wife's brother had not been unworthy of the
sacred trust reposed in him. The toy engine was, literally, as good
as new.</p>

<p>"Good-bye&mdash;oh, good-bye," said Bobbie, just before the
engine screamed <i>its</i> good-bye. "I shall always, always love
you&mdash;and Jim's second cousin's wife's brother as well!"</p>

<p>And as the three children went home up the hill, Peter hugging
the engine, now quite its own self again, Bobbie told, with joyous
leaps of the heart, the story of how she had been an
Engine-burglar.</p>

<h2>Chapter V. Prisoners and captives.</h2>

<p>It was one day when Mother had gone to Maidbridge. She had gone
alone, but the children were to go to the station to meet her. And,
loving the station as they did, it was only natural that they
should be there a good hour before there was any chance of Mother's
train arriving, even if the train were punctual, which was most
unlikely. No doubt they would have been just as early, even if it
had been a fine day, and all the delights of woods and fields and
rocks and rivers had been open to them. But it happened to be a
very wet day and, for July, very cold. There was a wild wind that
drove flocks of dark purple clouds across the sky "like herds of
dream-elephants," as Phyllis said. And the rain stung sharply, so
that the way to the station was finished at a run. Then the rain
fell faster and harder, and beat slantwise against the windows of
the booking office and of the chill place that had General Waiting
Room on its door.</p>

<p>"It's like being in a besieged castle," Phyllis said; "look at
the arrows of the foe striking against the battlements!"</p>

<p>"It's much more like a great garden-squirt," said Peter.</p>

<p>They decided to wait on the up side, for the down platform
looked very wet indeed, and the rain was driving right into the
little bleak shelter where down-passengers have to wait for their
trains.</p>

<p>The hour would be full of incident and of interest, for there
would be two up trains and one down to look at before the one that
should bring Mother back.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it'll have stopped raining by then," said Bobbie;
"anyhow, I'm glad I brought Mother's waterproof and umbrella."</p>

<p>They went into the desert spot labelled General Waiting Room,
and the time passed pleasantly enough in a game of advertisements.
You know the game, of course? It is something like dumb Crambo. The
players take it in turns to go out, and then come back and look as
like some advertisement as they can, and the others have to guess
what advertisement it is meant to be. Bobbie came in and sat down
under Mother's umbrella and made a sharp face, and everyone knew
she was the fox who sits under the umbrella in the advertisement.
Phyllis tried to make a Magic Carpet of Mother's waterproof, but it
would not stand out stiff and raft-like as a Magic Carpet should,
and nobody could guess it. Everyone thought Peter was carrying
things a little too far when he blacked his face all over with
coal-dust and struck a spidery attitude and said he was the blot
that advertises somebody's Blue Black Writing Fluid.</p>

<p>It was Phyllis's turn again, and she was trying to look like the
Sphinx that advertises What's-his-name's Personally Conducted Tours
up the Nile when the sharp ting of the signal announced the up
train. The children rushed out to see it pass. On its engine were
the particular driver and fireman who were now numbered among the
children's dearest friends. Courtesies passed between them. Jim
asked after the toy engine, and Bobbie pressed on his acceptance a
moist, greasy package of toffee that she had made herself.</p>

<p>Charmed by this attention, the engine-driver consented to
consider her request that some day he would take Peter for a ride
on the engine.</p>

<p>"Stand back, Mates," cried the engine-driver, suddenly, "and
horf she goes."</p>

<p>And sure enough, off the train went. The children watched the
tail-lights of the train till it disappeared round the curve of the
line, and then turned to go back to the dusty freedom of the
General Waiting Room and the joys of the advertisement game.</p>

<p>They expected to see just one or two people, the end of the
procession of passengers who had given up their tickets and gone
away. Instead, the platform round the door of the station had a
dark blot round it, and the dark blot was a crowd of people.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Peter, with a thrill of joyous excitement,
"something's happened! Come on!"</p>

<p>They ran down the platform. When they got to the crowd, they
could, of course, see nothing but the damp backs and elbows of the
people on the crowd's outside. Everybody was talking at once. It
was evident that something had happened.</p>

<p>"It's my belief he's nothing worse than a natural," said a
farmerish-looking person. Peter saw his red, clean-shaven face as
he spoke.</p>

<p>"If you ask me, I should say it was a Police Court case," said a
young man with a black bag.</p>

<p>"Not it; the Infirmary more like&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then the voice of the Station Master was heard, firm and
official:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, then&mdash;move along there. I'll attend to this, if
<i>you</i> please."</p>

<p>But the crowd did not move. And then came a voice that thrilled
the children through and through. For it spoke in a foreign
language. And, what is more, it was a language that they had never
heard. They had heard French spoken and German. Aunt Emma knew
German, and used to sing a song about bedeuten and zeiten and bin
and sin. Nor was it Latin. Peter had been in Latin for four
terms.</p>

<p>It was some comfort, anyhow, to find that none of the crowd
understood the foreign language any better than the children
did.</p>

<p>"What's that he's saying?" asked the farmer, heavily.</p>

<p>"Sounds like French to me," said the Station Master, who had
once been to Boulogne for the day.</p>

<p>"It isn't French!" cried Peter.</p>

<p>"What is it, then?" asked more than one voice. The crowd fell
back a little to see who had spoken, and Peter pressed forward, so
that when the crowd closed up again he was in the front rank.</p>

<p>"I don't know what it is," said Peter, "but it isn't French. I
know that." Then he saw what it was that the crowd had for its
centre. It was a man&mdash;the man, Peter did not doubt, who had
spoken in that strange tongue. A man with long hair and wild eyes,
with shabby clothes of a cut Peter had not seen before&mdash;a man
whose hands and lips trembled, and who spoke again as his eyes fell
on Peter.</p>

<p>"No, it's not French," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Try him with French if you know so much about it," said the
farmer-man.</p>

<p>"Parlay voo Frongsay?" began Peter, boldly, and the next moment
the crowd recoiled again, for the man with the wild eyes had left
leaning against the wall, and had sprung forward and caught Peter's
hands, and begun to pour forth a flood of words which, though he
could not understand a word of them, Peter knew the sound of.</p>

<p>"There!" said he, and turned, his hands still clasped in the
hands of the strange shabby figure, to throw a glance of triumph at
the crowd; "there; <i>that's</i> French."</p>

<p>"What does he say?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." Peter was obliged to own it.</p>

<p>"Here," said the Station Master again; "you move on if you
please. <i>I'll</i> deal with this case."</p>

<p>A few of the more timid or less inquisitive travellers moved
slowly and reluctantly away. And Phyllis and Bobbie got near to
Peter. All three had been <i>taught</i> French at school. How
deeply they now wished that they had <i>learned</i> it! Peter shook
his head at the stranger, but he also shook his hands as warmly and
looked at him as kindly as he could. A person in the crowd, after
some hesitation, said suddenly, "No comprenny!" and then, blushing
deeply, backed out of the press and went away.</p>

<p>"Take him into your room," whispered Bobbie to the Station
Master. "Mother can talk French. She'll be here by the next train
from Maidbridge."</p>

<p>The Station Master took the arm of the stranger, suddenly but
not unkindly. But the man wrenched his arm away, and cowered back
coughing and trembling and trying to push the Station Master
away.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't!" said Bobbie; "don't you see how frightened he is?
He thinks you're going to shut him up. I know he does&mdash;look at
his eyes!"</p>

<p>"They're like a fox's eyes when the beast's in a trap," said the
farmer.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me try!" Bobbie went on; "I do really know one or two
French words if I could only think of them."</p>

<p>Sometimes, in moments of great need, we can do wonderful
things&mdash; things that in ordinary life we could hardly even
dream of doing. Bobbie had never been anywhere near the top of her
French class, but she must have learned something without knowing
it, for now, looking at those wild, hunted eyes, she actually
remembered and, what is more, spoke, some French words. She
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Vous attendre. Ma mere parlez Francais. Nous&mdash;what's the
French for 'being kind'?"</p>

<p>Nobody knew.</p>

<p>"Bong is 'good,'" said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"Nous etre bong pour vous."</p>

<p>I do not know whether the man understood her words, but he
understood the touch of the hand she thrust into his, and the
kindness of the other hand that stroked his shabby sleeve.</p>

<p>She pulled him gently towards the inmost sanctuary of the
Station Master. The other children followed, and the Station Master
shut the door in the face of the crowd, which stood a little while
in the booking office talking and looking at the fast closed yellow
door, and then by ones and twos went its way, grumbling.</p>

<p>Inside the Station Master's room Bobbie still held the
stranger's hand and stroked his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Here's a go," said the Station Master; "no ticket&mdash;doesn't
even know where he wants to go. I'm not sure now but what I ought
to send for the police."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>don't</i>!" all the children pleaded at once. And
suddenly Bobbie got between the others and the stranger, for she
had seen that he was crying.</p>

<p>By a most unusual piece of good fortune she had a handkerchief
in her pocket. By a still more uncommon accident the handkerchief
was moderately clean. Standing in front of the stranger, she got
out the handkerchief and passed it to him so that the others did
not see.</p>

<p>"Wait till Mother comes," Phyllis was saying; "she does speak
French beautifully. You'd just love to hear her."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he hasn't done anything like you're sent to prison
for," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Looks like without visible means to me," said the Station
Master. "Well, I don't mind giving him the benefit of the doubt
till your Mamma comes. I <i>should</i> like to know what nation's
got the credit of <i>him</i>, that I should."</p>

<p>Then Peter had an idea. He pulled an envelope out of his pocket,
and showed that it was half full of foreign stamps.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, "let's show him these&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bobbie looked and saw that the stranger had dried his eyes with
her handkerchief. So she said: "All right."</p>

<p>They showed him an Italian stamp, and pointed from him to it and
back again, and made signs of question with their eyebrows. He
shook his head. Then they showed him a Norwegian stamp&mdash;the
common blue kind it was&mdash;and again he signed No. Then they
showed him a Spanish one, and at that he took the envelope from
Peter's hand and searched among the stamps with a hand that
trembled. The hand that he reached out at last, with a gesture as
of one answering a question, contained a <i>Russian</i> stamp.</p>

<p>"He's Russian," cried Peter, "or else he's like 'the man who
was'&mdash; in Kipling, you know."</p>

<p>The train from Maidbridge was signalled.</p>

<p>"I'll stay with him till you bring Mother in," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"You're not afraid, Missie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Bobbie, looking at the stranger, as she might
have looked at a strange dog of doubtful temper. "You wouldn't hurt
me, would you?"</p>

<p>She smiled at him, and he smiled back, a queer crooked smile.
And then he coughed again. And the heavy rattling swish of the
incoming train swept past, and the Station Master and Peter and
Phyllis went out to meet it. Bobbie was still holding the
stranger's hand when they came back with Mother.</p>

<p>The Russian rose and bowed very ceremoniously.</p>

<p>Then Mother spoke in French, and he replied, haltingly at first,
but presently in longer and longer sentences.</p>

<p>The children, watching his face and Mother's, knew that he was
telling her things that made her angry and pitying, and sorry and
indignant all at once.</p>

<p>"Well, Mum, what's it all about?" The Station Master could not
restrain his curiosity any longer.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mother, "it's all right. He's a Russian, and he's
lost his ticket. And I'm afraid he's very ill. If you don't mind,
I'll take him home with me now. He's really quite worn out. I'll
run down and tell you all about him to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't find you're taking home a frozen viper," said
the Station Master, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Mother said brightly, and she smiled; "I'm quite sure
I'm not. Why, he's a great man in his own country, writes
books&mdash; beautiful books&mdash;I've read some of them; but I'll
tell you all about it to-morrow."</p>

<p>She spoke again in French to the Russian, and everyone could see
the surprise and pleasure and gratitude in his eyes. He got up and
politely bowed to the Station Master, and offered his arm most
ceremoniously to Mother. She took it, but anybody could have seen
that she was helping him along, and not he her.</p>

<p>"You girls run home and light a fire in the sitting-room,"
Mother said, "and Peter had better go for the Doctor."</p>

<p>But it was Bobbie who went for the Doctor.</p>

<p>"I hate to tell you," she said breathlessly when she came upon
him in his shirt sleeves, weeding his pansy-bed, "but Mother's got
a very shabby Russian, and I'm sure he'll have to belong to your
Club. I'm certain he hasn't got any money. We found him at the
station."</p>

<p>"Found him! Was he lost, then?" asked the Doctor, reaching for
his coat.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bobbie, unexpectedly, "that's just what he was. He's
been telling Mother the sad, sweet story of his life in French; and
she said would you be kind enough to come directly if you were at
home. He has a dreadful cough, and he's been crying."</p>

<p>The Doctor smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't," said Bobbie; "please don't. You wouldn't if you'd
seen him. I never saw a man cry before. You don't know what it's
like."</p>

<p>Dr. Forrest wished then that he hadn't smiled.</p>

<p>When Bobbie and the Doctor got to Three Chimneys, the Russian
was sitting in the arm-chair that had been Father's, stretching his
feet to the blaze of a bright wood fire, and sipping the tea Mother
had made him.</p>

<p>"The man seems worn out, mind and body," was what the Doctor
said; "the cough's bad, but there's nothing that can't be cured. He
ought to go straight to bed, though&mdash;and let him have a fire
at night."</p>

<p>"I'll make one in my room; it's the only one with a fireplace,"
said Mother. She did, and presently the Doctor helped the stranger
to bed.</p>

<p>There was a big black trunk in Mother's room that none of the
children had ever seen unlocked. Now, when she had lighted the
fire, she unlocked it and took some clothes out&mdash;men's
clothes&mdash;and set them to air by the newly lighted fire.
Bobbie, coming in with more wood for the fire, saw the mark on the
night-shirt, and looked over to the open trunk. All the things she
could see were men's clothes. And the name marked on the shirt was
Father's name. Then Father hadn't taken his clothes with him. And
that night-shirt was one of Father's new ones. Bobbie remembered
its being made, just before Peter's birthday. Why hadn't Father
taken his clothes? Bobbie slipped from the room. As she went she
heard the key turned in the lock of the trunk. Her heart was
beating horribly. <i>Why</i> hadn't Father taken his clothes? When
Mother came out of the room, Bobbie flung tightly clasping arms
round her waist, and whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mother&mdash;Daddy isn't&mdash;isn't <i>dead</i>, is he?"</p>

<p>"My darling, no! What made you think of anything so
horrible?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," said Bobbie, angry with herself, but
still clinging to that resolution of hers, not to see anything that
Mother didn't mean her to see.</p>

<p>Mother gave her a hurried hug. "Daddy was quite, <i>quite</i>
well when I heard from him last," she said, "and he'll come back to
us some day. Don't fancy such horrible things, darling!"</p>

<p>Later on, when the Russian stranger had been made comfortable
for the night, Mother came into the girls' room. She was to sleep
there in Phyllis's bed, and Phyllis was to have a mattress on the
floor, a most amusing adventure for Phyllis. Directly Mother came
in, two white figures started up, and two eager voices
called:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, Mother, tell us all about the Russian gentleman."</p>

<p>A white shape hopped into the room. It was Peter, dragging his
quilt behind him like the tail of a white peacock.</p>

<p>"We have been patient," he said, "and I had to bite my tongue
not to go to sleep, and I just nearly went to sleep and I bit too
hard, and it hurts ever so. <i>Do</i> tell us. Make a nice long
story of it."</p>

<p>"I can't make a long story of it to-night," said Mother; "I'm
very tired."</p>

<p>Bobbie knew by her voice that Mother had been crying, but the
others didn't know.</p>

<p>"Well, make it as long as you can," said Phil, and Bobbie got
her arms round Mother's waist and snuggled close to her.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a story long enough to make a whole book of. He's a
writer; he's written beautiful books. In Russia at the time of the
Czar one dared not say anything about the rich people doing wrong,
or about the things that ought to be done to make poor people
better and happier. If one did one was sent to prison."</p>

<p>"But they <i>can't</i>," said Peter; "people only go to prison
when they've done wrong."</p>

<p>"Or when the Judges <i>think</i> they've done wrong," said
Mother. "Yes, that's so in England. But in Russia it was different.
And he wrote a beautiful book about poor people and how to help
them. I've read it. There's nothing in it but goodness and
kindness. And they sent him to prison for it. He was three years in
a horrible dungeon, with hardly any light, and all damp and
dreadful. In prison all alone for three years."</p>

<p>Mother's voice trembled a little and stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>"But, Mother," said Peter, "that can't be true <i>now</i>. It
sounds like something out of a history book&mdash;the Inquisition,
or something."</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> true," said Mother; "it's all horribly true.
Well, then they took him out and sent him to Siberia, a convict
chained to other convicts&mdash;wicked men who'd done all sorts of
crimes&mdash;a long chain of them, and they walked, and walked, and
walked, for days and weeks, till he thought they'd never stop
walking. And overseers went behind them with whips&mdash;yes,
whips&mdash;to beat them if they got tired. And some of them went
lame, and some fell down, and when they couldn't get up and go on,
they beat them, and then left them to die. Oh, it's all too
terrible! And at last he got to the mines, and he was condemned to
stay there for life&mdash;for life, just for writing a good, noble,
splendid book."</p>

<p>"How did he get away?"</p>

<p>"When the war came, some of the Russian prisoners were allowed
to volunteer as soldiers. And he volunteered. But he deserted at
the first chance he got and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But that's very cowardly, isn't it"&mdash;said Peter&mdash;"to
desert? Especially when it's war."</p>

<p>"Do you think he owed anything to a country that had done
<i>that</i> to him? If he did, he owed more to his wife and
children. He didn't know what had become of them."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Bobbie, "he had <i>them</i> to think about and be
miserable about <i>too</i>, then, all the time he was in
prison?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he had them to think about and be miserable about all the
time he was in prison. For anything he knew they might have been
sent to prison, too. They did those things in Russia. But while he
was in the mines some friends managed to get a message to him that
his wife and children had escaped and come to England. So when he
deserted he came here to look for them."</p>

<p>"Had he got their address?" said practical Peter.</p>

<p>"No; just England. He was going to London, and he thought he had
to change at our station, and then he found he'd lost his ticket
and his purse."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>do</i> you think he'll find them?&mdash;I mean his wife
and children, not the ticket and things."</p>

<p>"I hope so. Oh, I hope and pray that he'll find his wife and
children again."</p>

<p>Even Phyllis now perceived that mother's voice was very
unsteady.</p>

<p>"Why, Mother," she said, "how very sorry you seem to be for
him!"</p>

<p>Mother didn't answer for a minute. Then she just said, "Yes,"
and then she seemed to be thinking. The children were quiet.</p>

<p>Presently she said, "Dears, when you say your prayers, I think
you might ask God to show His pity upon all prisoners and
captives."</p>

<p>"To show His pity," Bobbie repeated slowly, "upon all prisoners
and captives. Is that right, Mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mother, "upon all prisoners and captives. All
prisoners and captives."</p>

<h2>Chapter VI. Saviours of the train.</h2>

<p>The Russian gentleman was better the next day, and the day after
that better still, and on the third day he was well enough to come
into the garden. A basket chair was put for him and he sat there,
dressed in clothes of Father's which were too big for him. But when
Mother had hemmed up the ends of the sleeves and the trousers, the
clothes did well enough. His was a kind face now that it was no
longer tired and frightened, and he smiled at the children whenever
he saw them. They wished very much that he could speak English.
Mother wrote several letters to people she thought might know
whereabouts in England a Russian gentleman's wife and family might
possibly be; not to the people she used to know before she came to
live at Three Chimneys&mdash;she never wrote to any of
them&mdash;but strange people&mdash;Members of Parliament and
Editors of papers, and Secretaries of Societies.</p>

<p>And she did not do much of her story-writing, only corrected
proofs as she sat in the sun near the Russian, and talked to him
every now and then.</p>

<p>The children wanted very much to show how kindly they felt to
this man who had been sent to prison and to Siberia just for
writing a beautiful book about poor people. They could smile at
him, of course; they could and they did. But if you smile too
constantly, the smile is apt to get fixed like the smile of the
hyaena. And then it no longer looks friendly, but simply silly. So
they tried other ways, and brought him flowers till the place where
he sat was surrounded by little fading bunches of clover and roses
and Canterbury bells.</p>

<p>And then Phyllis had an idea. She beckoned mysteriously to the
others and drew them into the back yard, and there, in a concealed
spot, between the pump and the water-butt, she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You remember Perks promising me the very first strawberries out
of his own garden?" Perks, you will recollect, was the Porter.
"Well, I should think they're ripe now. Let's go down and see."</p>

<p>Mother had been down as she had promised to tell the Station
Master the story of the Russian Prisoner. But even the charms of
the railway had been unable to tear the children away from the
neighbourhood of the interesting stranger. So they had not been to
the station for three days.</p>

<p>They went now.</p>

<p>And, to their surprise and distress, were very coldly received
by Perks.</p>

<p>"'Ighly honoured, I'm sure," he said when they peeped in at the
door of the Porters' room. And he went on reading his
newspaper.</p>

<p>There was an uncomfortable silence.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," said Bobbie, with a sigh, "I do believe you're
<i>cross</i>."</p>

<p>"What, me? Not me!" said Perks loftily; "it ain't nothing to
me."</p>

<p>"What <i>ain't</i> nothing to you?" said Peter, too anxious and
alarmed to change the form of words.</p>

<p>"Nothing ain't nothing. What 'appens either 'ere or elsewhere,"
said Perks; "if you likes to 'ave your secrets, 'ave 'em and
welcome. That's what I say."</p>

<p>The secret-chamber of each heart was rapidly examined during the
pause that followed. Three heads were shaken.</p>

<p>"We haven't got any secrets from <i>you</i>," said Bobbie at
last.</p>

<p>"Maybe you 'ave, and maybe you 'aven't," said Perks; "it ain't
nothing to me. And I wish you all a very good afternoon." He held
up the paper between him and them and went on reading.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>don't</i>!" said Phyllis, in despair; "this is truly
dreadful! Whatever it is, do tell us."</p>

<p>"We didn't mean to do it whatever it was."</p>

<p>No answer. The paper was refolded and Perks began on another
column.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Peter, suddenly, "it's not fair. Even people
who do crimes aren't punished without being told what it's
for&mdash;as once they were in Russia."</p>

<p>"I don't know nothing about Russia."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you do, when Mother came down on purpose to tell you
and Mr. Gills all about <i>our</i> Russian."</p>

<p>"Can't you fancy it?" said Perks, indignantly; "don't you see
'im a-asking of me to step into 'is room and take a chair and
listen to what 'er Ladyship 'as to say?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you've not heard?"</p>

<p>"Not so much as a breath. I did go so far as to put a question.
And he shuts me up like a rat-trap. 'Affairs of State, Perks,' says
he. But I did think one o' you would 'a' nipped down to tell
me&mdash; you're here sharp enough when you want to get anything
out of old Perks"&mdash;Phyllis flushed purple as she thought of
the strawberries&mdash; "information about locomotives or signals
or the likes," said Perks.</p>

<p>"We didn't know you didn't know."</p>

<p>"We thought Mother had told you."</p>

<p>"Wewantedtotellyouonlywethoughtitwouldbestalenews."</p>

<p>The three spoke all at once.</p>

<p>Perks said it was all very well, and still held up the paper.
Then Phyllis suddenly snatched it away, and threw her arms round
his neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, let's kiss and be friends," she said; "we'll say we're
sorry first, if you like, but we didn't really know that you didn't
know."</p>

<p>"We are so sorry," said the others.</p>

<p>And Perks at last consented to accept their apologies.</p>

<p>Then they got him to come out and sit in the sun on the green
Railway Bank, where the grass was quite hot to touch, and there,
sometimes speaking one at a time, and sometimes all together, they
told the Porter the story of the Russian Prisoner.</p>

<p>"Well, I must say," said Perks; but he did not say
it&mdash;whatever it was.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is pretty awful, isn't it?" said Peter, "and I don't
wonder you were curious about who the Russian was."</p>

<p>"I wasn't curious, not so much as interested," said the
Porter.</p>

<p>"Well, I do think Mr. Gills might have told you about it. It was
horrid of him."</p>

<p>"I don't keep no down on 'im for that, Missie," said the Porter;
"cos why? I see 'is reasons. 'E wouldn't want to give away 'is own
side with a tale like that 'ere. It ain't human nature. A man's got
to stand up for his own side whatever they does. That's what it
means by Party Politics. I should 'a' done the same myself if that
long-'aired chap 'ad 'a' been a Jap."</p>

<p>"But the Japs didn't do cruel, wicked things like that," said
Bobbie.</p>

<p>"P'r'aps not," said Perks, cautiously; "still you can't be sure
with foreigners. My own belief is they're all tarred with the same
brush."</p>

<p>"Then why were you on the side of the Japs?" Peter asked.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, you must take one side or the other. Same as
with Liberals and Conservatives. The great thing is to take your
side and then stick to it, whatever happens."</p>

<p>A signal sounded.</p>

<p>"There's the 3.14 up," said Perks. "You lie low till she's
through, and then we'll go up along to my place, and see if there's
any of them strawberries ripe what I told you about."</p>

<p>"If there are any ripe, and you <i>do</i> give them to me," said
Phyllis, "you won't mind if I give them to the poor Russian, will
you?"</p>

<p>Perks narrowed his eyes and then raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"So it was them strawberries you come down for this afternoon,
eh?" said he.</p>

<p>This was an awkward moment for Phyllis. To say "yes" would seem
rude and greedy, and unkind to Perks. But she knew if she said
"no," she would not be pleased with herself afterwards.
So&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "it was."</p>

<p>"Well done!" said the Porter; "speak the truth and shame
the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But we'd have come down the very next day if we'd known you
hadn't heard the story," Phyllis added hastily.</p>

<p>"I believe you, Missie," said Perks, and sprang across the line
six feet in front of the advancing train.</p>

<p>The girls hated to see him do this, but Peter liked it. It was
so exciting.</p>

<p>The Russian gentleman was so delighted with the strawberries
that the three racked their brains to find some other surprise for
him. But all the racking did not bring out any idea more novel than
wild cherries. And this idea occurred to them next morning. They
had seen the blossom on the trees in the spring, and they knew
where to look for wild cherries now that cherry time was here. The
trees grew all up and along the rocky face of the cliff out of
which the mouth of the tunnel opened. There were all sorts of trees
there, birches and beeches and baby oaks and hazels, and among them
the cherry blossom had shone like snow and silver.</p>

<p>The mouth of the tunnel was some way from Three Chimneys, so
Mother let them take their lunch with them in a basket. And the
basket would do to bring the cherries back in if they found any.
She also lent them her silver watch so that they should not be late
for tea. Peter's Waterbury had taken it into its head not to go
since the day when Peter dropped it into the water-butt. And they
started. When they got to the top of the cutting, they leaned over
the fence and looked down to where the railway lines lay at the
bottom of what, as Phyllis said, was exactly like a mountain
gorge.</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for the railway at the bottom, it would be as
though the foot of man had never been there, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>The sides of the cutting were of grey stone, very roughly hewn.
Indeed, the top part of the cutting had been a little natural glen
that had been cut deeper to bring it down to the level of the
tunnel's mouth. Among the rocks, grass and flowers grew, and seeds
dropped by birds in the crannies of the stone had taken root and
grown into bushes and trees that overhung the cutting. Near the
tunnel was a flight of steps leading down to the line&mdash;just
wooden bars roughly fixed into the earth&mdash;a very steep and
narrow way, more like a ladder than a stair.</p>

<p>"We'd better get down," said Peter; "I'm sure the cherries would
be quite easy to get at from the side of the steps. You remember it
was there we picked the cherry blossoms that we put on the rabbit's
grave."</p>

<p>So they went along the fence towards the little swing gate that
is at the top of these steps. And they were almost at the gate when
Bobbie said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hush. Stop! What's that?"</p>

<p>"That" was a very odd noise indeed&mdash;a soft noise, but quite
plainly to be heard through the sound of the wind in tree branches,
and the hum and whir of the telegraph wires. It was a sort of
rustling, whispering sound. As they listened it stopped, and then
it began again.</p>

<p>And this time it did not stop, but it grew louder and more
rustling and rumbling.</p>

<p>"Look"&mdash;cried Peter, suddenly&mdash;"the tree over
there!"</p>

<p>The tree he pointed at was one of those that have rough grey
leaves and white flowers. The berries, when they come, are bright
scarlet, but if you pick them, they disappoint you by turning black
before you get them home. And, as Peter pointed, the tree was
moving&mdash;not just the way trees ought to move when the wind
blows through them, but all in one piece, as though it were a live
creature and were walking down the side of the cutting.</p>

<p>"It's moving!" cried Bobbie. "Oh, look! and so are the others.
It's like the woods in Macbeth."</p>

<p>"It's magic," said Phyllis, breathlessly. "I always knew this
railway was enchanted."</p>

<p>It really did seem a little like magic. For all the trees for
about twenty yards of the opposite bank seemed to be slowly walking
down towards the railway line, the tree with the grey leaves
bringing up the rear like some old shepherd driving a flock of
green sheep.</p>

<p>"What is it? Oh, what is it?" said Phyllis; "it's much too magic
for me. I don't like it. Let's go home."</p>

<p>But Bobbie and Peter clung fast to the rail and watched
breathlessly. And Phyllis made no movement towards going home by
herself.</p>

<p>The trees moved on and on. Some stones and loose earth fell down
and rattled on the railway metals far below.</p>

<p>"It's <i>all</i> coming down," Peter tried to say, but he found
there was hardly any voice to say it with. And, indeed, just as he
spoke, the great rock, on the top of which the walking trees were,
leaned slowly forward. The trees, ceasing to walk, stood still and
shivered. Leaning with the rock, they seemed to hesitate a moment,
and then rock and trees and grass and bushes, with a rushing sound,
slipped right away from the face of the cutting and fell on the
line with a blundering crash that could have been heard half a mile
off. A cloud of dust rose up.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Peter, in awestruck tones, "isn't it exactly like
when coals come in?&mdash;if there wasn't any roof to the cellar
and you could see down."</p>

<p>"Look what a great mound it's made!" said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter, slowly. He was still leaning on the fence.
"Yes," he said again, still more slowly.</p>

<p>Then he stood upright.</p>

<p>"The 11.29 down hasn't gone by yet. We must let them know at the
station, or there'll be a most frightful accident."</p>

<p>"Let's run," said Bobbie, and began.</p>

<p>But Peter cried, "Come back!" and looked at Mother's watch. He
was very prompt and businesslike, and his face looked whiter than
they had ever seen it.</p>

<p>"No time," he said; "it's two miles away, and it's past
eleven."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we," suggested Phyllis, breathlessly, "couldn't we
climb up a telegraph post and do something to the wires?"</p>

<p>"We don't know how," said Peter.</p>

<p>"They do it in war," said Phyllis; "I know I've heard of
it."</p>

<p>"They only <i>cut</i> them, silly," said Peter, "and that
doesn't do any good. And we couldn't cut them even if we got up,
and we couldn't get up. If we had anything red, we could get down
on the line and wave it."</p>

<p>"But the train wouldn't see us till it got round the corner, and
then it could see the mound just as well as us," said Phyllis;
"better, because it's much bigger than us."</p>

<p>"If we only had something red," Peter repeated, "we could go
round the corner and wave to the train."</p>

<p>"We might wave, anyway."</p>

<p>"They'd only think it was just <i>us</i>, as usual. We've waved
so often before. Anyway, let's get down."</p>

<p>They got down the steep stairs. Bobbie was pale and shivering.
Peter's face looked thinner than usual. Phyllis was red-faced and
damp with anxiety.</p>

<p>"Oh, how hot I am!" she said; "and I thought it was going to be
cold; I wish we hadn't put on our&mdash;" she stopped short, and
then ended in quite a different tone&mdash;"our flannel
petticoats."</p>

<p>Bobbie turned at the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she cried; "<i>they're</i> red! Let's take them
off."</p>

<p>They did, and with the petticoats rolled up under their arms,
ran along the railway, skirting the newly fallen mound of stones
and rock and earth, and bent, crushed, twisted trees. They ran at
their best pace. Peter led, but the girls were not far behind. They
reached the corner that hid the mound from the straight line of
railway that ran half a mile without curve or corner.</p>

<p>"Now," said Peter, taking hold of the largest flannel
petticoat.</p>

<p>"You're not"&mdash;Phyllis faltered&mdash;"you're not going to
<i>tear</i> them?"</p>

<p>"Shut up," said Peter, with brief sternness.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Bobbie, "tear them into little bits if you like.
Don't you see, Phil, if we can't stop the train, there'll be a real
live accident, with people <i>killed</i>. Oh, horrible! Here,
Peter, you'll never tear it through the band!"</p>

<p>She took the red flannel petticoat from him and tore it off an
inch from the band. Then she tore the other in the same way.</p>

<p>"There!" said Peter, tearing in his turn. He divided each
petticoat into three pieces. "Now, we've got six flags." He looked
at the watch again. "And we've got seven minutes. We must have
flagstaffs."</p>

<p>The knives given to boys are, for some odd reason, seldom of the
kind of steel that keeps sharp. The young saplings had to be broken
off. Two came up by the roots. The leaves were stripped from
them.</p>

<p>"We must cut holes in the flags, and run the sticks through the
holes," said Peter. And the holes were cut. The knife was sharp
enough to cut flannel with. Two of the flags were set up in heaps
of loose stones between the sleepers of the down line. Then Phyllis
and Roberta took each a flag, and stood ready to wave it as soon as
the train came in sight.</p>

<p>"I shall have the other two myself," said Peter, "because it was
my idea to wave something red."</p>

<p>"They're our petticoats, though," Phyllis was beginning, but
Bobbie interrupted&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, what does it matter who waves what, if we can only save the
train?"</p>

<p>Perhaps Peter had not rightly calculated the number of minutes
it would take the 11.29 to get from the station to the place where
they were, or perhaps the train was late. Anyway, it seemed a very
long time that they waited.</p>

<p>Phyllis grew impatient. "I expect the watch is wrong, and the
train's gone by," said she.</p>

<p>Peter relaxed the heroic attitude he had chosen to show off his
two flags. And Bobbie began to feel sick with suspense.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that they had been standing there for hours and
hours, holding those silly little red flannel flags that no one
would ever notice. The train wouldn't care. It would go rushing by
them and tear round the corner and go crashing into that awful
mound. And everyone would be killed. Her hands grew very cold and
trembled so that she could hardly hold the flag. And then came the
distant rumble and hum of the metals, and a puff of white steam
showed far away along the stretch of line.</p>

<p>"Stand firm," said Peter, "and wave like mad! When it gets to
that big furze bush step back, but go on waving! Don't stand
<i>on</i> the line, Bobbie!"</p>

<p>The train came rattling along very, very fast.</p>

<p>"They don't see us! They won't see us! It's all no good!" cried
Bobbie.</p>

<p>The two little flags on the line swayed as the nearing train
shook and loosened the heaps of loose stones that held them up. One
of them slowly leaned over and fell on the line. Bobbie jumped
forward and caught it up, and waved it; her hands did not tremble
now.</p>

<p>It seemed that the train came on as fast as ever. It was very
near now.</p>

<p>"Keep off the line, you silly cuckoo!" said Peter, fiercely.</p>

<p>"It's no good," Bobbie said again.</p>

<p>"Stand back!" cried Peter, suddenly, and he dragged Phyllis back
by the arm.</p>

<p>But Bobbie cried, "Not yet, not yet!" and waved her two flags
right over the line. The front of the engine looked black and
enormous. It's voice was loud and harsh.</p>

<p>"Oh, stop, stop, stop!" cried Bobbie. No one heard her. At least
Peter and Phyllis didn't, for the oncoming rush of the train
covered the sound of her voice with a mountain of sound. But
afterwards she used to wonder whether the engine itself had not
heard her. It seemed almost as though it had&mdash;for it slackened
swiftly, slackened and stopped, not twenty yards from the place
where Bobbie's two flags waved over the line. She saw the great
black engine stop dead, but somehow she could not stop waving the
flags. And when the driver and the fireman had got off the engine
and Peter and Phyllis had gone to meet them and pour out their
excited tale of the awful mound just round the corner, Bobbie still
waved the flags but more and more feebly and jerkily.</p>

<p>When the others turned towards her she was lying across the line
with her hands flung forward and still gripping the sticks of the
little red flannel flags.</p>

<p>The engine-driver picked her up, carried her to the train, and
laid her on the cushions of a first-class carriage.</p>

<p>"Gone right off in a faint," he said, "poor little woman. And no
wonder. I'll just 'ave a look at this 'ere mound of yours, and then
we'll run you back to the station and get her seen to."</p>

<p>It was horrible to see Bobbie lying so white and quiet, with her
lips blue, and parted.</p>

<p>"I believe that's what people look like when they're dead,"
whispered Phyllis.</p>

<p>"<i>Don't</i>!" said Peter, sharply.</p>

<p>They sat by Bobbie on the blue cushions, and the train ran back.
Before it reached their station Bobbie had sighed and opened her
eyes, and rolled herself over and begun to cry. This cheered the
others wonderfully. They had seen her cry before, but they had
never seen her faint, nor anyone else, for the matter of that. They
had not known what to do when she was fainting, but now she was
only crying they could thump her on the back and tell her not to,
just as they always did. And presently, when she stopped crying,
they were able to laugh at her for being such a coward as to
faint.</p>

<p>When the station was reached, the three were the heroes of an
agitated meeting on the platform.</p>

<p>The praises they got for their "prompt action," their "common
sense," their "ingenuity," were enough to have turned anybody's
head. Phyllis enjoyed herself thoroughly. She had never been a real
heroine before, and the feeling was delicious. Peter's ears got
very red. Yet he, too, enjoyed himself. Only Bobbie wished they all
wouldn't. She wanted to get away.</p>

<p>"You'll hear from the Company about this, I expect," said the
Station Master.</p>

<p>Bobbie wished she might never hear of it again. She pulled at
Peter's jacket.</p>

<p>"Oh, come away, come away! I want to go home," she said.</p>

<p>So they went. And as they went Station Master and Porter and
guards and driver and fireman and passengers sent up a cheer.</p>

<p>"Oh, listen," cried Phyllis; "that's for <i>us</i>!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter. "I say, I am glad I thought about something
red, and waving it."</p>

<p>"How lucky we <i>did</i> put on our red flannel petticoats!"
said Phyllis.</p>

<p>Bobbie said nothing. She was thinking of the horrible mound, and
the trustful train rushing towards it.</p>

<p>"And it was <i>us</i> that saved them," said Peter.</p>

<p>"How dreadful if they had all been killed!" said Phyllis;
"wouldn't it, Bobbie?"</p>

<p>"We never got any cherries, after all," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>The others thought her rather heartless.</p>

<h2>Chapter VII. For valour.</h2>

<p>I hope you don't mind my telling you a good deal about Roberta.
The fact is I am growing very fond of her. The more I observe her
the more I love her. And I notice all sorts of things about her
that I like.</p>

<p>For instance, she was quite oddly anxious to make other people
happy. And she could keep a secret, a tolerably rare
accomplishment. Also she had the power of silent sympathy. That
sounds rather dull, I know, but it's not so dull as it sounds. It
just means that a person is able to know that you are unhappy, and
to love you extra on that account, without bothering you by telling
you all the time how sorry she is for you. That was what Bobbie was
like. She knew that Mother was unhappy&mdash;and that Mother had
not told her the reason. So she just loved Mother more and never
said a single word that could let Mother know how earnestly her
little girl wondered what Mother was unhappy about. This needs
practice. It is not so easy as you might think.</p>

<p>Whatever happened&mdash;and all sorts of nice, pleasant ordinary
things happened&mdash;such as picnics, games, and buns for tea,
Bobbie always had these thoughts at the back of her mind. "Mother's
unhappy. Why? I don't know. She doesn't want me to know. I won't
try to find out. But she <i>is</i> unhappy. Why? I don't know. She
doesn't&mdash;" and so on, repeating and repeating like a tune that
you don't know the stopping part of.</p>

<p>The Russian gentleman still took up a good deal of everybody's
thoughts. All the editors and secretaries of Societies and Members
of Parliament had answered Mother's letters as politely as they
knew how; but none of them could tell where the wife and children
of Mr. Szezcpansky would be likely to be. (Did I tell you that the
Russian's very Russian name was that?)</p>

<p>Bobbie had another quality which you will hear differently
described by different people. Some of them call it interfering in
other people's business&mdash;and some call it "helping lame dogs
over stiles," and some call it "loving-kindness." It just means
trying to help people.</p>

<p>She racked her brains to think of some way of helping the
Russian gentleman to find his wife and children. He had learned a
few words of English now. He could say "Good morning," and "Good
night," and "Please," and "Thank you," and "Pretty," when the
children brought him flowers, and "Ver' good," when they asked him
how he had slept.</p>

<p>The way he smiled when he "said his English," was, Bobbie felt,
"just too sweet for anything." She used to think of his face
because she fancied it would help her to some way of helping him.
But it did not. Yet his being there cheered her because she saw
that it made Mother happier.</p>

<p>"She likes to have someone to be good to, even beside us," said
Bobbie. "And I know she hated to let him have Father's clothes. But
I suppose it 'hurt nice,' or she wouldn't have."</p>

<p>For many and many a night after the day when she and Peter and
Phyllis had saved the train from wreck by waving their little red
flannel flags, Bobbie used to wake screaming and shivering, seeing
again that horrible mound, and the poor, dear trustful engine
rushing on towards it&mdash;just thinking that it was doing its
swift duty, and that everything was clear and safe. And then a warm
thrill of pleasure used to run through her at the remembrance of
how she and Peter and Phyllis and the red flannel petticoats had
really saved everybody.</p>

<p>One morning a letter came. It was addressed to Peter and Bobbie
and Phyllis. They opened it with enthusiastic curiosity, for they
did not often get letters.</p>

<p>The letter said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Dear Sir, and Ladies,&mdash;It is proposed to make a
small presentation to you, in commemoration of your prompt and
courageous action in warning the train on the &mdash; inst., and
thus averting what must, humanly speaking, have been a terrible
accident. The presentation will take place at the &mdash;&mdash;
Station at three o'clock on the 30th inst., if this time and place
will be convenient to you.<br>
<br>
"Yours faithfully,<br>
"Jabez Inglewood.<br>
"Secretary, Great Northern and Southern Railway Co."</blockquote>

<p>There never had been a prouder moment in the lives of the three
children. They rushed to Mother with the letter, and she also felt
proud and said so, and this made the children happier than
ever.</p>

<p>"But if the presentation is money, you must say, 'Thank you, but
we'd rather not take it,'" said Mother. "I'll wash your Indian
muslins at once," she added. "You must look tidy on an occasion
like this."</p>

<p>"Phil and I can wash them," said Bobbie, "if you'll iron them,
Mother."</p>

<p>Washing is rather fun. I wonder whether you've ever done it?
This particular washing took place in the back kitchen, which had a
stone floor and a very big stone sink under its window.</p>

<p>"Let's put the bath on the sink," said Phyllis; "then we can
pretend we're out-of-doors washerwomen like Mother saw in
France."</p>

<p>"But they were washing in the cold river," said Peter, his hands
in his pockets, "not in hot water."</p>

<p>"This is a <i>hot</i> river, then," said Phyllis; "lend a hand
with the bath, there's a dear."</p>

<p>"I should like to see a deer lending a hand," said Peter, but he
lent his.</p>

<p>"Now to rub and scrub and scrub and rub," said Phyllis, hopping
joyously about as Bobbie carefully carried the heavy kettle from
the kitchen fire.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Bobbie, greatly shocked; "you don't rub muslin.
You put the boiled soap in the hot water and make it all
frothy-lathery&mdash;and then you shake the muslin and squeeze it,
ever so gently, and all the dirt comes out. It's only clumsy things
like tablecloths and sheets that have to be rubbed."</p>

<p>The lilac and the Gloire de Dijon roses outside the window
swayed in the soft breeze.</p>

<p>"It's a nice drying day&mdash;that's one thing," said Bobbie,
feeling very grown up. "Oh, I do wonder what wonderful feelings we
shall have when we <i>wear</i> the Indian muslin dresses!"</p>

<p>"Yes, so do I," said Phyllis, shaking and squeezing the muslin
in quite a professional manner.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i> we squeeze out the soapy water. <i>No</i>&mdash;we
mustn't twist them&mdash;and then rinse them. I'll hold them while
you and Peter empty the bath and get clean water."</p>

<p>"A presentation! That means presents," said Peter, as his
sisters, having duly washed the pegs and wiped the line, hung up
the dresses to dry. "Whatever will it be?"</p>

<p>"It might be anything," said Phyllis; "what I've always wanted
is a Baby elephant&mdash;but I suppose they wouldn't know
that."</p>

<p>"Suppose it was gold models of steam-engines?" said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Or a big model of the scene of the prevented accident,"
suggested Peter, "with a little model train, and dolls dressed like
us and the engine-driver and fireman and passengers."</p>

<p>"Do you <i>like</i>," said Bobbie, doubtfully, drying her hands
on the rough towel that hung on a roller at the back of the
scullery door, "do you <i>like</i> us being rewarded for saving a
train?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Peter, downrightly; "and don't you try to come
it over us that you don't like it, too. Because I know you do."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bobbie, doubtfully, "I know I do. But oughtn't we to
be satisfied with just having done it, and not ask for anything
more?"</p>

<p>"Who did ask for anything more, silly?" said her brother;
"Victoria Cross soldiers don't <i>ask</i> for it; but they're glad
enough to get it all the same. Perhaps it'll be medals. Then, when
I'm very old indeed, I shall show them to my grandchildren and say,
'We only did our duty,' and they'll be awfully proud of me."</p>

<p>"You have to be married," warned Phyllis, "or you don't have any
grandchildren."</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall <i>have</i> to be married some day," said
Peter, "but it will be an awful bother having her round all the
time. I'd like to marry a lady who had trances, and only woke up
once or twice a year."</p>

<p>"Just to say you were the light of her life and then go to sleep
again. Yes. That wouldn't be bad," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"When <i>I</i> get married," said Phyllis, "I shall want him to
want me to be awake all the time, so that I can hear him say how
nice I am."</p>

<p>"I think it would be nice," said Bobbie, "to marry someone very
poor, and then you'd do all the work and he'd love you most
frightfully, and see the blue wood smoke curling up among the trees
from the domestic hearth as he came home from work every night. I
say&mdash;we've got to answer that letter and say that the time and
place <i>will</i> be convenient to us. There's the soap, Peter.
<i>We're</i> both as clean as clean. That pink box of writing paper
you had on your birthday, Phil."</p>

<p>It took some time to arrange what should be said. Mother had
gone back to her writing, and several sheets of pink paper with
scalloped gilt edges and green four-leaved shamrocks in the corner
were spoiled before the three had decided what to say. Then each
made a copy and signed it with its own name.</p>

<p>The threefold letter ran:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"Dear Mr. Jabez Inglewood,&mdash;Thank you very much.
We did not want to be rewarded but only to save the train, but we
are glad you think so and thank you very much. The time and place
you say will be quite convenient to us. Thank you very much.<br>
<br>
"Your affecate little friend,"</blockquote>

<p>Then came the name, and after it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>"P.S. Thank you very much."</blockquote>

<p>"Washing is much easier than ironing," said Bobbie, taking the
clean dry dresses off the line. "I do love to see things come
clean. Oh&mdash;I don't know how we shall wait till it's time to
know what presentation they're going to present!"</p>

<p>When at last&mdash;it seemed a very long time after&mdash;it was
<i>the</i> day, the three children went down to the station at the
proper time. And everything that happened was so odd that it seemed
like a dream. The Station Master came out to meet them&mdash;in his
best clothes, as Peter noticed at once&mdash;and led them into the
waiting room where once they had played the advertisement game. It
looked quite different now. A carpet had been put down&mdash;and
there were pots of roses on the mantelpiece and on the window
ledges&mdash;green branches stuck up, like holly and laurel are at
Christmas, over the framed advertisement of Cook's Tours and the
Beauties of Devon and the Paris Lyons Railway. There were quite a
number of people there besides the Porter&mdash;two or three ladies
in smart dresses, and quite a crowd of gentlemen in high hats and
frock coats&mdash;besides everybody who belonged to the station.
They recognized several people who had been in the train on the
red-flannel-petticoat day. Best of all their own old gentleman was
there, and his coat and hat and collar seemed more than ever
different from anyone else's. He shook hands with them and then
everybody sat down on chairs, and a gentleman in
spectacles&mdash;they found out afterwards that he was the District
Superintendent&mdash;began quite a long speech&mdash;very clever
indeed. I am not going to write the speech down. First, because you
would think it dull; and secondly, because it made all the children
blush so, and get so hot about the ears that I am quite anxious to
get away from this part of the subject; and thirdly, because the
gentleman took so many words to say what he had to say that I
really haven't time to write them down. He said all sorts of nice
things about the children's bravery and presence of mind, and when
he had done he sat down, and everyone who was there clapped and
said, "Hear, hear."</p>

<p>And then the old gentleman got up and said things, too. It was
very like a prize-giving. And then he called the children one by
one, by their names, and gave each of them a beautiful gold watch
and chain. And inside the watches were engraved after the name of
the watch's new owner:&mdash;</p>

<p>"From the Directors of the Northern and Southern Railway in
grateful recognition of the courageous and prompt action which
averted an accident on &mdash;&mdash; 1905."</p>

<p>The watches were the most beautiful you can possibly imagine,
and each one had a blue leather case to live in when it was at
home.</p>

<p>"You must make a speech now and thank everyone for their
kindness," whispered the Station Master in Peter's ear and pushed
him forward. "Begin 'Ladies and Gentlemen,'" he added.</p>

<p>Each of the children had already said "Thank you," quite
properly.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," said Peter, but he did not resist the push.</p>

<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen," he said in a rather husky voice. Then
there was a pause, and he heard his heart beating in his throat.
"Ladies and Gentlemen," he went on with a rush, "it's most awfully
good of you, and we shall treasure the watches all our
lives&mdash;but really we don't deserve it because what we did
wasn't anything, really. At least, I mean it was awfully exciting,
and what I mean to say&mdash;thank you all very, very much."</p>

<p>The people clapped Peter more than they had done the District
Superintendent, and then everybody shook hands with them, and as
soon as politeness would let them, they got away, and tore up the
hill to Three Chimneys with their watches in their hands.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful day&mdash;the kind of day that very seldom
happens to anybody and to most of us not at all.</p>

<p>"I did want to talk to the old gentleman about something else,"
said Bobbie, "but it was so public&mdash;like being in church."</p>

<p>"What did you want to say?" asked Phyllis.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when I've thought about it more," said
Bobbie.</p>

<p>So when she had thought a little more she wrote a letter.</p>

<blockquote>"My dearest old gentleman," it said; "I want most
awfully to ask you something. If you could get out of the train and
go by the next, it would do. I do not want you to give me anything.
Mother says we ought not to. And besides, we do not want any
<i>things</i>. Only to talk to you about a Prisoner and Captive.
Your loving little friend,<br>
<br>
"Bobbie."</blockquote>

<p>She got the Station Master to give the letter to the old
gentleman, and next day she asked Peter and Phyllis to come down to
the station with her at the time when the train that brought the
old gentleman from town would be passing through.</p>

<p>She explained her idea to them&mdash;and they approved
thoroughly.</p>

<p>They had all washed their hands and faces, and brushed their
hair, and were looking as tidy as they knew how. But Phyllis,
always unlucky, had upset a jug of lemonade down the front of her
dress. There was no time to change&mdash;and the wind happening to
blow from the coal yard, her frock was soon powdered with grey,
which stuck to the sticky lemonade stains and made her look, as
Peter said, "like any little gutter child."</p>

<p>It was decided that she should keep behind the others as much as
possible.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the old gentleman won't notice," said Bobbie. "The aged
are often weak in the eyes."</p>

<p>There was no sign of weakness, however, in the eyes, or in any
other part of the old gentleman, as he stepped from the train and
looked up and down the platform.</p>

<p>The three children, now that it came to the point, suddenly felt
that rush of deep shyness which makes your ears red and hot, your
hands warm and wet, and the tip of your nose pink and shiny.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Phyllis, "my heart's thumping like a
steam-engine&mdash;right under my sash, too."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Peter, "people's hearts aren't under their
sashes."</p>

<p>"I don't care&mdash;mine is," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"If you're going to talk like a poetry-book," said Peter, "my
heart's in my mouth."</p>

<p>"My heart's in my boots&mdash;if you come to that," said
Roberta; "but do come on&mdash;he'll think we're idiots."</p>

<p>"He won't be far wrong," said Peter, gloomily. And they went
forward to meet the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Hullo," he said, shaking hands with them all in turn. "This is
a very great pleasure."</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> good of you to get out," Bobbie said, perspiring
and polite.</p>

<p>He took her arm and drew her into the waiting room where she and
the others had played the advertisement game the day they found the
Russian. Phyllis and Peter followed. "Well?" said the old
gentleman, giving Bobbie's arm a kind little shake before he let it
go. "Well? What is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, please!" said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"What I mean to say&mdash;" said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"It's all very nice and kind," said she.</p>

<p>"But?" he said.</p>

<p>"I wish I might say something," she said.</p>

<p>"Say it," said he.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Bobbie&mdash;and out came the story of the
Russian who had written the beautiful book about poor people, and
had been sent to prison and to Siberia for just that.</p>

<p>"And what we want more than anything in the world is to find his
wife and children for him," said Bobbie, "but we don't know how.
But you must be most horribly clever, or you wouldn't be a
Direction of the Railway. And if <i>you</i> knew how&mdash;and
would? We'd rather have that than anything else in the world. We'd
go without the watches, even, if you could sell them and find his
wife with the money."</p>

<p>And the others said so, too, though not with so much
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Hum," said the old gentleman, pulling down the white waistcoat
that had the big gilt buttons on it, "what did you say the name
was&mdash; Fryingpansky?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Bobbie earnestly. "I'll write it down for you. It
doesn't really look at all like that except when you say it. Have
you a bit of pencil and the back of an envelope?" she asked.</p>

<p>The old gentleman got out a gold pencil-case and a beautiful,
sweet-smelling, green Russian leather note-book and opened it at a
new page.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, "write here."</p>

<p>She wrote down "Szezcpansky," and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's how you write it. You <i>call</i> it Shepansky."</p>

<p>The old gentleman took out a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles and
fitted them on his nose. When he had read the name, he looked quite
different.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> man? Bless my soul!" he said. "Why, I've read his
book! It's translated into every European language. A fine
book&mdash;a noble book. And so your mother took him in&mdash;like
the good Samaritan. Well, well. I'll tell you what,
youngsters&mdash;your mother must be a very good woman."</p>

<p>"Of course she is," said Phyllis, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"And you're a very good man," said Bobbie, very shy, but firmly
resolved to be polite.</p>

<p>"You flatter me," said the old gentleman, taking off his hat
with a flourish. "And now am I to tell you what I think of
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't," said Bobbie, hastily.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"I don't exactly know," said Bobbie. "Only&mdash;if it's horrid,
I don't want you to; and if it's nice, I'd rather you didn't."</p>

<p>The old gentleman laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, then," he said, "I'll only just say that I'm very glad
you came to me about this&mdash;very glad, indeed. And I shouldn't
be surprised if I found out something very soon. I know a great
many Russians in London, and every Russian knows <i>his</i> name.
Now tell me all about yourselves."</p>

<p>He turned to the others, but there was only one other, and that
was Peter. Phyllis had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about yourself," said the old gentleman again. And,
quite naturally, Peter was stricken dumb.</p>

<p>"All right, we'll have an examination," said the old gentleman;
"you two sit on the table, and I'll sit on the bench and ask
questions."</p>

<p>He did, and out came their names and ages&mdash;their Father's
name and business&mdash;how long they had lived at Three Chimneys
and a great deal more.</p>

<p>The questions were beginning to turn on a herring and a half for
three halfpence, and a pound of lead and a pound of feathers, when
the door of the waiting room was kicked open by a boot; as the boot
entered everyone could see that its lace was coming
undone&mdash;and in came Phyllis, very slowly and carefully.</p>

<p>In one hand she carried a large tin can, and in the other a
thick slice of bread and butter.</p>

<p>"Afternoon tea," she announced proudly, and held the can and the
bread and butter out to the old gentleman, who took them and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bless my soul!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"It's very thoughtful of you," said the old gentleman,
"very."</p>

<p>"But you might have got a cup," said Bobbie, "and a plate."</p>

<p>"Perks always drinks out of the can," said Phyllis, flushing
red. "I think it was very nice of him to give it me at
all&mdash;let alone cups and plates," she added.</p>

<p>"So do I," said the old gentleman, and he drank some of the tea
and tasted the bread and butter.</p>

<p>And then it was time for the next train, and he got into it with
many good-byes and kind last words.</p>

<p>"Well," said Peter, when they were left on the platform, and the
tail-lights of the train disappeared round the corner, "it's my
belief that we've lighted a candle to-day&mdash;like Latimer, you
know, when he was being burned&mdash;and there'll be fireworks for
our Russian before long."</p>

<p>And so there were.</p>

<p>It wasn't ten days after the interview in the waiting room that
the three children were sitting on the top of the biggest rock in
the field below their house watching the 5.15 steam away from the
station along the bottom of the valley. They saw, too, the few
people who had got out at the station straggling up the road
towards the village&mdash;and they saw one person leave the road
and open the gate that led across the fields to Three Chimneys and
to nowhere else.</p>

<p>"Who on earth!" said Peter, scrambling down.</p>

<p>"Let's go and see," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>So they did. And when they got near enough to see who the person
was, they saw it was their old gentleman himself, his brass buttons
winking in the afternoon sunshine, and his white waistcoat looking
whiter than ever against the green of the field.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" shouted the children, waving their hands.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" shouted the old gentleman, waving his hat.</p>

<p>Then the three started to run&mdash;and when they got to him
they hardly had breath left to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"How do you do?"</p>

<p>"Good news," said he. "I've found your Russian friend's wife and
child&mdash;and I couldn't resist the temptation of giving myself
the pleasure of telling him."</p>

<p>But as he looked at Bobbie's face he felt that he <i>could</i>
resist that temptation.</p>

<p>"Here," he said to her, "you run on and tell him. The other two
will show me the way."</p>

<p>Bobbie ran. But when she had breathlessly panted out the news to
the Russian and Mother sitting in the quiet garden&mdash;when
Mother's face had lighted up so beautifully, and she had said half
a dozen quick French words to the Exile&mdash;Bobbie wished that
she had <i>not</i> carried the news. For the Russian sprang up with
a cry that made Bobbie's heart leap and then tremble&mdash;a cry of
love and longing such as she had never heard. Then he took Mother's
hand and kissed it gently and reverently&mdash;and then he sank
down in his chair and covered his face with his hands and sobbed.
Bobbie crept away. She did not want to see the others just
then.</p>

<p>But she was as gay as anybody when the endless French talking
was over, when Peter had torn down to the village for buns and
cakes, and the girls had got tea ready and taken it out into the
garden.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was most merry and delightful. He seemed to be
able to talk in French and English almost at the same moment, and
Mother did nearly as well. It was a delightful time. Mother seemed
as if she could not make enough fuss about the old gentleman, and
she said yes at once when he asked if he might present some
"goodies" to his little friends.</p>

<p>The word was new to the children&mdash;but they guessed that it
meant sweets, for the three large pink and green boxes, tied with
green ribbon, which he took out of his bag, held unheard-of layers
of beautiful chocolates.</p>

<p>The Russian's few belongings were packed, and they all saw him
off at the station.</p>

<p>Then Mother turned to the old gentleman and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't know how to thank you for <i>everything</i>. It has
been a real pleasure to me to see you. But we live very quietly. I
am so sorry that I can't ask you to come and see us again."</p>

<p>The children thought this very hard. When they <i>had</i> made a
friend&mdash; and such a friend&mdash;they would dearly have liked
him to come and see them again.</p>

<p>What the old gentleman thought they couldn't tell. He only
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I consider myself very fortunate, Madam, to have been received
once at your house."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mother, "I know I must seem surly and
ungrateful&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You could never seem anything but a most charming and gracious
lady," said the old gentleman, with another of his bows.</p>

<p>And as they turned to go up the hill, Bobbie saw her Mother's
face.</p>

<p>"How tired you look, Mammy," she said; "lean on me."</p>

<p>"It's my place to give Mother my arm," said Peter. "I'm the head
man of the family when Father's away."</p>

<p>Mother took an arm of each.</p>

<p>"How awfully nice," said Phyllis, skipping joyfully, "to think
of the dear Russian embracing his long-lost wife. The baby must
have grown a lot since he saw it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mother.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether Father will think <i>I've</i> grown," Phyllis
went on, skipping still more gaily. "I have grown already, haven't
I, Mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mother, "oh, yes," and Bobbie and Peter felt her
hands tighten on their arms.</p>

<p>"Poor old Mammy, you <i>are</i> tired," said Peter.</p>

<p>Bobbie said, "Come on, Phil; I'll race you to the gate."</p>

<p>And she started the race, though she hated doing it. <i>You</i>
know why Bobbie did that. Mother only thought that Bobbie was tired
of walking slowly. Even Mothers, who love you better than anyone
else ever will, don't always understand.</p>

<h2>Chapter VIII. The amateur firemen.</h2>

<p>"That's a likely little brooch you've got on, Miss," said Perks
the Porter; "I don't know as ever I see a thing more like a
buttercup without it <i>was</i> a buttercup."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bobbie, glad and flushed by this approval. "I always
thought it was more like a buttercup almost than even a real
one&mdash; and I <i>never</i> thought it would come to be mine, my
very own&mdash;and then Mother gave it to me for my birthday."</p>

<p>"Oh, have you had a birthday?" said Perks; and he seemed quite
surprised, as though a birthday were a thing only granted to a
favoured few.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bobbie; "when's your birthday, Mr. Perks?" The
children were taking tea with Mr. Perks in the Porters' room among
the lamps and the railway almanacs. They had brought their own cups
and some jam turnovers. Mr. Perks made tea in a beer can, as usual,
and everyone felt very happy and confidential.</p>

<p>"My birthday?" said Perks, tipping some more dark brown tea out
of the can into Peter's cup. "I give up keeping of my birthday
afore you was born."</p>

<p>"But you must have been born <i>sometime</i>, you know," said
Phyllis, thoughtfully, "even if it was twenty years ago&mdash;or
thirty or sixty or seventy."</p>

<p>"Not so long as that, Missie," Perks grinned as he answered. "If
you really want to know, it was thirty-two years ago, come the
fifteenth of this month."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you keep it?" asked Phyllis.</p>

<p>"I've got something else to keep besides birthdays," said Perks,
briefly.</p>

<p>"Oh! What?" asked Phyllis, eagerly. "Not secrets?"</p>

<p>"No," said Perks, "the kids and the Missus."</p>

<p>It was this talk that set the children thinking, and, presently,
talking. Perks was, on the whole, the dearest friend they had made.
Not so grand as the Station Master, but more
approachable&mdash;less powerful than the old gentleman, but more
confidential.</p>

<p>"It seems horrid that nobody keeps his birthday," said Bobbie.
"Couldn't <i>we</i> do something?"</p>

<p>"Let's go up to the Canal bridge and talk it over," said Peter.
"I got a new gut line from the postman this morning. He gave it me
for a bunch of roses that I gave him for his sweetheart. She's
ill."</p>

<p>"Then I do think you might have given her the roses for
nothing," said Bobbie, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Nyang, nyang!" said Peter, disagreeably, and put his hands in
his pockets.</p>

<p>"He did, of course," said Phyllis, in haste; "directly we heard
she was ill we got the roses ready and waited by the gate. It was
when you were making the brekker-toast. And when he'd said 'Thank
you' for the roses so many times&mdash;much more than he need
have&mdash;he pulled out the line and gave it to Peter. It wasn't
exchange. It was the grateful heart."</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>beg</i> your pardon, Peter," said Bobbie, "I <i>am</i>
so sorry."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it," said Peter, grandly, "I knew you would
be."</p>

<p>So then they all went up to the Canal bridge. The idea was to
fish from the bridge, but the line was not quite long enough.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Bobbie. "Let's just stay here and look at
things. Everything's so beautiful."</p>

<p>It was. The sun was setting in red splendour over the grey and
purple hills, and the canal lay smooth and shiny in the
shadow&mdash;no ripple broke its surface. It was like a grey satin
ribbon between the dusky green silk of the meadows that were on
each side of its banks.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Peter, "but somehow I can always see how
pretty things are much better when I've something to do. Let's get
down on to the towpath and fish from there."</p>

<p>Phyllis and Bobbie remembered how the boys on the canal-boats
had thrown coal at them, and they said so.</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense," said Peter. "There aren't any boys here now. If
there were, I'd fight them."</p>

<p>Peter's sisters were kind enough not to remind him how he had
<i>not</i> fought the boys when coal had last been thrown. Instead
they said, "All right, then," and cautiously climbed down the steep
bank to the towing-path. The line was carefully baited, and for
half an hour they fished patiently and in vain. Not a single nibble
came to nourish hope in their hearts.</p>

<p>All eyes were intent on the sluggish waters that earnestly
pretended they had never harboured a single minnow when a loud
rough shout made them start.</p>

<p>"Hi!" said the shout, in most disagreeable tones, "get out of
that, can't you?"</p>

<p>An old white horse coming along the towing-path was within half
a dozen yards of them. They sprang to their feet and hastily
climbed up the bank.</p>

<p>"We'll slip down again when they've gone by," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>But, alas, the barge, after the manner of barges, stopped under
the bridge.</p>

<p>"She's going to anchor," said Peter; "just our luck!"</p>

<p>The barge did not anchor, because an anchor is not part of a
canal-boat's furniture, but she was moored with ropes fore and
aft&mdash;and the ropes were made fast to the palings and to
crowbars driven into the ground.</p>

<p>"What you staring at?" growled the Bargee, crossly.</p>

<p>"We weren't staring," said Bobbie; "we wouldn't be so rude."</p>

<p>"Rude be blessed," said the man; "get along with you!"</p>

<p>"Get along yourself," said Peter. He remembered what he had said
about fighting boys, and, besides, he felt safe halfway up the
bank. "We've as much right here as anyone else."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>'ave</i> you, indeed!" said the man. "We'll soon see
about that." And he came across his deck and began to climb down
the side of his barge.</p>

<p>"Oh, come away, Peter, come away!" said Bobbie and Phyllis, in
agonised unison.</p>

<p>"Not me," said Peter, "but <i>you'd</i> better."</p>

<p>The girls climbed to the top of the bank and stood ready to bolt
for home as soon as they saw their brother out of danger. The way
home lay all down hill. They knew that they all ran well. The
Bargee did not look as if <i>he</i> did. He was red-faced, heavy,
and beefy.</p>

<p>But as soon as his foot was on the towing-path the children saw
that they had misjudged him.</p>

<p>He made one spring up the bank and caught Peter by the leg,
dragged him down&mdash;set him on his feet with a shake&mdash;took
him by the ear&mdash;and said sternly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, then, what do you mean by it? Don't you know these 'ere
waters is preserved? You ain't no right catching fish
'ere&mdash;not to say nothing of your precious cheek."</p>

<p>Peter was always proud afterwards when he remembered that, with
the Bargee's furious fingers tightening on his ear, the Bargee's
crimson countenance close to his own, the Bargee's hot breath on
his neck, he had the courage to speak the truth.</p>

<p>"I <i>wasn't</i> catching fish," said Peter.</p>

<p>"That's not <i>your</i> fault, I'll be bound," said the man,
giving Peter's ear a twist&mdash;not a hard one&mdash;but still a
twist.</p>

<p>Peter could not say that it was. Bobbie and Phyllis had been
holding on to the railings above and skipping with anxiety. Now
suddenly Bobbie slipped through the railings and rushed down the
bank towards Peter, so impetuously that Phyllis, following more
temperately, felt certain that her sister's descent would end in
the waters of the canal. And so it would have done if the Bargee
hadn't let go of Peter's ear&mdash;and caught her in his jerseyed
arm.</p>

<p>"Who are you a-shoving of?" he said, setting her on her
feet.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Bobbie, breathless, "I'm not shoving anybody. At
least, not on purpose. Please don't be cross with Peter. Of course,
if it's your canal, we're sorry and we won't any more. But we
didn't know it was yours."</p>

<p>"Go along with you," said the Bargee.</p>

<p>"Yes, we will; indeed we will," said Bobbie, earnestly; "but we
do beg your pardon&mdash;and really we haven't caught a single
fish. I'd tell you directly if we had, honour bright I would."</p>

<p>She held out her hands and Phyllis turned out her little empty
pocket to show that really they hadn't any fish concealed about
them.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Bargee, more gently, "cut along, then, and
don't you do it again, that's all."</p>

<p>The children hurried up the bank.</p>

<p>"Chuck us a coat, M'ria," shouted the man. And a red-haired
woman in a green plaid shawl came out from the cabin door with a
baby in her arms and threw a coat to him. He put it on, climbed the
bank, and slouched along across the bridge towards the village.</p>

<p>"You'll find me up at the 'Rose and Crown' when you've got the
kid to sleep," he called to her from the bridge.</p>

<p>When he was out of sight the children slowly returned. Peter
insisted on this.</p>

<p>"The canal may belong to him," he said, "though I don't believe
it does. But the bridge is everybody's. Doctor Forrest told me it's
public property. I'm not going to be bounced off the bridge by him
or anyone else, so I tell you."</p>

<p>Peter's ear was still sore and so were his feelings.</p>

<p>The girls followed him as gallant soldiers might follow the
leader of a forlorn hope.</p>

<p>"I do wish you wouldn't," was all they said.</p>

<p>"Go home if you're afraid," said Peter; "leave me alone. I'M not
afraid."</p>

<p>The sound of the man's footsteps died away along the quiet road.
The peace of the evening was not broken by the notes of the
sedge-warblers or by the voice of the woman in the barge, singing
her baby to sleep. It was a sad song she sang. Something about Bill
Bailey and how she wanted him to come home.</p>

<p>The children stood leaning their arms on the parapet of the
bridge; they were glad to be quiet for a few minutes because all
three hearts were beating much more quickly.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to be driven away by any old bargeman, I'm not,"
said Peter, thickly.</p>

<p>"Of course not," Phyllis said soothingly; "you didn't give in to
him! So now we might go home, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"<i>No</i>," said Peter.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said till the woman got off the barge, climbed
the bank, and came across the bridge.</p>

<p>She hesitated, looking at the three backs of the children, then
she said, "Ahem."</p>

<p>Peter stayed as he was, but the girls looked round.</p>

<p>"You mustn't take no notice of my Bill," said the woman; "'is
bark's worse'n 'is bite. Some of the kids down Farley way is fair
terrors. It was them put 'is back up calling out about who ate the
puppy-pie under Marlow bridge."</p>

<p>"Who <i>did</i>?" asked Phyllis.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> dunno," said the woman. "Nobody don't know! But
somehow, and I don't know the why nor the wherefore of it, them
words is p'ison to a barge-master. Don't you take no notice. 'E
won't be back for two hours good. You might catch a power o' fish
afore that. The light's good an' all," she added.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Bobbie. "You're very kind. Where's your
baby?"</p>

<p>"Asleep in the cabin," said the woman. "'E's all right. Never
wakes afore twelve. Reg'lar as a church clock, 'e is."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Bobbie; "I would have liked to see him, close
to."</p>

<p>"And a finer you never did see, Miss, though I says it." The
woman's face brightened as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid to leave it?" said Peter.</p>

<p>"Lor' love you, no," said the woman; "who'd hurt a little thing
like 'im? Besides, Spot's there. So long!"</p>

<p>The woman went away.</p>

<p>"Shall we go home?" said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"You can. I'm going to fish," said Peter briefly.</p>

<p>"I thought we came up here to talk about Perks's birthday," said
Phyllis.</p>

<p>"Perks's birthday'll keep."</p>

<p>So they got down on the towing-path again and Peter fished. He
did not catch anything.</p>

<p>It was almost quite dark, the girls were getting tired, and as
Bobbie said, it was past bedtime, when suddenly Phyllis cried,
"What's that?"</p>

<p>And she pointed to the canal boat. Smoke was coming from the
chimney of the cabin, had indeed been curling softly into the soft
evening air all the time&mdash;but now other wreaths of smoke were
rising, and these were from the cabin door.</p>

<p>"It's on fire&mdash;that's all," said Peter, calmly. "Serve him
right."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;how <i>can</i> you?" cried Phyllis. "Think of the poor
dear dog."</p>

<p>"The <i>baby</i>!" screamed Bobbie.</p>

<p>In an instant all three made for the barge.</p>

<p>Her mooring ropes were slack, and the little breeze, hardly
strong enough to be felt, had yet been strong enough to drift her
stern against the bank. Bobbie was first&mdash;then came Peter, and
it was Peter who slipped and fell. He went into the canal up to his
neck, and his feet could not feel the bottom, but his arm was on
the edge of the barge. Phyllis caught at his hair. It hurt, but it
helped him to get out. Next minute he had leaped on to the barge,
Phyllis following.</p>

<p>"Not you!" he shouted to Bobbie; "<i>me</i>, because I'm
wet."</p>

<p>He caught up with Bobbie at the cabin door, and flung her aside
very roughly indeed; if they had been playing, such roughness would
have made Bobbie weep with tears of rage and pain. Now, though he
flung her on to the edge of the hold, so that her knee and her
elbow were grazed and bruised, she only cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not you&mdash;<i>me</i>," and struggled up again. But
not quickly enough.</p>

<p>Peter had already gone down two of the cabin steps into the
cloud of thick smoke. He stopped, remembered all he had ever heard
of fires, pulled his soaked handkerchief out of his breast pocket
and tied it over his mouth. As he pulled it out he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's all right, hardly any fire at all."</p>

<p>And this, though he thought it was a lie, was rather good of
Peter. It was meant to keep Bobbie from rushing after him into
danger. Of course it didn't.</p>

<p>The cabin glowed red. A paraffin lamp was burning calmly in an
orange mist.</p>

<p>"Hi," said Peter, lifting the handkerchief from his mouth for a
moment. "Hi, Baby&mdash;where are you?" He choked.</p>

<p>"Oh, let <i>me</i> go," cried Bobbie, close behind him. Peter
pushed her back more roughly than before, and went on.</p>

<p>Now what would have happened if the baby hadn't cried I don't
know&mdash; but just at that moment it <i>did</i> cry. Peter felt
his way through the dark smoke, found something small and soft and
warm and alive, picked it up and backed out, nearly tumbling over
Bobbie who was close behind. A dog snapped at his leg&mdash;tried
to bark, choked.</p>

<p>"I've got the kid," said Peter, tearing off the handkerchief and
staggering on to the deck.</p>

<p>Bobbie caught at the place where the bark came from, and her
hands met on the fat back of a smooth-haired dog. It turned and
fastened its teeth on her hand, but very gently, as much as to
say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm bound to bark and bite if strangers come into my master's
cabin, but I know you mean well, so I won't <i>really</i>
bite."</p>

<p>Bobbie dropped the dog.</p>

<p>"All right, old man. Good dog," said she. "Here&mdash;give me
the baby, Peter; you're so wet you'll give it cold."</p>

<p>Peter was only too glad to hand over the strange little bundle
that squirmed and whimpered in his arms.</p>

<p>"Now," said Bobbie, quickly, "you run straight to the 'Rose and
Crown' and tell them. Phil and I will stay here with the precious.
Hush, then, a dear, a duck, a darling! Go <i>now</i>, Peter!
Run!"</p>

<p>"I can't run in these things," said Peter, firmly; "they're as
heavy as lead. I'll walk."</p>

<p>"Then <i>I'll</i> run," said Bobbie. "Get on the bank, Phil, and
I'll hand you the dear."</p>

<p>The baby was carefully handed. Phyllis sat down on the bank and
tried to hush the baby. Peter wrung the water from his sleeves and
knickerbocker legs as well as he could, and it was Bobbie who ran
like the wind across the bridge and up the long white quiet
twilight road towards the 'Rose and Crown.'</p>

<p>There is a nice old-fashioned room at the 'Rose and Crown; where
Bargees and their wives sit of an evening drinking their supper
beer, and toasting their supper cheese at a glowing basketful of
coals that sticks out into the room under a great hooded chimney
and is warmer and prettier and more comforting than any other
fireplace <i>I</i> ever saw.</p>

<p>There was a pleasant party of barge people round the fire. You
might not have thought it pleasant, but they did; for they were all
friends or acquaintances, and they liked the same sort of things,
and talked the same sort of talk. This is the real secret of
pleasant society. The Bargee Bill, whom the children had found so
disagreeable, was considered excellent company by his mates. He was
telling a tale of his own wrongs&mdash;always a thrilling subject.
It was his barge he was speaking about.</p>

<p>"And 'e sent down word 'paint her inside hout,' not namin' no
colour, d'ye see? So I gets a lotter green paint and I paints her
stem to stern, and I tell yer she looked A1. Then 'E comes along
and 'e says, 'Wot yer paint 'er all one colour for?' 'e says. And I
says, says I, 'Cause I thought she'd look fust-rate,' says I, 'and
I think so still.' An' he says, '<i>dew</i> yer? Then ye can just
pay for the bloomin' paint yerself,' says he. An' I 'ad to, too." A
murmur of sympathy ran round the room. Breaking noisily in on it
came Bobbie. She burst open the swing door&mdash;crying
breathlessly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bill! I want Bill the Bargeman."</p>

<p>There was a stupefied silence. Pots of beer were held in
mid-air, paralysed on their way to thirsty mouths.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Bobbie, seeing the bargewoman and making for her.
"Your barge cabin's on fire. Go quickly."</p>

<p>The woman started to her feet, and put a big red hand to her
waist, on the left side, where your heart seems to be when you are
frightened or miserable.</p>

<p>"Reginald Horace!" she cried in a terrible voice; "my Reginald
Horace!"</p>

<p>"All right," said Bobbie, "if you mean the baby; got him out
safe. Dog, too." She had no breath for more, except, "Go
on&mdash;it's all alight."</p>

<p>Then she sank on the ale-house bench and tried to get that
breath of relief after running which people call the 'second wind.'
But she felt as though she would never breathe again.</p>

<p>Bill the Bargee rose slowly and heavily. But his wife was a
hundred yards up the road before he had quite understood what was
the matter.</p>

<p>Phyllis, shivering by the canal side, had hardly heard the quick
approaching feet before the woman had flung herself on the railing,
rolled down the bank, and snatched the baby from her.</p>

<p>"Don't," said Phyllis, reproachfully; "I'd just got him to
sleep."</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Bill came up later talking in a language with which the children
were wholly unfamiliar. He leaped on to the barge and dipped up
pails of water. Peter helped him and they put out the fire.
Phyllis, the bargewoman, and the baby&mdash;and presently Bobbie,
too&mdash; cuddled together in a heap on the bank.</p>

<p>"Lord help me, if it was me left anything as could catch
alight," said the woman again and again.</p>

<p>But it wasn't she. It was Bill the Bargeman, who had knocked his
pipe out and the red ash had fallen on the hearth-rug and
smouldered there and at last broken into flame. Though a stern man
he was just. He did not blame his wife for what was his own fault,
as many bargemen, and other men, too, would have done.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Mother was half wild with anxiety when at last the three
children turned up at Three Chimneys, all very wet by now, for
Peter seemed to have come off on the others. But when she had
disentangled the truth of what had happened from their mixed and
incoherent narrative, she owned that they had done quite right, and
could not possibly have done otherwise. Nor did she put any
obstacles in the way of their accepting the cordial invitation with
which the bargeman had parted from them.</p>

<p>"Ye be here at seven to-morrow," he had said, "and I'll take you
the entire trip to Farley and back, so I will, and not a penny to
pay. Nineteen locks!"</p>

<p>They did not know what locks were; but they were at the bridge
at seven, with bread and cheese and half a soda cake, and quite a
quarter of a leg of mutton in a basket.</p>

<p>It was a glorious day. The old white horse strained at the
ropes, the barge glided smoothly and steadily through the still
water. The sky was blue overhead. Mr. Bill was as nice as anyone
could possibly be. No one would have thought that he could be the
same man who had held Peter by the ear. As for Mrs. Bill, she had
always been nice, as Bobbie said, and so had the baby, and even
Spot, who might have bitten them quite badly if he had liked.</p>

<p>"It was simply ripping, Mother," said Peter, when they reached
home very happy, very tired, and very dirty, "right over that
glorious aqueduct. And locks&mdash;you don't know what they're
like. You sink into the ground and then, when you feel you're never
going to stop going down, two great black gates open slowly,
slowly&mdash;you go out, and there you are on the canal just like
you were before."</p>

<p>"I know," said Mother, "there are locks on the Thames. Father
and I used to go on the river at Marlow before we were
married."</p>

<p>"And the dear, darling, ducky baby," said Bobbie; "it let me
nurse it for ages and ages&mdash;and it <i>was</i> so good. Mother,
I wish we had a baby to play with."</p>

<p>"And everybody was so nice to us," said Phyllis, "everybody we
met. And they say we may fish whenever we like. And Bill is going
to show us the way next time he's in these parts. He says we don't
know really."</p>

<p>"He said <i>you</i> didn't know," said Peter; "but, Mother, he
said he'd tell all the bargees up and down the canal that we were
the real, right sort, and they were to treat us like good pals, as
we were."</p>

<p>"So then I said," Phyllis interrupted, "we'd always each wear a
red ribbon when we went fishing by the canal, so they'd know it was
<i>us</i>, and we were the real, right sort, and be nice to
us!"</p>

<p>"So you've made another lot of friends," said Mother; "first the
railway and then the canal!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Bobbie; "I think everyone in the world is
friends if you can only get them to see you don't want to be
<i>un</i>-friends."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right," said Mother; and she sighed. "Come,
Chicks. It's bedtime."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Phyllis. "Oh dear&mdash;and we went up there to talk
about what we'd do for Perks's birthday. And we haven't talked a
single thing about it!"</p>

<p>"No more we have," said Bobbie; "but Peter's saved Reginald
Horace's life. I think that's about good enough for one
evening."</p>

<p>"Bobbie would have saved him if I hadn't knocked her down; twice
I did," said Peter, loyally.</p>

<p>"So would I," said Phyllis, "if I'd known what to do."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mother, "you've saved a little child's life. I do
think that's enough for one evening. Oh, my darlings, thank God
<i>you're</i> all safe!"</p>

<h2>Chapter IX. The pride of Perks.</h2>

<p>It was breakfast-time. Mother's face was very bright as she
poured the milk and ladled out the porridge.</p>

<p>"I've sold another story, Chickies," she said; "the one about
the King of the Mussels, so there'll be buns for tea. You can go
and get them as soon as they're baked. About eleven, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Peter, Phyllis, and Bobbie exchanged glances with each other,
six glances in all. Then Bobbie said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mother, would you mind if we didn't have the buns for tea
to-night, but on the fifteenth? That's next Thursday."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't mind when you have them, dear," said Mother,
"but why?"</p>

<p>"Because it's Perks's birthday," said Bobbie; "he's thirty-two,
and he says he doesn't keep his birthday any more, because he's got
other things to keep&mdash;not rabbits or secrets&mdash;but the
kids and the missus."</p>

<p>"You mean his wife and children," said Mother.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Phyllis; "it's the same thing, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"And we thought we'd make a nice birthday for him. He's been so
awfully jolly decent to us, you know, Mother," said Peter, "and we
agreed that next bun-day we'd ask you if we could."</p>

<p>"But suppose there hadn't been a bun-day before the fifteenth?"
said Mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, then, we meant to ask you to let us anti&mdash;antipate it,
and go without when the bun-day came."</p>

<p>"Anticipate," said Mother. "I see. Certainly. It would be nice
to put his name on the buns with pink sugar, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Perks," said Peter, "it's not a pretty name."</p>

<p>"His other name's Albert," said Phyllis; "I asked him once."</p>

<p>"We might put A. P.," said Mother; "I'll show you how when the
day comes."</p>

<p>This was all very well as far as it went. But even fourteen
halfpenny buns with A. P. on them in pink sugar do not of
themselves make a very grand celebration.</p>

<p>"There are always flowers, of course," said Bobbie, later, when
a really earnest council was being held on the subject in the
hay-loft where the broken chaff-cutting machine was, and the row of
holes to drop hay through into the hay-racks over the mangers of
the stables below.</p>

<p>"He's got lots of flowers of his own," said Peter.</p>

<p>"But it's always nice to have them given you," said Bobbie,
"however many you've got of your own. We can use flowers for
trimmings to the birthday. But there must be something to trim
besides buns."</p>

<p>"Let's all be quiet and think," said Phyllis; "no one's to speak
until it's thought of something."</p>

<p>So they were all quiet and so very still that a brown rat
thought that there was no one in the loft and came out very boldly.
When Bobbie sneezed, the rat was quite shocked and hurried away,
for he saw that a hay-loft where such things could happen was no
place for a respectable middle-aged rat that liked a quiet
life.</p>

<p>"Hooray!" cried Peter, suddenly, "I've got it." He jumped up and
kicked at the loose hay.</p>

<p>"What?" said the others, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Why, Perks is so nice to everybody. There must be lots of
people in the village who'd like to help to make him a birthday.
Let's go round and ask everybody."</p>

<p>"Mother said we weren't to ask people for things," said Bobbie,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"For ourselves, she meant, silly, not for other people. I'll ask
the old gentleman too. You see if I don't," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Let's ask Mother first," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Oh, what's the use of bothering Mother about every little
thing?" said Peter, "especially when she's busy. Come on. Let's go
down to the village now and begin."</p>

<p>So they went. The old lady at the Post-office said she didn't
see why Perks should have a birthday any more than anyone else.</p>

<p>"No," said Bobbie, "I should like everyone to have one. Only we
know when his is."</p>

<p>"Mine's to-morrow," said the old lady, "and much notice anyone
will take of it. Go along with you."</p>

<p>So they went.</p>

<p>And some people were kind, and some were crusty. And some would
give and some would not. It is rather difficult work asking for
things, even for other people, as you have no doubt found if you
have ever tried it.</p>

<p>When the children got home and counted up what had been given
and what had been promised, they felt that for the first day it was
not so bad. Peter wrote down the lists of the things in the little
pocket-book where he kept the numbers of his engines. These were
the lists:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>GIVEN.<br>
<br>
A tobacco pipe from the sweet shop.<br>
Half a pound of tea from the grocer's.<br>
A woollen scarf slightly faded from the draper's, which was the
other side of the grocer's.<br>
A stuffed squirrel from the Doctor.<br>
<br>
PROMISED.<br>
<br>
A piece of meat from the butcher.<br>
Six fresh eggs from the woman who lived in the old turnpike
cottage.<br>
A piece of honeycomb and six bootlaces from the cobbler, and an
iron shovel from the blacksmith's.</blockquote>

<p>Very early next morning Bobbie got up and woke Phyllis. This had
been agreed on between them. They had not told Peter because they
thought he would think it silly. But they told him afterwards, when
it had turned out all right.</p>

<p>They cut a big bunch of roses, and put it in a basket with the
needle-book that Phyllis had made for Bobbie on her birthday, and a
very pretty blue necktie of Phyllis's. Then they wrote on a paper:
'For Mrs. Ransome, with our best love, because it is her birthday,'
and they put the paper in the basket, and they took it to the
Post-office, and went in and put it on the counter and ran away
before the old woman at the Post-office had time to get into her
shop.</p>

<p>When they got home Peter had grown confidential over helping
Mother to get the breakfast and had told her their plans.</p>

<p>"There's no harm in it," said Mother, "but it depends <i>how</i>
you do it. I only hope he won't be offended and think it's
<i>charity</i>. Poor people are very proud, you know."</p>

<p>"It isn't because he's poor," said Phyllis; "it's because we're
fond of him."</p>

<p>"I'll find some things that Phyllis has outgrown," said Mother,
"if you're quite sure you can give them to him without his being
offended. I should like to do some little thing for him because
he's been so kind to you. I can't do much because we're poor
ourselves. What are you writing, Bobbie?"</p>

<p>"Nothing particular," said Bobbie, who had suddenly begun to
scribble. "I'm sure he'd like the things, Mother."</p>

<p>The morning of the fifteenth was spent very happily in getting
the buns and watching Mother make A. P. on them with pink sugar.
You know how it's done, of course? You beat up whites of eggs and
mix powdered sugar with them, and put in a few drops of cochineal.
And then you make a cone of clean, white paper with a little hole
at the pointed end, and put the pink egg-sugar in at the big end.
It runs slowly out at the pointed end, and you write the letters
with it just as though it were a great fat pen full of pink
sugar-ink.</p>

<p>The buns looked beautiful with A. P. on every one, and, when
they were put in a cool oven to set the sugar, the children went up
to the village to collect the honey and the shovel and the other
promised things.</p>

<p>The old lady at the Post-office was standing on her doorstep.
The children said "Good morning," politely, as they passed.</p>

<p>"Here, stop a bit," she said.</p>

<p>So they stopped.</p>

<p>"Those roses," said she.</p>

<p>"Did you like them?" said Phyllis; "they were as fresh as fresh.
<i>I</i> made the needle-book, but it was Bobbie's present." She
skipped joyously as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Here's your basket," said the Post-office woman. She went in
and brought out the basket. It was full of fat, red
gooseberries.</p>

<p>"I dare say Perks's children would like them," said she.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> an old dear," said Phyllis, throwing her arms
around the old lady's fat waist. "Perks <i>will</i> be
pleased."</p>

<p>"He won't be half so pleased as I was with your needle-book and
the tie and the pretty flowers and all," said the old lady, patting
Phyllis's shoulder. "You're good little souls, that you are. Look
here. I've got a pram round the back in the wood-lodge. It was got
for my Emmie's first, that didn't live but six months, and she
never had but that one. I'd like Mrs. Perks to have it. It 'ud be a
help to her with that great boy of hers. Will you take it
along?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oh</i>!" said all the children together.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Ransome had got out the perambulator and taken off the
careful papers that covered it, and dusted it all over, she
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, there it is. I don't know but what I'd have given it to
her before if I'd thought of it. Only I didn't quite know if she'd
accept of it from me. You tell her it was my Emmie's little one's
pram&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>isn't</i> it nice to think there is going to be a real
live baby in it again!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Ransome, sighing, and then laughing; "here,
I'll give you some peppermint cushions for the little ones, and
then you run along before I give you the roof off my head and the
clothes off my back."</p>

<p>All the things that had been collected for Perks were packed
into the perambulator, and at half-past three Peter and Bobbie and
Phyllis wheeled it down to the little yellow house where Perks
lived.</p>

<p>The house was very tidy. On the window ledge was a jug of
wild-flowers, big daisies, and red sorrel, and feathery, flowery
grasses.</p>

<p>There was a sound of splashing from the wash-house, and a partly
washed boy put his head round the door.</p>

<p>"Mother's a-changing of herself," he said.</p>

<p>"Down in a minute," a voice sounded down the narrow, freshly
scrubbed stairs.</p>

<p>The children waited. Next moment the stairs creaked and Mrs.
Perks came down, buttoning her bodice. Her hair was brushed very
smooth and tight, and her face shone with soap and water.</p>

<p>"I'm a bit late changing, Miss," she said to Bobbie, "owing to
me having had a extry clean-up to-day, along o' Perks happening to
name its being his birthday. I don't know what put it into his head
to think of such a thing. We keeps the children's birthdays, of
course; but him and me&mdash;we're too old for such like, as a
general rule."</p>

<p>"We knew it was his birthday," said Peter, "and we've got some
presents for him outside in the perambulator."</p>

<p>As the presents were being unpacked, Mrs. Perks gasped. When
they were all unpacked, she surprised and horrified the children by
sitting suddenly down on a wooden chair and bursting into
tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't!" said everybody; "oh, please don't!" And Peter
added, perhaps a little impatiently: "What on earth is the matter?
You don't mean to say you don't like it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Perks only sobbed. The Perks children, now as shiny-faced
as anyone could wish, stood at the wash-house door, and scowled at
the intruders. There was a silence, an awkward silence.</p>

<p>"<i>Don't</i> you like it?" said Peter, again, while his sisters
patted Mrs. Perks on the back.</p>

<p>She stopped crying as suddenly as she had begun.</p>

<p>"There, there, don't you mind me. I'M all right!" she said.
"Like it? Why, it's a birthday such as Perks never 'ad, not even
when 'e was a boy and stayed with his uncle, who was a corn
chandler in his own account. He failed afterwards. Like it?
Oh&mdash;" and then she went on and said all sorts of things that I
won't write down, because I am sure that Peter and Bobbie and
Phyllis would not like me to. Their ears got hotter and hotter, and
their faces redder and redder, at the kind things Mrs. Perks said.
They felt they had done nothing to deserve all this praise.</p>

<p>At last Peter said: "Look here, we're glad you're pleased. But
if you go on saying things like that, we must go home. And we did
want to stay and see if Mr. Perks is pleased, too. But we can't
stand this."</p>

<p>"I won't say another single word," said Mrs. Perks, with a
beaming face, "but that needn't stop me thinking, need it? For if
ever&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can we have a plate for the buns?" Bobbie asked abruptly. And
then Mrs. Perks hastily laid the table for tea, and the buns and
the honey and the gooseberries were displayed on plates, and the
roses were put in two glass jam jars, and the tea-table looked, as
Mrs. Perks said, "fit for a Prince."</p>

<p>"To think!" she said, "me getting the place tidy early, and the
little 'uns getting the wild-flowers and all&mdash;when never did I
think there'd be anything more for him except the ounce of his pet
particular that I got o' Saturday and been saving up for 'im ever
since. Bless us, 'e <i>is</i> early!"</p>

<p>Perks had indeed unlatched the latch of the little front
gate.</p>

<p>"Oh," whispered Bobbie, "let's hide in the back kitchen, and
<i>you</i> tell him about it. But give him the tobacco first,
because you got it for him. And when you've told him, we'll all
come in and shout, 'Many happy returns!'"</p>

<p>It was a very nice plan, but it did not quite come off. To begin
with, there was only just time for Peter and Bobbie and Phyllis to
rush into the wash-house, pushing the young and open-mouthed Perks
children in front of them. There was not time to shut the door, so
that, without at all meaning it, they had to listen to what went on
in the kitchen. The wash-house was a tight fit for the Perks
children and the Three Chimneys children, as well as all the
wash-house's proper furniture, including the mangle and the
copper.</p>

<p>"Hullo, old woman!" they heard Mr. Perks's voice say; "here's a
pretty set-out!"</p>

<p>"It's your birthday tea, Bert," said Mrs. Perks, "and here's a
ounce of your extry particular. I got it o' Saturday along o' your
happening to remember it was your birthday to-day."</p>

<p>"Good old girl!" said Mr. Perks, and there was a sound of a
kiss.</p>

<p>"But what's that pram doing here? And what's all these bundles?
And where did you get the sweetstuff, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The children did not hear what Mrs. Perks replied, because just
then Bobbie gave a start, put her hand in her pocket, and all her
body grew stiff with horror.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she whispered to the others, "whatever shall we do? I
forgot to put the labels on any of the things! He won't know what's
from who. He'll think it's all <i>us</i>, and that we're trying to
be grand or charitable or something horrid."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Peter.</p>

<p>And then they heard the voice of Mr. Perks, loud and rather
angry.</p>

<p>"I don't care," he said; "I won't stand it, and so I tell you
straight."</p>

<p>"But," said Mrs. Perks, "it's them children you make such a fuss
about&mdash;the children from the Three Chimneys."</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Perks, firmly, "not if it was a angel from
Heaven. We've got on all right all these years and no favours
asked. I'm not going to begin these sort of charity goings-on at my
time of life, so don't you think it, Nell."</p>

<p>"Oh, hush!" said poor Mrs Perks; "Bert, shut your silly tongue,
for goodness' sake. The all three of 'ems in the wash-house
a-listening to every word you speaks."</p>

<p>"Then I'll give them something to listen to," said the angry
Perks; "I've spoke my mind to them afore now, and I'll do it
again," he added, and he took two strides to the wash-house door,
and flung it wide open&mdash;as wide, that is, as it would go, with
the tightly packed children behind it.</p>

<p>"Come out," said Perks, "come out and tell me what you mean by
it. 'Ave I ever complained to you of being short, as you comes this
charity lay over me?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oh</i>!" said Phyllis, "I thought you'd be so pleased; I'll
never try to be kind to anyone else as long as I live. No, I won't,
not never."</p>

<p>She burst into tears.</p>

<p>"We didn't mean any harm," said Peter.</p>

<p>"It ain't what you means so much as what you does," said
Perks.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>don't</i>!" cried Bobbie, trying hard to be braver than
Phyllis, and to find more words than Peter had done for explaining
in. "We thought you'd love it. We always have things on our
birthdays."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Perks, "your own relations; that's
different."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Bobbie answered. "<i>Not</i> our own relations. All
the servants always gave us things at home, and us to them when it
was their birthdays. And when it was mine, and Mother gave me the
brooch like a buttercup, Mrs. Viney gave me two lovely glass pots,
and nobody thought she was coming the charity lay over us."</p>

<p>"If it had been glass pots here," said Perks, "I wouldn't ha'
said so much. It's there being all this heaps and heaps of things I
can't stand. No&mdash;nor won't, neither."</p>

<p>"But they're not all from us&mdash;" said Peter, "only we forgot
to put the labels on. They're from all sorts of people in the
village."</p>

<p>"Who put 'em up to it, I'd like to know?" asked Perks.</p>

<p>"Why, we did," sniffed Phyllis.</p>

<p>Perks sat down heavily in the elbow-chair and looked at them
with what Bobbie afterwards described as withering glances of
gloomy despair.</p>

<p>"So you've been round telling the neighbours we can't make both
ends meet? Well, now you've disgraced us as deep as you can in the
neighbourhood, you can just take the whole bag of tricks back w'ere
it come from. Very much obliged, I'm sure. I don't doubt but what
you meant it kind, but I'd rather not be acquainted with you any
longer if it's all the same to you." He deliberately turned the
chair round so that his back was turned to the children. The legs
of the chair grated on the brick floor, and that was the only sound
that broke the silence.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Bobbie spoke.</p>

<p>"Look here," she said, "this is most awful."</p>

<p>"That's what I says," said Perks, not turning round.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Bobbie, desperately, "we'll go if you
like&mdash;and you needn't be friends with us any more if you don't
want, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> shall always be friends with <i>you</i>, however
nasty you are to us," sniffed Phyllis, wildly.</p>

<p>"Be quiet," said Peter, in a fierce aside.</p>

<p>"But before we go," Bobbie went on desperately, "do let us show
you the labels we wrote to put on the things."</p>

<p>"I don't want to see no labels," said Perks, "except proper
luggage ones in my own walk of life. Do you think I've kept
respectable and outer debt on what I gets, and her having to take
in washing, to be give away for a laughing-stock to all the
neighbours?"</p>

<p>"Laughing?" said Peter; "you don't know."</p>

<p>"You're a very hasty gentleman," whined Phyllis; "you know you
were wrong once before, about us not telling you the secret about
the Russian. Do let Bobbie tell you about the labels!"</p>

<p>"Well. Go ahead!" said Perks, grudgingly.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Bobbie, fumbling miserably, yet not without
hope, in her tightly stuffed pocket, "we wrote down all the things
everybody said when they gave us the things, with the people's
names, because Mother said we ought to be
careful&mdash;because&mdash;but I wrote down what she
said&mdash;and you'll see."</p>

<p>But Bobbie could not read the labels just at once. She had to
swallow once or twice before she could begin.</p>

<p>Mrs. Perks had been crying steadily ever since her husband had
opened the wash-house door. Now she caught her breath, choked, and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't you upset yourself, Missy. <i>I</i> know you meant it
kind if he doesn't."</p>

<p>"May I read the labels?" said Bobbie, crying on to the slips as
she tried to sort them. "Mother's first. It says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Little Clothes for Mrs. Perks's children.' Mother said, 'I'll
find some of Phyllis's things that she's grown out of if you're
quite sure Mr. Perks wouldn't be offended and think it's meant for
charity. I'd like to do some little thing for him, because he's so
kind to you. I can't do much because we're poor ourselves.'"</p>

<p>Bobbie paused.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Perks, "your Ma's a born lady. We'll
keep the little frocks, and what not, Nell."</p>

<p>"Then there's the perambulator and the gooseberries, and the
sweets," said Bobbie, "they're from Mrs. Ransome. She said: 'I dare
say Mr. Perks's children would like the sweets. And the
perambulator was got for my Emmie's first&mdash;it didn't live but
six months, and she's never had but that one. I'd like Mrs. Perks
to have it. It would be a help with her fine boy. I'd have given it
before if I'd been sure she'd accept of it from me.' She told me to
tell you," Bobbie added, "that it was her Emmie's little one's
pram."</p>

<p>"I can't send that pram back, Bert," said Mrs Perks, firmly,
"and I won't. So don't you ask me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not a-asking anything," said Perks, gruffly.</p>

<p>"Then the shovel," said Bobbie. "Mr. James made it for you
himself. And he said&mdash;where is it? Oh, yes, here! He said,
'You tell Mr. Perks it's a pleasure to make a little trifle for a
man as is so much respected,' and then he said he wished he could
shoe your children and his own children, like they do the horses,
because, well, he knew what shoe leather was."</p>

<p>"James is a good enough chap," said Perks.</p>

<p>"Then the honey," said Bobbie, in haste, "and the boot-laces.
<i>He</i> said he respected a man that paid his way&mdash;and the
butcher said the same. And the old turnpike woman said many was the
time you'd lent her a hand with her garden when you were a
lad&mdash;and things like that came home to roost&mdash;I don't
know what she meant. And everybody who gave anything said they
liked you, and it was a very good idea of ours; and nobody said
anything about charity or anything horrid like that. And the old
gentleman gave Peter a gold pound for you, and said you were a man
who knew your work. And I thought you'd <i>love</i> to know how
fond people are of you, and I never was so unhappy in my life.
Good-bye. I hope you'll forgive us some day&mdash;"</p>

<p>She could say no more, and she turned to go.</p>

<p>"Stop," said Perks, still with his back to them; "I take back
every word I've said contrary to what you'd wish. Nell, set on the
kettle."</p>

<p>"We'll take the things away if you're unhappy about them," said
Peter; "but I think everybody'll be most awfully disappointed, as
well as us."</p>

<p>"I'm not unhappy about them," said Perks; "I don't know," he
added, suddenly wheeling the chair round and showing a very
odd-looking screwed-up face, "I don't know as ever I was better
pleased. Not so much with the presents&mdash;though they're an A1
collection&mdash;but the kind respect of our neighbours. That's
worth having, eh, Nell?"</p>

<p>"I think it's all worth having," said Mrs. Perks, "and you've
made a most ridiculous fuss about nothing, Bert, if you ask
me."</p>

<p>"No, I ain't," said Perks, firmly; "if a man didn't respect
hisself, no one wouldn't do it for him."</p>

<p>"But everyone respects you," said Bobbie; "they all said
so."</p>

<p>"I knew you'd like it when you really understood," said Phyllis,
brightly.</p>

<p>"Humph! You'll stay to tea?" said Mr. Perks.</p>

<p>Later on Peter proposed Mr. Perks's health. And Mr. Perks
proposed a toast, also honoured in tea, and the toast was, "May the
garland of friendship be ever green," which was much more poetical
than anyone had expected from him.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>"Jolly good little kids, those," said Mr. Perks to his wife as
they went to bed.</p>

<p>"Oh, they're all right, bless their hearts," said his wife;
"it's you that's the aggravatingest old thing that ever was. I was
ashamed of you&mdash;I tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You didn't need to be, old gal. I climbed down handsome soon as
I understood it wasn't charity. But charity's what I never did
abide, and won't neither."</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>All sorts of people were made happy by that birthday party. Mr.
Perks and Mrs. Perks and the little Perkses by all the nice things
and by the kind thoughts of their neighbours; the Three Chimneys
children by the success, undoubted though unexpectedly delayed, of
their plan; and Mrs. Ransome every time she saw the fat Perks baby
in the perambulator. Mrs. Perks made quite a round of visits to
thank people for their kind birthday presents, and after each visit
felt that she had a better friend than she had thought.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Perks, reflectively, "it's not so much what you does
as what you means; that's what I say. Now if it had been
charity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, drat charity," said Mrs. Perks; "nobody won't offer you
charity, Bert, however much you was to want it, I lay. That was
just friendliness, that was."</p>

<p>When the clergyman called on Mrs. Perks, she told him all about
it. "It <i>was</i> friendliness, wasn't it, Sir?" said she.</p>

<p>"I think," said the clergyman, "it was what is sometimes called
loving-kindness."</p>

<p>So you see it was all right in the end. But if one does that
sort of thing, one has to be careful to do it in the right way.
For, as Mr. Perks said, when he had time to think it over, it's not
so much what you do, as what you mean.</p>

<h2>Chapter X. The terrible secret.</h2>

<p>When they first went to live at Three Chimneys, the children had
talked a great deal about their Father, and had asked a great many
questions about him, and what he was doing and where he was and
when he would come home. Mother always answered their questions as
well as she could. But as the time went on they grew to speak less
of him. Bobbie had felt almost from the first that for some strange
miserable reason these questions hurt Mother and made her sad. And
little by little the others came to have this feeling, too, though
they could not have put it into words.</p>

<p>One day, when Mother was working so hard that she could not
leave off even for ten minutes, Bobbie carried up her tea to the
big bare room that they called Mother's workshop. It had hardly any
furniture. Just a table and a chair and a rug. But always big pots
of flowers on the window-sills and on the mantelpiece. The children
saw to that. And from the three long uncurtained windows the
beautiful stretch of meadow and moorland, the far violet of the
hills, and the unchanging changefulness of cloud and sky.</p>

<p>"Here's your tea, Mother-love," said Bobbie; "do drink it while
it's hot."</p>

<p>Mother laid down her pen among the pages that were scattered all
over the table, pages covered with her writing, which was almost as
plain as print, and much prettier. She ran her hands into her hair,
as if she were going to pull it out by handfuls.</p>

<p>"Poor dear head," said Bobbie, "does it ache?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;yes&mdash;not much," said Mother. "Bobbie, do you
think Peter and Phil are <i>forgetting</i> Father?"</p>

<p>"<i>No</i>," said Bobbie, indignantly. "Why?"</p>

<p>"You none of you ever speak of him now."</p>

<p>Bobbie stood first on one leg and then on the other.</p>

<p>"We often talk about him when we're by ourselves," she said.</p>

<p>"But not to me," said Mother. "Why?"</p>

<p>Bobbie did not find it easy to say why.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;you&mdash;" she said and stopped. She went over to the
window and looked out.</p>

<p>"Bobbie, come here," said her Mother, and Bobbie came.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mother, putting her arm round Bobbie and laying her
ruffled head against Bobbie's shoulder, "try to tell me, dear."</p>

<p>Bobbie fidgeted.</p>

<p>"Tell Mother."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Bobbie, "I thought you were so unhappy about
Daddy not being here, it made you worse when I talked about him. So
I stopped doing it."</p>

<p>"And the others?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about the others," said Bobbie. "I never said
anything about <i>that</i> to them. But I expect they felt the same
about it as me."</p>

<p>"Bobbie dear," said Mother, still leaning her head against her,
"I'll tell you. Besides parting from Father, he and I have had a
great sorrow&mdash;oh, terrible&mdash;worse than anything you can
think of, and at first it did hurt to hear you all talking of him
as if everything were just the same. But it would be much more
terrible if you were to forget him. That would be worse than
anything."</p>

<p>"The trouble," said Bobbie, in a very little voice&mdash;"I
promised I would never ask you any questions, and I never have,
have I? But&mdash; the trouble&mdash;it won't last always?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mother, "the worst will be over when Father comes
home to us."</p>

<p>"I wish I could comfort you," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, do you suppose you don't? Do you think I haven't
noticed how good you've all been, not quarrelling nearly as much as
you used to&mdash;and all the little kind things you do for
me&mdash;the flowers, and cleaning my shoes, and tearing up to make
my bed before I get time to do it myself?"</p>

<p>Bobbie <i>had</i> sometimes wondered whether Mother noticed
these things.</p>

<p>"That's nothing," she said, "to what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I <i>must</i> get on with my work," said Mother, giving Bobbie
one last squeeze. "Don't say anything to the others."</p>

<p>That evening in the hour before bed-time instead of reading to
the children Mother told them stories of the games she and Father
used to have when they were children and lived near each other in
the country&mdash;tales of the adventures of Father with Mother's
brothers when they were all boys together. Very funny stories they
were, and the children laughed as they listened.</p>

<p>"Uncle Edward died before he was grown up, didn't he?" said
Phyllis, as Mother lighted the bedroom candles.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said Mother, "you would have loved him. He was such
a brave boy, and so adventurous. Always in mischief, and yet
friends with everybody in spite of it. And your Uncle Reggie's in
Ceylon&mdash; yes, and Father's away, too. But I think they'd all
like to think we'd enjoyed talking about the things they used to
do. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Not Uncle Edward," said Phyllis, in a shocked tone; "he's in
Heaven."</p>

<p>"You don't suppose he's forgotten us and all the old times,
because God has taken him, any more than I forget him. Oh, no, he
remembers. He's only away for a little time. We shall see him some
day."</p>

<p>"And Uncle Reggie&mdash;and Father, too?" said Peter.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mother. "Uncle Reggie and Father, too. Good night,
my darlings."</p>

<p>"Good night," said everyone. Bobbie hugged her mother more
closely even than usual, and whispered in her ear, "Oh, I do love
you so, Mummy&mdash;I do&mdash;I do&mdash;"</p>

<p>When Bobbie came to think it all over, she tried not to wonder
what the great trouble was. But she could not always help it.
Father was not dead&mdash;like poor Uncle Edward&mdash;Mother had
said so. And he was not ill, or Mother would have been with him.
Being poor wasn't the trouble. Bobbie knew it was something nearer
the heart than money could be.</p>

<p>"I mustn't try to think what it is," she told herself; "no, I
mustn't. I <i>am</i> glad Mother noticed about us not quarrelling
so much. We'll keep that up."</p>

<p>And alas, that very afternoon she and Peter had what Peter
called a first-class shindy.</p>

<p>They had not been a week at Three Chimneys before they had asked
Mother to let them have a piece of garden each for their very own,
and she had agreed, and the south border under the peach trees had
been divided into three pieces and they were allowed to plant
whatever they liked there.</p>

<p>Phyllis had planted mignonette and nasturtium and Virginia Stock
in hers. The seeds came up, and though they looked just like weeds,
Phyllis believed that they would bear flowers some day. The
Virginia Stock justified her faith quite soon, and her garden was
gay with a band of bright little flowers, pink and white and red
and mauve.</p>

<p>"I can't weed for fear I pull up the wrong things," she used to
say comfortably; "it saves such a lot of work."</p>

<p>Peter sowed vegetable seeds in his&mdash;carrots and onions and
turnips. The seed was given to him by the farmer who lived in the
nice black-and-white, wood-and-plaster house just beyond the
bridge. He kept turkeys and guinea fowls, and was a most amiable
man. But Peter's vegetables never had much of a chance, because he
liked to use the earth of his garden for digging canals, and making
forts and earthworks for his toy soldiers. And the seeds of
vegetables rarely come to much in a soil that is constantly
disturbed for the purposes of war and irrigation.</p>

<p>Bobbie planted rose-bushes in her garden, but all the little new
leaves of the rose-bushes shrivelled and withered, perhaps because
she moved them from the other part of the garden in May, which is
not at all the right time of year for moving roses. But she would
not own that they were dead, and hoped on against hope, until the
day when Perks came up to see the garden, and told her quite
plainly that all her roses were as dead as doornails.</p>

<p>"Only good for bonfires, Miss," he said. "You just dig 'em up
and burn 'em, and I'll give you some nice fresh roots outer my
garden; pansies, and stocks, and sweet willies, and forget-me-nots.
I'll bring 'em along to-morrow if you get the ground ready."</p>

<p>So next day she set to work, and that happened to be the day
when Mother had praised her and the others about not quarrelling.
She moved the rose-bushes and carried them to the other end of the
garden, where the rubbish heap was that they meant to make a
bonfire of when Guy Fawkes' Day came.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Peter had decided to flatten out all his forts and
earthworks, with a view to making a model of the railway-tunnel,
cutting, embankment, canal, aqueduct, bridges, and all.</p>

<p>So when Bobbie came back from her last thorny journey with the
dead rose-bushes, he had got the rake and was using it busily.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> was using the rake," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm using it now," said Peter.</p>

<p>"But I had it first," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Then it's my turn now," said Peter. And that was how the
quarrel began.</p>

<p>"You're always being disagreeable about nothing," said Peter,
after some heated argument.</p>

<p>"I had the rake first," said Bobbie, flushed and defiant,
holding on to its handle.</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;I tell you I said this morning I meant to have it.
Didn't I, Phil?"</p>

<p>Phyllis said she didn't want to be mixed up in their rows. And
instantly, of course, she was.</p>

<p>"If you remember, you ought to say."</p>

<p>"Of course she doesn't remember&mdash;but she might say so."</p>

<p>"I wish I'd had a brother instead of two whiny little kiddy
sisters," said Peter. This was always recognised as indicating the
high-water mark of Peter's rage.</p>

<p>Bobbie made the reply she always made to it.</p>

<p>"I can't think why little boys were ever invented," and just as
she said it she looked up, and saw the three long windows of
Mother's workshop flashing in the red rays of the sun. The sight
brought back those words of praise:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You don't quarrel like you used to do."</p>

<p>"<i>Oh</i>!" cried Bobbie, just as if she had been hit, or had
caught her finger in a door, or had felt the hideous sharp
beginnings of toothache.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" said Phyllis.</p>

<p>Bobbie wanted to say: "Don't let's quarrel. Mother hates it so,"
but though she tried hard, she couldn't. Peter was looking too
disagreeable and insulting.</p>

<p>"Take the horrid rake, then," was the best she could manage. And
she suddenly let go her hold on the handle. Peter had been holding
on to it too firmly and pullingly, and now that the pull the other
way was suddenly stopped, he staggered and fell over backward, the
teeth of the rake between his feet.</p>

<p>"Serve you right," said Bobbie, before she could stop
herself.</p>

<p>Peter lay still for half a moment&mdash;long enough to frighten
Bobbie a little. Then he frightened her a little more, for he sat
up&mdash; screamed once&mdash;turned rather pale, and then lay back
and began to shriek, faintly but steadily. It sounded exactly like
a pig being killed a quarter of a mile off.</p>

<p>Mother put her head out of the window, and it wasn't half a
minute after that she was in the garden kneeling by the side of
Peter, who never for an instant ceased to squeal.</p>

<p>"What happened, Bobbie?" Mother asked.</p>

<p>"It was the rake," said Phyllis. "Peter was pulling at it, so
was Bobbie, and she let go and he went over."</p>

<p>"Stop that noise, Peter," said Mother. "Come. Stop at once."</p>

<p>Peter used up what breath he had left in a last squeal and
stopped.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mother, "are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"If he was really hurt, he wouldn't make such a fuss," said
Bobbie, still trembling with fury; "he's not a coward!"</p>

<p>"I think my foot's broken off, that's all," said Peter, huffily,
and sat up. Then he turned quite white. Mother put her arm round
him.</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> hurt," she said; "he's fainted. Here, Bobbie, sit
down and take his head on your lap."</p>

<p>Then Mother undid Peter's boots. As she took the right one off,
something dripped from his foot on to the ground. It was red blood.
And when the stocking came off there were three red wounds in
Peter's foot and ankle, where the teeth of the rake had bitten him,
and his foot was covered with red smears.</p>

<p>"Run for water&mdash;a basinful," said Mother, and Phyllis ran.
She upset most of the water out of the basin in her haste, and had
to fetch more in a jug.</p>

<p>Peter did not open his eyes again till Mother had tied her
handkerchief round his foot, and she and Bobbie had carried him in
and laid him on the brown wooden settle in the dining-room. By this
time Phyllis was halfway to the Doctor's.</p>

<p>Mother sat by Peter and bathed his foot and talked to him, and
Bobbie went out and got tea ready, and put on the kettle.</p>

<p>"It's all I can do," she told herself. "Oh, suppose Peter should
die, or be a helpless cripple for life, or have to walk with
crutches, or wear a boot with a sole like a log of wood!"</p>

<p>She stood by the back door reflecting on these gloomy
possibilities, her eyes fixed on the water-butt.</p>

<p>"I wish I'd never been born," she said, and she said it out
loud.</p>

<p>"Why, lawk a mercy, what's that for?" asked a voice, and Perks
stood before her with a wooden trug basket full of green-leaved
things and soft, loose earth.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you," she said. "Peter's hurt his foot with a
rake&mdash;three great gaping wounds, like soldiers get. And it was
partly my fault."</p>

<p>"That it wasn't, I'll go bail," said Perks. "Doctor seen
him?"</p>

<p>"Phyllis has gone for the Doctor."</p>

<p>"He'll be all right; you see if he isn't," said Perks. "Why, my
father's second cousin had a hay-fork run into him, right into his
inside, and he was right as ever in a few weeks, all except his
being a bit weak in the head afterwards, and they did say that it
was along of his getting a touch of the sun in the hay-field, and
not the fork at all. I remember him well. A kind-'earted chap, but
soft, as you might say."</p>

<p>Bobbie tried to let herself be cheered by this heartening
reminiscence.</p>

<p>"Well," said Perks, "you won't want to be bothered with
gardening just this minute, I dare say. You show me where your
garden is, and I'll pop the bits of stuff in for you. And I'll hang
about, if I may make so free, to see the Doctor as he comes out and
hear what he says. You cheer up, Missie. I lay a pound he ain't
hurt, not to speak of."</p>

<p>But he was. The Doctor came and looked at the foot and bandaged
it beautifully, and said that Peter must not put it to the ground
for at least a week.</p>

<p>"He won't be lame, or have to wear crutches or a lump on his
foot, will he?" whispered Bobbie, breathlessly, at the door.</p>

<p>"My aunt! No!" said Dr. Forrest; "he'll be as nimble as ever on
his pins in a fortnight. Don't you worry, little Mother Goose."</p>

<p>It was when Mother had gone to the gate with the Doctor to take
his last instructions and Phyllis was filling the kettle for tea,
that Peter and Bobbie found themselves alone.</p>

<p>"He says you won't be lame or anything," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Oh, course I shan't, silly," said Peter, very much relieved all
the same.</p>

<p>"Oh, Peter, I <i>am</i> so sorry," said Bobbie, after a
pause.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Peter, gruffly.</p>

<p>"It was <i>all</i> my fault," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Rot," said Peter.</p>

<p>"If we hadn't quarrelled, it wouldn't have happened. I knew it
was wrong to quarrel. I wanted to say so, but somehow I
couldn't."</p>

<p>"Don't drivel," said Peter. "I shouldn't have stopped if you
<i>had</i> said it. Not likely. And besides, us rowing hadn't
anything to do with it. I might have caught my foot in the hoe, or
taken off my fingers in the chaff-cutting machine or blown my nose
off with fireworks. It would have been hurt just the same whether
we'd been rowing or not."</p>

<p>"But I knew it was wrong to quarrel," said Bobbie, in tears,
"and now you're hurt and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now look here," said Peter, firmly, "you just dry up. If you're
not careful, you'll turn into a beastly little Sunday-school prig,
so I tell you."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to be a prig. But it's so hard not to be when
you're really trying to be good."</p>

<p>(The Gentle Reader may perhaps have suffered from this
difficulty.)</p>

<p>"Not it," said Peter; "it's a jolly good thing it wasn't you was
hurt. I'm glad it was <i>me</i>. There! If it had been you, you'd
have been lying on the sofa looking like a suffering angel and
being the light of the anxious household and all that. And I
couldn't have stood it."</p>

<p>"No, I shouldn't," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Yes, you would," said Peter.</p>

<p>"I tell you I shouldn't."</p>

<p>"I tell you you would."</p>

<p>"Oh, children," said Mother's voice at the door. "Quarrelling
again? Already?"</p>

<p>"We aren't quarrelling&mdash;not really," said Peter. "I wish
you wouldn't think it's rows every time we don't agree!" When
Mother had gone out again, Bobbie broke out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Peter, I <i>am</i> sorry you're hurt. But you <i>are</i> a
beast to say I'm a prig."</p>

<p>"Well," said Peter unexpectedly, "perhaps I am. You did say I
wasn't a coward, even when you were in such a wax. The only thing
is&mdash;don't you be a prig, that's all. You keep your eyes open
and if you feel priggishness coming on just stop in time. See?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bobbie, "I see."</p>

<p>"Then let's call it Pax," said Peter, magnanimously: "bury the
hatchet in the fathoms of the past. Shake hands on it. I say,
Bobbie, old chap, I am tired."</p>

<p>He was tired for many days after that, and the settle seemed
hard and uncomfortable in spite of all the pillows and bolsters and
soft folded rugs. It was terrible not to be able to go out. They
moved the settle to the window, and from there Peter could see the
smoke of the trains winding along the valley. But he could not see
the trains.</p>

<p>At first Bobbie found it quite hard to be as nice to him as she
wanted to be, for fear he should think her priggish. But that soon
wore off, and both she and Phyllis were, as he observed, jolly good
sorts. Mother sat with him when his sisters were out. And the
words, "he's not a coward," made Peter determined not to make any
fuss about the pain in his foot, though it was rather bad,
especially at night.</p>

<p>Praise helps people very much, sometimes.</p>

<p>There were visitors, too. Mrs. Perks came up to ask how he was,
and so did the Station Master, and several of the village people.
But the time went slowly, slowly.</p>

<p>"I do wish there was something to read," said Peter. "I've read
all our books fifty times over."</p>

<p>"I'll go to the Doctor's," said Phyllis; "he's sure to have
some."</p>

<p>"Only about how to be ill, and about people's nasty insides, I
expect," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Perks has a whole heap of Magazines that came out of trains
when people are tired of them," said Bobbie. "I'll run down and ask
him."</p>

<p>So the girls went their two ways.</p>

<p>Bobbie found Perks busy cleaning lamps.</p>

<p>"And how's the young gent?" said he.</p>

<p>"Better, thanks," said Bobbie, "but he's most frightfully bored.
I came to ask if you'd got any Magazines you could lend him."</p>

<p>"There, now," said Perks, regretfully, rubbing his ear with a
black and oily lump of cotton waste, "why didn't I think of that,
now? I was trying to think of something as 'ud amuse him only this
morning, and I couldn't think of anything better than a guinea-pig.
And a young chap I know's going to fetch that over for him this
tea-time."</p>

<p>"How lovely! A real live guinea! He will be pleased. But he'd
like the Magazines as well."</p>

<p>"That's just it," said Perks. "I've just sent the pick of 'em to
Snigson's boy&mdash;him what's just getting over the pewmonia. But
I've lots of illustrated papers left."</p>

<p>He turned to the pile of papers in the corner and took up a heap
six inches thick.</p>

<p>"There!" he said. "I'll just slip a bit of string and a bit of
paper round 'em."</p>

<p>He pulled an old newspaper from the pile and spread it on the
table, and made a neat parcel of it.</p>

<p>"There," said he, "there's lots of pictures, and if he likes to
mess 'em about with his paint-box, or coloured chalks or what not,
why, let him. <i>I</i> don't want 'em."</p>

<p>"You're a dear," said Bobbie, took the parcel, and started. The
papers were heavy, and when she had to wait at the level-crossing
while a train went by, she rested the parcel on the top of the
gate. And idly she looked at the printing on the paper that the
parcel was wrapped in.</p>

<p>Suddenly she clutched the parcel tighter and bent her head over
it. It seemed like some horrible dream. She read on&mdash;the
bottom of the column was torn off&mdash;she could read no
farther.</p>

<p>She never remembered how she got home. But she went on tiptoe to
her room and locked the door. Then she undid the parcel and read
that printed column again, sitting on the edge of her bed, her
hands and feet icy cold and her face burning. When she had read all
there was, she drew a long, uneven breath.</p>

<p>"So now I know," she said.</p>

<p>What she had read was headed, 'End of the Trial. Verdict.
Sentence.'</p>

<p>The name of the man who had been tried was the name of her
Father. The verdict was 'Guilty.' And the sentence was 'Five years'
Penal Servitude.'</p>

<p>"Oh, Daddy," she whispered, crushing the paper hard, "it's not
true&mdash;I don't believe it. You never did it! Never, never,
never!"</p>

<p>There was a hammering on the door.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"It's me," said the voice of Phyllis; "tea's ready, and a boy's
brought Peter a guinea-pig. Come along down."</p>

<p>And Bobbie had to.</p>

<h2>Chapter XI. The hound in the red jersey.</h2>

<p>Bobbie knew the secret now. A sheet of old newspaper wrapped
round a parcel&mdash;just a little chance like that&mdash;had given
the secret to her. And she had to go down to tea and pretend that
there was nothing the matter. The pretence was bravely made, but it
wasn't very successful.</p>

<p>For when she came in, everyone looked up from tea and saw her
pink-lidded eyes and her pale face with red tear-blotches on
it.</p>

<p>"My darling," cried Mother, jumping up from the tea-tray,
"whatever <i>is</i> the matter?"</p>

<p>"My head aches, rather," said Bobbie. And indeed it did.</p>

<p>"Has anything gone wrong?" Mother asked.</p>

<p>"I'm all right, really," said Bobbie, and she telegraphed to her
Mother from her swollen eyes this brief, imploring
message&mdash;"<i>not</i> before the others!"</p>

<p>Tea was not a cheerful meal. Peter was so distressed by the
obvious fact that something horrid had happened to Bobbie that he
limited his speech to repeating, "More bread and butter, please,"
at startlingly short intervals. Phyllis stroked her sister's hand
under the table to express sympathy, and knocked her cup over as
she did it. Fetching a cloth and wiping up the spilt milk helped
Bobbie a little. But she thought that tea would never end. Yet at
last it did end, as all things do at last, and when Mother took out
the tray, Bobbie followed her.</p>

<p>"She's gone to own up," said Phyllis to Peter; "I wonder what
she's done."</p>

<p>"Broken something, I suppose," said Peter, "but she needn't be
so silly over it. Mother never rows for accidents. Listen! Yes,
they're going upstairs. She's taking Mother up to show
her&mdash;the water-jug with storks on it, I expect it is."</p>

<p>Bobbie, in the kitchen, had caught hold of Mother's hand as she
set down the tea-things.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Mother asked.</p>

<p>But Bobbie only said, "Come upstairs, come up where nobody can
hear us."</p>

<p>When she had got Mother alone in her room she locked the door
and then stood quite still, and quite without words.</p>

<p>All through tea she had been thinking of what to say; she had
decided that "I know all," or "All is known to me," or "The
terrible secret is a secret no longer," would be the proper thing.
But now that she and her Mother and that awful sheet of newspaper
were alone in the room together, she found that she could say
nothing.</p>

<p>Suddenly she went to Mother and put her arms round her and began
to cry again. And still she could find no words, only, "Oh, Mammy,
oh, Mammy, oh, Mammy," over and over again.</p>

<p>Mother held her very close and waited.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bobbie broke away from her and went to her bed. From
under her mattress she pulled out the paper she had hidden there,
and held it out, pointing to her Father's name with a finger that
shook.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bobbie," Mother cried, when one little quick look had shown
her what it was, "you don't <i>believe</i> it? You don't believe
Daddy did it?"</p>

<p>"<i>No</i>," Bobbie almost shouted. She had stopped crying.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Mother. "It's not true. And they've
shut him up in prison, but he's done nothing wrong. He's good and
noble and honourable, and he belongs to us. We have to think of
that, and be proud of him, and wait."</p>

<p>Again Bobbie clung to her Mother, and again only one word came
to her, but now that word was "Daddy," and "Oh, Daddy, oh, Daddy,
oh, Daddy!" again and again.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me, Mammy?" she asked presently.</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell the others?" Mother asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Mother; "so you understand why I didn't tell
you. We two must help each other to be brave."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bobbie; "Mother, will it make you more unhappy if
you tell me all about it? I want to understand."</p>

<p>So then, sitting cuddled up close to her Mother, Bobbie heard
"all about it." She heard how those men, who had asked to see
Father on that remembered last night when the Engine was being
mended, had come to arrest him, charging him with selling State
secrets to the Russians&mdash;with being, in fact, a spy and a
traitor. She heard about the trial, and about the
evidence&mdash;letters, found in Father's desk at the office,
letters that convinced the jury that Father was guilty.</p>

<p>"Oh, how could they look at him and believe it!" cried Bobbie;
"and how could <i>any</i> one do such a thing!"</p>

<p>"<i>Someone</i> did it," said Mother, "and all the evidence was
against Father. Those letters&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. How did the letters get into his desk?"</p>

<p>"Someone put them there. And the person who put them there was
the person who was really guilty."</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> must be feeling pretty awful all this time," said
Bobbie, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he had any feelings," Mother said hotly; "he
couldn't have done a thing like that if he had."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he just shoved the letters into the desk to hide them
when he thought he was going to be found out. Why don't you tell
the lawyers, or someone, that it must have been that person? There
wasn't anyone that would have hurt Father on purpose, was
there?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I don't know. The man under him who got
Daddy's place when he&mdash;when the awful thing happened&mdash;he
was always jealous of your Father because Daddy was so clever and
everyone thought such a lot of him. And Daddy never quite trusted
that man."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we explain all that to someone?"</p>

<p>"Nobody will listen," said Mother, very bitterly, "nobody at
all. Do you suppose I've not tried everything? No, my dearest,
there's nothing to be done. All we can do, you and I and Daddy, is
to be brave, and patient, and&mdash;" she spoke very
softly&mdash;"to pray, Bobbie, dear."</p>

<p>"Mother, you've got very thin," said Bobbie, abruptly.</p>

<p>"A little, perhaps."</p>

<p>"And oh," said Bobbie, "I do think you're the bravest person in
the world as well as the nicest!"</p>

<p>"We won't talk of all this any more, will we, dear?" said
Mother; "we must bear it and be brave. And, darling, try not to
think of it. Try to be cheerful, and to amuse yourself and the
others. It's much easier for me if you can be a little bit happy
and enjoy things. Wash your poor little round face, and let's go
out into the garden for a bit."</p>

<p>The other two were very gentle and kind to Bobbie. And they did
not ask her what was the matter. This was Peter's idea, and he had
drilled Phyllis, who would have asked a hundred questions if she
had been left to herself.</p>

<p>A week later Bobbie managed to get away alone. And once more she
wrote a letter. And once more it was to the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"My dear Friend," she said, "you see what is in this paper. It
is not true. Father never did it. Mother says someone put the
papers in Father's desk, and she says the man under him that got
Father's place afterwards was jealous of Father, and Father
suspected him a long time. But nobody listens to a word she says,
but you are so good and clever, and you found out about the Russian
gentleman's wife directly. Can't you find out who did the treason
because he wasn't Father upon my honour; he is an Englishman and
uncapable to do such things, and then they would let Father out of
prison. It is dreadful, and Mother is getting so thin. She told us
once to pray for all prisoners and captives. I see now. Oh, do help
me&mdash;there is only just Mother and me know, and we can't do
anything. Peter and Phil don't know. I'll pray for you twice every
day as long as I live if you'll only try&mdash;just try to find
out. Think if it was <i>your</i> Daddy, what you would feel. Oh,
do, do, <i>do</i> help me. With love,</p>

<p>"I remain Your affectionately little friend</p>

<p>"Roberta.</p>

<p>"P.S. Mother would send her kind regards if she knew I am
writing&mdash; but it is no use telling her I am, in case you can't
do anything. But I know you will. Bobbie with best love."</p>

<p>She cut the account of her Father's trial out of the newspaper
with Mother's big cutting-out scissors, and put it in the envelope
with her letter.</p>

<p>Then she took it down to the station, going out the back way and
round by the road, so that the others should not see her and offer
to come with her, and she gave the letter to the Station Master to
give to the old gentleman next morning.</p>

<p>"Where <i>have</i> you been?" shouted Peter, from the top of the
yard wall where he and Phyllis were.</p>

<p>"To the station, of course," said Bobbie; "give us a hand,
Pete."</p>

<p>She set her foot on the lock of the yard door. Peter reached
down a hand.</p>

<p>"What on earth?" she asked as she reached the wall-top&mdash;for
Phyllis and Peter were very muddy. A lump of wet clay lay between
them on the wall, they had each a slip of slate in a very dirty
hand, and behind Peter, out of the reach of accidents, were several
strange rounded objects rather like very fat sausages, hollow, but
closed up at one end.</p>

<p>"It's nests," said Peter, "swallows' nests. We're going to dry
them in the oven and hang them up with string under the eaves of
the coach-house."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Phyllis; "and then we're going to save up all the
wool and hair we can get, and in the spring we'll line them, and
then how pleased the swallows will be!"</p>

<p>"I've often thought people don't do nearly enough for dumb
animals," said Peter with an air of virtue. "I do think people
might have thought of making nests for poor little swallows before
this."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Bobbie, vaguely, "if everybody thought of everything,
there'd be nothing left for anybody else to think about."</p>

<p>"Look at the nests&mdash;aren't they pretty?" said Phyllis,
reaching across Peter to grasp a nest.</p>

<p>"Look out, Phil, you goat," said her brother. But it was too
late; her strong little fingers had crushed the nest.</p>

<p>"There now," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> one of my own," said Phyllis, "so you needn't jaw,
Peter. Yes, we've put our initial names on the ones we've done, so
that the swallows will know who they've got to be so grateful to
and fond of."</p>

<p>"Swallows can't read, silly," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Silly yourself," retorted Phyllis; "how do you know?"</p>

<p>"Who thought of making the nests, anyhow?" shouted Peter.</p>

<p>"I did," screamed Phyllis.</p>

<p>"Nya," rejoined Peter, "you only thought of making hay ones and
sticking them in the ivy for the sparrows, and they'd have been
sopping <i>long</i> before egg-laying time. It was me said clay and
swallows."</p>

<p>"I don't care what you said."</p>

<p>"Look," said Bobbie, "I've made the nest all right again. Give
me the bit of stick to mark your initial name on it. But how can
you? Your letter and Peter's are the same. P. for Peter, P. for
Phyllis."</p>

<p>"I put F. for Phyllis," said the child of that name. "That's how
it sounds. The swallows wouldn't spell Phyllis with a P., I'm
certain-sure."</p>

<p>"They can't spell at all," Peter was still insisting.</p>

<p>"Then why do you see them always on Christmas cards and
valentines with letters round their necks? How would they know
where to go if they couldn't read?"</p>

<p>"That's only in pictures. You never saw one really with letters
round its neck."</p>

<p>"Well, I have a pigeon, then; at least Daddy told me they did.
Only it was under their wings and not round their necks, but it
comes to the same thing, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say," interrupted Bobbie, "there's to be a paperchase
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Who?" Peter asked.</p>

<p>"Grammar School. Perks thinks the hare will go along by the line
at first. We might go along the cutting. You can see a long way
from there."</p>

<p>The paperchase was found to be a more amusing subject of
conversation than the reading powers of swallows. Bobbie had hoped
it might be. And next morning Mother let them take their lunch and
go out for the day to see the paperchase.</p>

<p>"If we go to the cutting," said Peter, "we shall see the
workmen, even if we miss the paperchase."</p>

<p>Of course it had taken some time to get the line clear from the
rocks and earth and trees that had fallen on it when the great
landslip happened. That was the occasion, you will remember, when
the three children saved the train from being wrecked by waving six
little red-flannel-petticoat flags. It is always interesting to
watch people working, especially when they work with such
interesting things as spades and picks and shovels and planks and
barrows, when they have cindery red fires in iron pots with round
holes in them, and red lamps hanging near the works at night. Of
course the children were never out at night; but once, at dusk,
when Peter had got out of his bedroom skylight on to the roof, he
had seen the red lamp shining far away at the edge of the cutting.
The children had often been down to watch the work, and this day
the interest of picks and spades, and barrows being wheeled along
planks, completely put the paperchase out of their heads, so that
they quite jumped when a voice just behind them panted, "Let me
pass, please." It was the hare&mdash;a big-boned, loose-limbed boy,
with dark hair lying flat on a very damp forehead. The bag of torn
paper under his arm was fastened across one shoulder by a strap.
The children stood back. The hare ran along the line, and the
workmen leaned on their picks to watch him. He ran on steadily and
disappeared into the mouth of the tunnel.</p>

<p>"That's against the by-laws," said the foreman.</p>

<p>"Why worry?" said the oldest workman; "live and let live's what
I always say. Ain't you never been young yourself, Mr. Bates?"</p>

<p>"I ought to report him," said the foreman.</p>

<p>"Why spoil sport's what I always say."</p>

<p>"Passengers are forbidden to cross the line on any pretence,"
murmured the foreman, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"He ain't no passenger," said one of the workmen.</p>

<p>"Nor 'e ain't crossed the line, not where we could see 'im do
it," said another.</p>

<p>"Nor yet 'e ain't made no pretences," said a third.</p>

<p>"And," said the oldest workman, "'e's outer sight now. What the
eye don't see the 'art needn't take no notice of's what I always
say."</p>

<p>And now, following the track of the hare by the little white
blots of scattered paper, came the hounds. There were thirty of
them, and they all came down the steep, ladder-like steps by ones
and twos and threes and sixes and sevens. Bobbie and Phyllis and
Peter counted them as they passed. The foremost ones hesitated a
moment at the foot of the ladder, then their eyes caught the gleam
of scattered whiteness along the line and they turned towards the
tunnel, and, by ones and twos and threes and sixes and sevens,
disappeared in the dark mouth of it. The last one, in a red jersey,
seemed to be extinguished by the darkness like a candle that is
blown out.</p>

<p>"They don't know what they're in for," said the foreman; "it
isn't so easy running in the dark. The tunnel takes two or three
turns."</p>

<p>"They'll take a long time to get through, you think?" Peter
asked.</p>

<p>"An hour or more, I shouldn't wonder."</p>

<p>"Then let's cut across the top and see them come out at the
other end," said Peter; "we shall get there long before they
do."</p>

<p>The counsel seemed good, and they went.</p>

<p>They climbed the steep steps from which they had picked the wild
cherry blossom for the grave of the little wild rabbit, and
reaching the top of the cutting, set their faces towards the hill
through which the tunnel was cut. It was stiff work.</p>

<p>"It's like Alps," said Bobbie, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Or Andes," said Peter.</p>

<p>"It's like Himmy what's its names?" gasped Phyllis. "Mount
Everlasting. Do let's stop."</p>

<p>"Stick to it," panted Peter; "you'll get your second wind in a
minute."</p>

<p>Phyllis consented to stick to it&mdash;and on they went, running
when the turf was smooth and the slope easy, climbing over stones,
helping themselves up rocks by the branches of trees, creeping
through narrow openings between tree trunks and rocks, and so on
and on, up and up, till at last they stood on the very top of the
hill where they had so often wished to be.</p>

<p>"Halt!" cried Peter, and threw himself flat on the grass. For
the very top of the hill was a smooth, turfed table-land, dotted
with mossy rocks and little mountain-ash trees.</p>

<p>The girls also threw themselves down flat.</p>

<p>"Plenty of time," Peter panted; "the rest's all down hill."</p>

<p>When they were rested enough to sit up and look round them,
Bobbie cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, look!"</p>

<p>"What at?" said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"The view," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"I hate views," said Phyllis, "don't you, Peter?"</p>

<p>"Let's get on," said Peter.</p>

<p>"But this isn't like a view they take you to in carriages when
you're at the seaside, all sea and sand and bare hills. It's like
the 'coloured counties' in one of Mother's poetry books."</p>

<p>"It's not so dusty," said Peter; "look at the Aqueduct
straddling slap across the valley like a giant centipede, and then
the towns sticking their church spires up out of the trees like
pens out of an inkstand. <i>I</i> think it's more like:</p>

<blockquote>"There could he see the banners<br>
Of twelve fair cities shine."</blockquote>

<p>"I love it," said Bobbie; "it's worth the climb."</p>

<p>"The paperchase is worth the climb," said Phyllis, "if we don't
lose it. Let's get on. It's all down hill now."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> said that ten minutes ago," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I've</i> said it now," said Phyllis; "come on."</p>

<p>"Loads of time," said Peter. And there was. For when they had
got down to a level with the top of the tunnel's mouth&mdash;they
were a couple of hundred yards out of their reckoning and had to
creep along the face of the hill&mdash;there was no sign of the
hare or the hounds.</p>

<p>"They've gone long ago, of course," said Phyllis, as they leaned
on the brick parapet above the tunnel.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Bobbie, "but even if they had, it's
ripping here, and we shall see the trains come out of the tunnel
like dragons out of lairs. We've never seen that from the top side
before."</p>

<p>"No more we have," said Phyllis, partially appeased.</p>

<p>It was really a most exciting place to be in. The top of the
tunnel seemed ever so much farther from the line than they had
expected, and it was like being on a bridge, but a bridge overgrown
with bushes and creepers and grass and wild-flowers.</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> the paperchase has gone long ago," said Phyllis
every two minutes, and she hardly knew whether she was pleased or
disappointed when Peter, leaning over the parapet, suddenly
cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look out. Here he comes!"</p>

<p>They all leaned over the sun-warmed brick wall in time to see
the hare, going very slowly, come out from the shadow of the
tunnel.</p>

<p>"There, now," said Peter, "what did I tell you? Now for the
hounds!"</p>

<p>Very soon came the hounds&mdash;by ones and twos and threes and
sixes and sevens&mdash;and they also were going slowly and seemed
very tired. Two or three who lagged far behind came out long after
the others.</p>

<p>"There," said Bobbie, "that's all&mdash;now what shall we
do?"</p>

<p>"Go along into the tulgy wood over there and have lunch," said
Phyllis; "we can see them for miles from up here."</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Peter. "That's not the last. There's the one in
the red jersey to come yet. Let's see the last of them come
out."</p>

<p>But though they waited and waited and waited, the boy in the red
jersey did not appear.</p>

<p>"Oh, let's have lunch," said Phyllis; "I've got a pain in my
front with being so hungry. You must have missed seeing the
red-jerseyed one when he came out with the others&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Bobbie and Peter agreed that he had not come out with the
others.</p>

<p>"Let's get down to the tunnel mouth," said Peter; "then perhaps
we shall see him coming along from the inside. I expect he felt
spun-chuck, and rested in one of the manholes. You stay up here and
watch, Bob, and when I signal from below, you come down. We might
miss seeing him on the way down, with all these trees."</p>

<p>So the others climbed down and Bobbie waited till they signalled
to her from the line below. And then she, too, scrambled down the
roundabout slippery path among roots and moss till she stepped out
between two dogwood trees and joined the others on the line. And
still there was no sign of the hound with the red jersey.</p>

<p>"Oh, do, <i>do</i> let's have something to eat," wailed Phyllis.
"I shall die if you don't, and then you'll be sorry."</p>

<p>"Give her the sandwiches, for goodness' sake, and stop her silly
mouth," said Peter, not quite unkindly. "Look here," he added,
turning to Bobbie, "perhaps we'd better have one each, too. We may
need all our strength. Not more than one, though. There's no
time."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Bobbie, her mouth already full, for she was just
as hungry as Phyllis.</p>

<p>"Don't you see," replied Peter, impressively, "that red-jerseyed
hound has had an accident&mdash;that's what it is. Perhaps even as
we speak he's lying with his head on the metals, an unresisting
prey to any passing express&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't try to talk like a book," cried Bobbie, bolting what
was left of her sandwich; "come on. Phil, keep close behind me, and
if a train comes, stand flat against the tunnel wall and hold your
petticoats close to you."</p>

<p>"Give me one more sandwich," pleaded Phyllis, "and I will."</p>

<p>"I'm going first," said Peter; "it was my idea," and he
went.</p>

<p>Of course you know what going into a tunnel is like? The engine
gives a scream and then suddenly the noise of the running, rattling
train changes and grows different and much louder. Grown-up people
pull up the windows and hold them by the strap. The railway
carriage suddenly grows like night&mdash;with lamps, of course,
unless you are in a slow local train, in which case lamps are not
always provided. Then by and by the darkness outside the carriage
window is touched by puffs of cloudy whiteness, then you see a blue
light on the walls of the tunnel, then the sound of the moving
train changes once more, and you are out in the good open air
again, and grown-ups let the straps go. The windows, all dim with
the yellow breath of the tunnel, rattle down into their places, and
you see once more the dip and catch of the telegraph wires beside
the line, and the straight-cut hawthorn hedges with the tiny baby
trees growing up out of them every thirty yards.</p>

<p>All this, of course, is what a tunnel means when you are in a
train. But everything is quite different when you walk into a
tunnel on your own feet, and tread on shifting, sliding stones and
gravel on a path that curves downwards from the shining metals to
the wall. Then you see slimy, oozy trickles of water running down
the inside of the tunnel, and you notice that the bricks are not
red or brown, as they are at the tunnel's mouth, but dull, sticky,
sickly green. Your voice, when you speak, is quite changed from
what it was out in the sunshine, and it is a long time before the
tunnel is quite dark.</p>

<p>It was not yet quite dark in the tunnel when Phyllis caught at
Bobbie's skirt, ripping out half a yard of gathers, but no one
noticed this at the time.</p>

<p>"I want to go back," she said, "I don't like it. It'll be pitch
dark in a minute. I <i>won't</i> go on in the dark. I don't care
what you say, I <i>won't</i>."</p>

<p>"Don't be a silly cuckoo," said Peter; "I've got a candle end
and matches, and&mdash;what's that?"</p>

<p>"That" was a low, humming sound on the railway line, a trembling
of the wires beside it, a buzzing, humming sound that grew louder
and louder as they listened.</p>

<p>"It's a train," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Which line?"</p>

<p>"Let me go back," cried Phyllis, struggling to get away from the
hand by which Bobbie held her.</p>

<p>"Don't be a coward," said Bobbie; "it's quite safe. Stand
back."</p>

<p>"Come on," shouted Peter, who was a few yards ahead. "Quick!
Manhole!"</p>

<p>The roar of the advancing train was now louder than the noise
you hear when your head is under water in the bath and both taps
are running, and you are kicking with your heels against the bath's
tin sides. But Peter had shouted for all he was worth, and Bobbie
heard him. She dragged Phyllis along to the manhole. Phyllis, of
course, stumbled over the wires and grazed both her legs. But they
dragged her in, and all three stood in the dark, damp, arched
recess while the train roared louder and louder. It seemed as if it
would deafen them. And, in the distance, they could see its eyes of
fire growing bigger and brighter every instant.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> a dragon&mdash;I always knew it was&mdash;it takes
its own shape in here, in the dark," shouted Phyllis. But nobody
heard her. You see the train was shouting, too, and its voice was
bigger than hers.</p>

<p>And now, with a rush and a roar and a rattle and a long dazzling
flash of lighted carriage windows, a smell of smoke, and blast of
hot air, the train hurtled by, clanging and jangling and echoing in
the vaulted roof of the tunnel. Phyllis and Bobbie clung to each
other. Even Peter caught hold of Bobbie's arm, "in case she should
be frightened," as he explained afterwards.</p>

<p>And now, slowly and gradually, the tail-lights grew smaller and
smaller, and so did the noise, till with one last <i>whiz</i> the
train got itself out of the tunnel, and silence settled again on
its damp walls and dripping roof.</p>

<p>"<i>Oh</i>!" said the children, all together in a whisper.</p>

<p>Peter was lighting the candle end with a hand that trembled.</p>

<p>"Come on," he said; but he had to clear his throat before he
could speak in his natural voice.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Phyllis, "if the red-jerseyed one was in the way of
the train!"</p>

<p>"We've got to go and see," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Couldn't we go and send someone from the station?" said
Phyllis.</p>

<p>"Would you rather wait here for us?" asked Bobbie, severely, and
of course that settled the question.</p>

<p>So the three went on into the deeper darkness of the tunnel.
Peter led, holding his candle end high to light the way. The grease
ran down his fingers, and some of it right up his sleeve. He found
a long streak from wrist to elbow when he went to bed that
night.</p>

<p>It was not more than a hundred and fifty yards from the spot
where they had stood while the train went by that Peter stood
still, shouted "Hullo," and then went on much quicker than before.
When the others caught him up, he stopped. And he stopped within a
yard of what they had come into the tunnel to look for. Phyllis saw
a gleam of red, and shut her eyes tight. There, by the curved,
pebbly down line, was the red-jerseyed hound. His back was against
the wall, his arms hung limply by his sides, and his eyes were
shut.</p>

<p>"Was the red, blood? Is he all killed?" asked Phyllis, screwing
her eyelids more tightly together.</p>

<p>"Killed? Nonsense!" said Peter. "There's nothing red about him
except his jersey. He's only fainted. What on earth are we to
do?"</p>

<p>"Can we move him?" asked Bobbie.</p>

<p>"I don't know; he's a big chap."</p>

<p>"Suppose we bathe his forehead with water. No, I know we haven't
any, but milk's just as wet. There's a whole bottle."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter, "and they rub people's hands, I believe."</p>

<p>"They burn feathers, I know," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"What's the good of saying that when we haven't any
feathers?"</p>

<p>"As it happens," said Phyllis, in a tone of exasperated triumph,
"I've got a shuttlecock in my pocket. So there!"</p>

<p>And now Peter rubbed the hands of the red-jerseyed one. Bobbie
burned the feathers of the shuttlecock one by one under his nose,
Phyllis splashed warmish milk on his forehead, and all three kept
on saying as fast and as earnestly as they could:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, look up, speak to me! For my sake, speak!"</p>

<h2>Chapter XII. What Bobbie brought home.</h2>

<p>"Oh, look up! Speak to me! For <i>my</i> sake, speak!" The
children said the words over and over again to the unconscious
hound in a red jersey, who sat with closed eyes and pale face
against the side of the tunnel.</p>

<p>"Wet his ears with milk," said Bobbie. "I know they do it to
people that faint&mdash;with <i>eau-de-Cologne</i>. But I expect
milk's just as good."</p>

<p>So they wetted his ears, and some of the milk ran down his neck
under the red jersey. It was very dark in the tunnel. The candle
end Peter had carried, and which now burned on a flat stone, gave
hardly any light at all.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>do</i> look up," said Phyllis. "For <i>my</i> sake! I
believe he's dead."</p>

<p>"For <i>my</i> sake," repeated Bobbie. "No, he isn't."</p>

<p>"For <i>any</i> sake," said Peter; "come out of it." And he
shook the sufferer by the arm.</p>

<p>And then the boy in the red jersey sighed, and opened his eyes,
and shut them again and said in a very small voice, "Chuck it."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's <i>not</i> dead," said Phyllis. "I <i>knew</i> he
wasn't," and she began to cry.</p>

<p>"What's up? I'm all right," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Drink this," said Peter, firmly, thrusting the nose of the milk
bottle into the boy's mouth. The boy struggled, and some of the
milk was upset before he could get his mouth free to
say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's milk," said Peter. "Fear not, you are in the hands of
friends. Phil, you stop bleating this minute."</p>

<p>"Do drink it," said Bobbie, gently; "it'll do you good."</p>

<p>So he drank. And the three stood by without speaking to him.</p>

<p>"Let him be a minute," Peter whispered; "he'll be all right as
soon as the milk begins to run like fire through his veins."</p>

<p>He was.</p>

<p>"I'm better now," he announced. "I remember all about it." He
tried to move, but the movement ended in a groan. "Bother! I
believe I've broken my leg," he said.</p>

<p>"Did you tumble down?" asked Phyllis, sniffing.</p>

<p>"Of course not&mdash;I'm not a kiddie," said the boy,
indignantly; "it was one of those beastly wires tripped me up, and
when I tried to get up again I couldn't stand, so I sat down. Gee
whillikins! it does hurt, though. How did <i>you</i> get here?"</p>

<p>"We saw you all go into the tunnel and then we went across the
hill to see you all come out. And the others did&mdash;all but you,
and you didn't. So we are a rescue party," said Peter, with
pride.</p>

<p>"You've got some pluck, I will say," remarked the boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nothing," said Peter, with modesty. "Do you think
you could walk if we helped you?"</p>

<p>"I could try," said the boy.</p>

<p>He did try. But he could only stand on one foot; the other
dragged in a very nasty way.</p>

<p>"Here, let me sit down. I feel like dying," said the boy. "Let
go of me&mdash;let go, quick&mdash;" He lay down and closed his
eyes. The others looked at each other by the dim light of the
little candle.</p>

<p>"What on earth!" said Peter.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Bobbie, quickly, "you must go and get help. Go
to the nearest house."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the only thing," said Peter. "Come on."</p>

<p>"If you take his feet and Phil and I take his head, we could
carry him to the manhole."</p>

<p>They did it. It was perhaps as well for the sufferer that he had
fainted again.</p>

<p>"Now," said Bobbie, "I'll stay with him. You take the longest
bit of candle, and, oh&mdash;be quick, for this bit won't burn
long."</p>

<p>"I don't think Mother would like me leaving you," said Peter,
doubtfully. "Let me stay, and you and Phil go."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Bobbie, "you and Phil go&mdash;and lend me your
knife. I'll try to get his boot off before he wakes up again."</p>

<p>"I hope it's all right what we're doing," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Of course it's right," said Bobbie, impatiently. "What else
<i>would</i> you do? Leave him here all alone because it's dark?
Nonsense. Hurry up, that's all."</p>

<p>So they hurried up.</p>

<p>Bobbie watched their dark figures and the little light of the
little candle with an odd feeling of having come to the end of
everything. She knew now, she thought, what nuns who were bricked
up alive in convent walls felt like. Suddenly she gave herself a
little shake.</p>

<p>"Don't be a silly little girl," she said. She was always very
angry when anyone else called her a little girl, even if the
adjective that went first was not "silly" but "nice" or "good" or
"clever." And it was only when she was very angry with herself that
she allowed Roberta to use that expression to Bobbie.</p>

<p>She fixed the little candle end on a broken brick near the
red-jerseyed boy's feet. Then she opened Peter's knife. It was
always hard to manage&mdash;a halfpenny was generally needed to get
it open at all. This time Bobbie somehow got it open with her
thumbnail. She broke the nail, and it hurt horribly. Then she cut
the boy's bootlace, and got the boot off. She tried to pull off his
stocking, but his leg was dreadfully swollen, and it did not seem
to be the proper shape. So she cut the stocking down, very slowly
and carefully. It was a brown, knitted stocking, and she wondered
who had knitted it, and whether it was the boy's mother, and
whether she was feeling anxious about him, and how she would feel
when he was brought home with his leg broken. When Bobbie had got
the stocking off and saw the poor leg, she felt as though the
tunnel was growing darker, and the ground felt unsteady, and
nothing seemed quite real.</p>

<p>"<i>Silly</i> little girl!" said Roberta to Bobbie, and felt
better.</p>

<p>"The poor leg," she told herself; "it ought to have a
cushion&mdash;ah!"</p>

<p>She remembered the day when she and Phyllis had torn up their
red flannel petticoats to make danger signals to stop the train and
prevent an accident. Her flannel petticoat to-day was white, but it
would be quite as soft as a red one. She took it off.</p>

<p>"Oh, what useful things flannel petticoats are!" she said; "the
man who invented them ought to have a statue directed to him." And
she said it aloud, because it seemed that any voice, even her own,
would be a comfort in that darkness.</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> ought to be directed? Who to?" asked the boy,
suddenly and very feebly.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Bobbie, "now you're better! Hold your teeth and don't
let it hurt too much. Now!"</p>

<p>She had folded the petticoat, and lifting his leg laid it on the
cushion of folded flannel.</p>

<p>"Don't faint again, <i>please</i> don't," said Bobbie, as he
groaned. She hastily wetted her handkerchief with milk and spread
it over the poor leg.</p>

<p>"Oh, that hurts," cried the boy, shrinking. "Oh&mdash;no, it
doesn't&mdash; it's nice, really."</p>

<p>"What's your name?" said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Jim."</p>

<p>"Mine's Bobbie."</p>

<p>"But you're a girl, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my long name's Roberta."</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;Bobbie."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't there some more of you just now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Peter and Phil&mdash;that's my brother and sister. They've
gone to get someone to carry you out."</p>

<p>"What rum names. All boys'."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I wish I was a boy, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I think you're all right as you are."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that&mdash;I meant don't you wish <i>you</i> were
a boy, but of course you are without wishing."</p>

<p>"You're just as brave as a boy. Why didn't you go with the
others?"</p>

<p>"Somebody had to stay with you," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Tell you what, Bobbie," said Jim, "you're a brick. Shake." He
reached out a red-jerseyed arm and Bobbie squeezed his hand.</p>

<p>"I won't shake it," she explained, "because it would shake
<i>you</i>, and that would shake your poor leg, and that would
hurt. Have you got a hanky?"</p>

<p>"I don't expect I have." He felt in his pocket. "Yes, I have.
What for?"</p>

<p>She took it and wetted it with milk and put it on his
forehead.</p>

<p>"That's jolly," he said; "what is it?"</p>

<p>"Milk," said Bobbie. "We haven't any water&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're a jolly good little nurse," said Jim.</p>

<p>"I do it for Mother sometimes," said Bobbie&mdash;"not milk, of
course, but scent, or vinegar and water. I say, I must put the
candle out now, because there mayn't be enough of the other one to
get you out by."</p>

<p>"By George," said he, "you think of everything."</p>

<p>Bobbie blew. Out went the candle. You have no idea how
black-velvety the darkness was.</p>

<p>"I say, Bobbie," said a voice through the blackness, "aren't you
afraid of the dark?"</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;not very, that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let's hold hands," said the boy, and it was really rather good
of him, because he was like most boys of his age and hated all
material tokens of affection, such as kissing and holding of hands.
He called all such things "pawings," and detested them.</p>

<p>The darkness was more bearable to Bobbie now that her hand was
held in the large rough hand of the red-jerseyed sufferer; and he,
holding her little smooth hot paw, was surprised to find that he
did not mind it so much as he expected. She tried to talk, to amuse
him, and "take his mind off" his sufferings, but it is very
difficult to go on talking in the dark, and presently they found
themselves in a silence, only broken now and then by a&mdash;</p>

<p>"You all right, Bobbie?"</p>

<p>or an&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's hurting you most awfully, Jim. I <i>am</i> so
sorry."</p>

<p>And it was very cold.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Peter and Phyllis tramped down the long way of the tunnel
towards daylight, the candle-grease dripping over Peter's fingers.
There were no accidents unless you count Phyllis's catching her
frock on a wire, and tearing a long, jagged slit in it, and
tripping over her bootlace when it came undone, or going down on
her hands and knees, all four of which were grazed.</p>

<p>"There's no end to this tunnel," said Phyllis&mdash;and indeed
it did seem very very long.</p>

<p>"Stick to it," said Peter; "everything has an end, and you get
to it if you only keep all on."</p>

<p>Which is quite true, if you come to think of it, and a useful
thing to remember in seasons of trouble&mdash;such as measles,
arithmetic, impositions, and those times when you are in disgrace,
and feel as though no one would ever love you again, and you could
never&mdash;never again&mdash;love anybody.</p>

<p>"Hurray," said Peter, suddenly, "there's the end of the
tunnel&mdash; looks just like a pin-hole in a bit of black paper,
doesn't it?"</p>

<p>The pin-hole got larger&mdash;blue lights lay along the sides of
the tunnel. The children could see the gravel way that lay in front
of them; the air grew warmer and sweeter. Another twenty steps and
they were out in the good glad sunshine with the green trees on
both sides.</p>

<p>Phyllis drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"I'll never go into a tunnel again as long as ever I live," said
she, "not if there are twenty hundred thousand millions hounds
inside with red jerseys and their legs broken."</p>

<p>"Don't be a silly cuckoo," said Peter, as usual. "You'd
<i>have</i> to."</p>

<p>"I think it was very brave and good of me," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"Not it," said Peter; "you didn't go because you were brave, but
because Bobbie and I aren't skunks. Now where's the nearest house,
I wonder? You can't see anything here for the trees."</p>

<p>"There's a roof over there," said Phyllis, pointing down the
line.</p>

<p>"That's the signal-box," said Peter, "and you know you're not
allowed to speak to signalmen on duty. It's wrong."</p>

<p>"I'm not near so afraid of doing wrong as I was of going into
that tunnel," said Phyllis. "Come on," and she started to run along
the line. So Peter ran, too.</p>

<p>It was very hot in the sunshine, and both children were hot and
breathless by the time they stopped, and bending their heads back
to look up at the open windows of the signal-box, shouted "Hi!" as
loud as their breathless state allowed. But no one answered. The
signal-box stood quiet as an empty nursery, and the handrail of its
steps was hot to the hands of the children as they climbed softly
up. They peeped in at the open door. The signalman was sitting on a
chair tilted back against the wall. His head leaned sideways, and
his mouth was open. He was fast asleep.</p>

<p>"My hat!" cried Peter; "wake up!" And he cried it in a terrible
voice, for he knew that if a signalman sleeps on duty, he risks
losing his situation, let alone all the other dreadful risks to
trains which expect him to tell them when it is safe for them to go
their ways.</p>

<p>The signalman never moved. Then Peter sprang to him and shook
him. And slowly, yawning and stretching, the man awoke. But the
moment he <i>was</i> awake he leapt to his feet, put his hands to
his head "like a mad maniac," as Phyllis said afterwards, and
shouted:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my heavens&mdash;what's o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Twelve thirteen," said Peter, and indeed it was by the
white-faced, round-faced clock on the wall of the signal-box.</p>

<p>The man looked at the clock, sprang to the levers, and wrenched
them this way and that. An electric bell tingled&mdash;the wires
and cranks creaked, and the man threw himself into a chair. He was
very pale, and the sweat stood on his forehead "like large dewdrops
on a white cabbage," as Phyllis remarked later. He was trembling,
too; the children could see his big hairy hands shake from side to
side, "with quite extra-sized trembles," to use the subsequent
words of Peter. He drew long breaths. Then suddenly he cried,
"Thank God, thank God you come in when you did&mdash;oh, thank
God!" and his shoulders began to heave and his face grew red again,
and he hid it in those large hairy hands of his.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't cry&mdash;don't," said Phyllis, "it's all right now,"
and she patted him on one big, broad shoulder, while Peter
conscientiously thumped the other.</p>

<p>But the signalman seemed quite broken down, and the children had
to pat him and thump him for quite a long time before he found his
handkerchief&mdash;a red one with mauve and white horseshoes on
it&mdash;and mopped his face and spoke. During this patting and
thumping interval a train thundered by.</p>

<p>"I'm downright shamed, that I am," were the words of the big
signalman when he had stopped crying; "snivelling like a kid." Then
suddenly he seemed to get cross. "And what was you doing up here,
anyway?" he said; "you know it ain't allowed."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Phyllis, "we knew it was wrong&mdash;but I wasn't
afraid of doing wrong, and so it turned out right. You aren't sorry
we came."</p>

<p>"Lor' love you&mdash;if you hadn't 'a' come&mdash;" he stopped
and then went on. "It's a disgrace, so it is, sleeping on duty. If
it was to come to be known&mdash;even as it is, when no harm's come
of it."</p>

<p>"It won't come to be known," said Peter; "we aren't sneaks. All
the same, you oughtn't to sleep on duty&mdash;it's dangerous."</p>

<p>"Tell me something I don't know," said the man, "but I can't
help it. I know'd well enough just how it 'ud be. But I couldn't
get off. They couldn't get no one to take on my duty. I tell you I
ain't had ten minutes' sleep this last five days. My little chap's
ill&mdash;pewmonia, the Doctor says&mdash;and there's no one but me
and 'is little sister to do for him. That's where it is. The gell
must 'ave her sleep. Dangerous? Yes, I believe you. Now go and
split on me if you like."</p>

<p>"Of course we won't," said Peter, indignantly, but Phyllis
ignored the whole of the signalman's speech, except the first six
words.</p>

<p>"You asked us," she said, "to tell you something you don't know.
Well, I will. There's a boy in the tunnel over there with a red
jersey and his leg broken."</p>

<p>"What did he want to go into the blooming tunnel for, then?"
said the man.</p>

<p>"Don't you be so cross," said Phyllis, kindly. "<i>We</i>
haven't done anything wrong except coming and waking you up, and
that was right, as it happens."</p>

<p>Then Peter told how the boy came to be in the tunnel.</p>

<p>"Well," said the man, "I don't see as I can do anything. I can't
leave the box."</p>

<p>"You might tell us where to go after someone who isn't in a box,
though," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"There's Brigden's farm over yonder&mdash;where you see the
smoke a-coming up through the trees," said the man, more and more
grumpy, as Phyllis noticed.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye, then," said Peter.</p>

<p>But the man said, "Wait a minute." He put his hand in his pocket
and brought out some money&mdash;a lot of pennies and one or two
shillings and sixpences and half-a-crown. He picked out two
shillings and held them out.</p>

<p>"Here," he said. "I'll give you this to hold your tongues about
what's taken place to-day."</p>

<p>There was a short, unpleasant pause. Then:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> a nasty man, though, aren't you?" said
Phyllis.</p>

<p>Peter took a step forward and knocked the man's hand up, so that
the shillings leapt out of it and rolled on the floor.</p>

<p>"If anything <i>could</i> make me sneak, <i>that</i> would!" he
said. "Come, Phil," and marched out of the signal-box with flaming
cheeks.</p>

<p>Phyllis hesitated. Then she took the hand, still held out
stupidly, that the shillings had been in.</p>

<p>"I forgive you," she said, "even if Peter doesn't. You're not in
your proper senses, or you'd never have done that. I know want of
sleep sends people mad. Mother told me. I hope your little boy will
soon be better, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come on, Phil," cried Peter, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I give you my sacred honour-word we'll never tell anyone. Kiss
and be friends," said Phyllis, feeling how noble it was of her to
try to make up a quarrel in which she was not to blame.</p>

<p>The signalman stooped and kissed her.</p>

<p>"I do believe I'm a bit off my head, Sissy," he said. "Now run
along home to Mother. I didn't mean to put you
about&mdash;there."</p>

<p>So Phil left the hot signal-box and followed Peter across the
fields to the farm.</p>

<p>When the farm men, led by Peter and Phyllis and carrying a
hurdle covered with horse-cloths, reached the manhole in the
tunnel, Bobbie was fast asleep and so was Jim. Worn out with the
pain, the Doctor said afterwards.</p>

<p>"Where does he live?" the bailiff from the farm asked, when Jim
had been lifted on to the hurdle.</p>

<p>"In Northumberland," answered Bobbie.</p>

<p>"I'm at school at Maidbridge," said Jim. "I suppose I've got to
get back there, somehow."</p>

<p>"Seems to me the Doctor ought to have a look in first," said the
bailiff.</p>

<p>"Oh, bring him up to our house," said Bobbie. "It's only a
little way by the road. I'm sure Mother would say we ought to."</p>

<p>"Will your Ma like you bringing home strangers with broken
legs?"</p>

<p>"She took the poor Russian home herself," said Bobbie. "I know
she'd say we ought."</p>

<p>"All right," said the bailiff, "you ought to know what your Ma
'ud like. I wouldn't take it upon me to fetch him up to our place
without I asked the Missus first, and they call me the Master,
too."</p>

<p>"Are you sure your Mother won't mind?" whispered Jim.</p>

<p>"Certain," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Then we're to take him up to Three Chimneys?" said the
bailiff.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Then my lad shall nip up to Doctor's on his bike, and tell him
to come down there. Now, lads, lift him quiet and steady. One, two,
three!"</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Mother, writing away for dear life at a
story about a Duchess, a designing villain, a secret passage, and a
missing will, dropped her pen as her work-room door burst open, and
turned to see Bobbie hatless and red with running.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother," she cried, "do come down. We found a hound in a
red jersey in the tunnel, and he's broken his leg and they're
bringing him home."</p>

<p>"They ought to take him to the vet," said Mother, with a worried
frown; "I really <i>can't</i> have a lame dog here."</p>

<p>"He's not a dog, really&mdash;he's a boy," said Bobbie, between
laughing and choking.</p>

<p>"Then he ought to be taken home to his mother."</p>

<p>"His mother's dead," said Bobbie, "and his father's in
Northumberland. Oh, Mother, you will be nice to him? I told him I
was sure you'd want us to bring him home. You always want to help
everybody."</p>

<p>Mother smiled, but she sighed, too. It is nice that your
children should believe you willing to open house and heart to any
and every one who needs help. But it is rather embarrassing
sometimes, too, when they act on their belief.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Mother, "we must make the best of it."</p>

<p>When Jim was carried in, dreadfully white and with set lips
whose red had faded to a horrid bluey violet colour, Mother
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am glad you brought him here. Now, Jim, let's get you
comfortable in bed before the Doctor comes!"</p>

<p>And Jim, looking at her kind eyes, felt a little, warm,
comforting flush of new courage.</p>

<p>"It'll hurt rather, won't it?" he said. "I don't mean to be a
coward. You won't think I'm a coward if I faint again, will you? I
really and truly don't do it on purpose. And I do hate to give you
all this trouble."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry," said Mother; "it's you that have the trouble,
you poor dear&mdash;not us."</p>

<p>And she kissed him just as if he had been Peter. "We love to
have you here&mdash;don't we, Bobbie?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bobbie&mdash;and she saw by her Mother's face how
right she had been to bring home the wounded hound in the red
jersey.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIII. The hound's grandfather.</h2>

<p>Mother did not get back to her writing all that day, for the
red-jerseyed hound whom the children had brought to Three Chimneys
had to be put to bed. And then the Doctor came, and hurt him most
horribly. Mother was with him all through it, and that made it a
little better than it would have been, but "bad was the best," as
Mrs. Viney said.</p>

<p>The children sat in the parlour downstairs and heard the sound
of the Doctor's boots going backwards and forwards over the bedroom
floor. And once or twice there was a groan.</p>

<p>"It's horrible," said Bobbie. "Oh, I wish Dr. Forrest would make
haste. Oh, poor Jim!"</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> horrible," said Peter, "but it's very exciting. I
wish Doctors weren't so stuck-up about who they'll have in the room
when they're doing things. I should most awfully like to see a leg
set. I believe the bones crunch like anything."</p>

<p>"Don't!" said the two girls at once.</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" said Peter. "How are you going to be Red Cross
Nurses, like you were talking of coming home, if you can't even
stand hearing me say about bones crunching? You'd have to
<i>hear</i> them crunch on the field of battle&mdash;and be steeped
in gore up to the elbows as likely as not, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop it!" cried Bobbie, with a white face; "you don't know how
funny you're making me feel."</p>

<p>"Me, too," said Phyllis, whose face was pink.</p>

<p>"Cowards!" said Peter.</p>

<p>"I'm not," said Bobbie. "I helped Mother with your rake-wounded
foot, and so did Phil&mdash;you know we did."</p>

<p>"Well, then!" said Peter. "Now look here. It would be a jolly
good thing for you if I were to talk to you every day for half an
hour about broken bones and people's insides, so as to get you used
to it."</p>

<p>A chair was moved above.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Peter, "that's the bone crunching."</p>

<p>"I do wish you wouldn't," said Phyllis. "Bobbie doesn't like
it."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what they do," said Peter. I can't think what
made him so horrid. Perhaps it was because he had been so very nice
and kind all the earlier part of the day, and now he had to have a
change. This is called reaction. One notices it now and then in
oneself. Sometimes when one has been extra good for a longer time
than usual, one is suddenly attacked by a violent fit of not being
good at all. "I'll tell you what they do," said Peter; "they strap
the broken man down so that he can't resist or interfere with their
doctorish designs, and then someone holds his head, and someone
holds his leg&mdash;the broken one, and pulls it till the bones fit
in&mdash; with a crunch, mind you! Then they strap it up
and&mdash;let's play at bone-setting!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Phyllis.</p>

<p>But Bobbie said suddenly: "All right&mdash;<i>let's</i>! I'll be
the doctor, and Phil can be the nurse. You can be the broken boner;
we can get at your legs more easily, because you don't wear
petticoats."</p>

<p>"I'll get the splints and bandages," said Peter; "you get the
couch of suffering ready."</p>

<p>The ropes that had tied up the boxes that had come from home
were all in a wooden packing-case in the cellar. When Peter brought
in a trailing tangle of them, and two boards for splints, Phyllis
was excitedly giggling.</p>

<p>"Now, then," he said, and lay down on the settle, groaning most
grievously.</p>

<p>"Not so loud!" said Bobbie, beginning to wind the rope round him
and the settle. "You pull, Phil."</p>

<p>"Not so tight," moaned Peter. "You'll break my other leg."</p>

<p>Bobbie worked on in silence, winding more and more rope round
him.</p>

<p>"That's enough," said Peter. "I can't move at all. Oh, my poor
leg!" He groaned again.</p>

<p>"<i>Sure</i> you can't move?" asked Bobbie, in a rather strange
tone.</p>

<p>"Quite sure," replied Peter. "Shall we play it's bleeding freely
or not?" he asked cheerfully.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> can play what you like," said Bobbie, sternly,
folding her arms and looking down at him where he lay all wound
round and round with cord. "Phil and I are going away. And we
shan't untie you till you promise never, never to talk to us about
blood and wounds unless we say you may. Come, Phil!"</p>

<p>"You beast!" said Peter, writhing. "I'll never promise, never.
I'll yell, and Mother will come."</p>

<p>"Do," said Bobbie, "and tell her why we tied you up! Come on,
Phil. No, I'm not a beast, Peter. But you wouldn't stop when we
asked you and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yah," said Peter, "it wasn't even your own idea. You got it out
of Stalky!"</p>

<p>Bobbie and Phil, retiring in silent dignity, were met at the
door by the Doctor. He came in rubbing his hands and looking
pleased with himself.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "<i>that</i> job's done. It's a nice clean
fracture, and it'll go on all right, I've no doubt. Plucky young
chap, too&mdash; hullo! what's all this?"</p>

<p>His eye had fallen on Peter who lay mousy-still in his bonds on
the settle.</p>

<p>"Playing at prisoners, eh?" he said; but his eyebrows had gone
up a little. Somehow he had not thought that Bobbie would be
playing while in the room above someone was having a broken bone
set.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Bobbie, "not at <i>prisoners</i>. We were playing
at setting bones. Peter's the broken boner, and I was the
doctor."</p>

<p>The Doctor frowned.</p>

<p>"Then I must say," he said, and he said it rather sternly,
"that's it's a very heartless game. Haven't you enough imagination
even to faintly picture what's been going on upstairs? That poor
chap, with the drops of sweat on his forehead, and biting his lips
so as not to cry out, and every touch on his leg agony
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> ought to be tied up," said Phyllis; "you're as bad
as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush," said Bobbie; "I'm sorry, but we weren't heartless,
really."</p>

<p>"I was, I suppose," said Peter, crossly. "All right, Bobbie,
don't you go on being noble and screening me, because I jolly well
won't have it. It was only that I kept on talking about blood and
wounds. I wanted to train them for Red Cross Nurses. And I wouldn't
stop when they asked me."</p>

<p>"Well?" said Dr. Forrest, sitting down.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;then I said, 'Let's play at setting bones.' It was
all rot. I knew Bobbie wouldn't. I only said it to tease her. And
then when she said 'yes,' of course I had to go through with it.
And they tied me up. They got it out of Stalky. And I think it's a
beastly shame."</p>

<p>He managed to writhe over and hide his face against the wooden
back of the settle.</p>

<p>"I didn't think that anyone would know but us," said Bobbie,
indignantly answering Peter's unspoken reproach. "I never thought
of your coming in. And hearing about blood and wounds does really
make me feel most awfully funny. It was only a joke our tying him
up. Let me untie you, Pete."</p>

<p>"I don't care if you never untie me," said Peter; "and if that's
your idea of a joke&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I were you," said the Doctor, though really he did not quite
know what to say, "I should be untied before your Mother comes
down. You don't want to worry her just now, do you?"</p>

<p>"I don't promise anything about not saying about wounds, mind,"
said Peter, in very surly tones, as Bobbie and Phyllis began to
untie the knots.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, Pete," Bobbie whispered, leaning close to him
as she fumbled with the big knot under the settle; "but if you only
knew how sick you made me feel."</p>

<p>"You've made <i>me</i> feel pretty sick, I can tell you," Peter
rejoined. Then he shook off the loose cords, and stood up.</p>

<p>"I looked in," said Dr. Forrest, "to see if one of you would
come along to the surgery. There are some things that your Mother
will want at once, and I've given my man a day off to go and see
the circus; will you come, Peter?"</p>

<p>Peter went without a word or a look to his sisters.</p>

<p>The two walked in silence up to the gate that led from the Three
Chimneys field to the road. Then Peter said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let me carry your bag. I say, it is heavy&mdash;what's in
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, knives and lancets and different instruments for hurting
people. And the ether bottle. I had to give him ether, you
know&mdash; the agony was so intense."</p>

<p>Peter was silent.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about how you found that chap," said Dr.
Forrest.</p>

<p>Peter told. And then Dr. Forrest told him stories of brave
rescues; he was a most interesting man to talk to, as Peter had
often remarked.</p>

<p>Then in the surgery Peter had a better chance than he had ever
had of examining the Doctor's balance, and his microscope, and his
scales and measuring glasses. When all the things were ready that
Peter was to take back, the Doctor said suddenly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'll excuse my shoving my oar in, won't you? But I should
like to say something to you."</p>

<p>"Now for a rowing," thought Peter, who had been wondering how it
was that he had escaped one.</p>

<p>"Something scientific," added the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter, fiddling with the fossil ammonite that the
Doctor used for a paper-weight.</p>

<p>"Well then, you see. Boys and girls are only little men and
women. And <i>we</i> are much harder and hardier than they
are&mdash;" (Peter liked the "we." Perhaps the Doctor had known he
would.)&mdash;"and much stronger, and things that hurt <i>them</i>
don't hurt <i>us</i>. You know you mustn't hit a girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should think not, indeed," muttered Peter, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Not even if she's your own sister. That's because girls are so
much softer and weaker than we are; they have to be, you know," he
added, "because if they weren't, it wouldn't be nice for the
babies. And that's why all the animals are so good to the mother
animals. They never fight them, you know."</p>

<p>"I know," said Peter, interested; "two buck rabbits will fight
all day if you let them, but they won't hurt a doe."</p>

<p>"No; and quite wild beasts&mdash;lions and
elephants&mdash;they're immensely gentle with the female beasts.
And we've got to be, too."</p>

<p>"I see," said Peter.</p>

<p>"And their hearts are soft, too," the Doctor went on, "and
things that we shouldn't think anything of hurt them dreadfully. So
that a man has to be very careful, not only of his fists, but of
his words. They're awfully brave, you know," he went on. "Think of
Bobbie waiting alone in the tunnel with that poor chap. It's an odd
thing&mdash;the softer and more easily hurt a woman is the better
she can screw herself up to do what <i>has</i> to be done. I've
seen some brave women&mdash; your Mother's one," he ended
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter.</p>

<p>"Well, that's all. Excuse my mentioning it. But nobody knows
everything without being told. And you see what I mean, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter. "I'm sorry. There!"</p>

<p>"Of course you are! People always are&mdash;directly they
understand. Everyone ought to be taught these scientific facts. So
long!"</p>

<p>They shook hands heartily. When Peter came home, his sisters
looked at him doubtfully.</p>

<p>"It's Pax," said Peter, dumping down the basket on the table.
"Dr. Forrest has been talking scientific to me. No, it's no use my
telling you what he said; you wouldn't understand. But it all comes
to you girls being poor, soft, weak, frightened things like
rabbits, so us men have just got to put up with them. He said you
were female beasts. Shall I take this up to Mother, or will
you?"</p>

<p>"I know what <i>boys</i> are," said Phyllis, with flaming
cheeks; "they're just the nastiest, rudest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're very brave," said Bobbie, "sometimes."</p>

<p>"Ah, you mean the chap upstairs? I see. Go ahead, Phil&mdash;I
shall put up with you whatever you say because you're a poor, weak,
frightened, soft&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not if I pull your hair you won't," said Phyllis, springing at
him.</p>

<p>"He said 'Pax,'" said Bobbie, pulling her away. "Don't you see,"
she whispered as Peter picked up the basket and stalked out with
it, "he's sorry, really, only he won't say so? Let's say we're
sorry."</p>

<p>"It's so goody goody," said Phyllis, doubtfully; "he said we
were female beasts, and soft and frightened&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then let's show him we're not frightened of him thinking us
goody goody," said Bobbie; "and we're not any more beasts than he
is."</p>

<p>And when Peter came back, still with his chin in the air, Bobbie
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We're sorry we tied you up, Pete."</p>

<p>"I thought you would be," said Peter, very stiff and
superior.</p>

<p>This was hard to bear. But&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, so we are," said Bobbie. "Now let honour be satisfied on
both sides."</p>

<p>"I did call it Pax," said Peter, in an injured tone.</p>

<p>"Then let it <i>be</i> Pax," said Bobbie. "Come on, Phil, let's
get the tea. Pete, you might lay the cloth."</p>

<p>"I say," said Phyllis, when peace was really restored, which was
not till they were washing up the cups after tea, "Dr. Forrest
didn't <i>really</i> say we were female beasts, did he?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter, firmly, "but I think he meant we men were
wild beasts, too."</p>

<p>"How funny of him!" said Phyllis, breaking a cup.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>"May I come in, Mother?" Peter was at the door of Mother's
writing room, where Mother sat at her table with two candles in
front of her. Their flames looked orange and violet against the
clear grey blue of the sky where already a few stars were
twinkling.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said Mother, absently, "anything wrong?" She wrote
a few more words and then laid down her pen and began to fold up
what she had written. "I was just writing to Jim's grandfather. He
lives near here, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, you said so at tea. That's what I want to say. Must you
write to him, Mother? Couldn't we keep Jim, and not say anything to
his people till he's well? It would be such a surprise for
them."</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said Mother, laughing, "I think it would."</p>

<p>"You see," Peter went on, "of course the girls are all right and
all that&mdash;I'm not saying anything against <i>them</i>. But I
should like it if I had another chap to talk to sometimes."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mother, "I know it's dull for you, dear. But I can't
help it. Next year perhaps I can send you to school&mdash;you'd
like that, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"I do miss the other chaps, rather," Peter confessed; "but if
Jim could stay after his leg was well, we could have awful
larks."</p>

<p>"I've no doubt of it," said Mother. "Well&mdash;perhaps he
could, but you know, dear, we're not rich. I can't afford to get
him everything he'll want. And he must have a nurse."</p>

<p>"Can't you nurse him, Mother? You do nurse people so
beautifully."</p>

<p>"That's a pretty compliment, Pete&mdash;but I can't do nursing
and my writing as well. That's the worst of it."</p>

<p>"Then you <i>must</i> send the letter to his grandfather?"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;and to his schoolmaster, too. We telegraphed to
them both, but I must write as well. They'll be most dreadfully
anxious."</p>

<p>"I say, Mother, why can't his grandfather pay for a nurse?"
Peter suggested. "That would be ripping. I expect the old boy's
rolling in money. Grandfathers in books always are."</p>

<p>"Well, this one isn't in a book," said Mother, "so we mustn't
expect him to roll much."</p>

<p>"I say," said Peter, musingly, "wouldn't it be jolly if we all
<i>were</i> in a book, and you were writing it? Then you could make
all sorts of jolly things happen, and make Jim's legs get well at
once and be all right to-morrow, and Father come home soon
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you miss your Father very much?" Mother asked, rather
coldly, Peter thought.</p>

<p>"Awfully," said Peter, briefly.</p>

<p>Mother was enveloping and addressing the second letter.</p>

<p>"You see," Peter went on slowly, "you see, it's not only him
<i>being</i> Father, but now he's away there's no other man in the
house but me&mdash; that's why I want Jim to stay so frightfully
much. Wouldn't you like to be writing that book with us all in it,
Mother, and make Daddy come home soon?"</p>

<p>Peter's Mother put her arm round him suddenly, and hugged him in
silence for a minute. Then she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't you think it's rather nice to think that we're in a book
that God's writing? If I were writing the book, I might make
mistakes. But God knows how to make the story end just
right&mdash;in the way that's best for us."</p>

<p>"Do you really believe that, Mother?" Peter asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I do believe it&mdash;almost
always&mdash;except when I'm so sad that I can't believe anything.
But even when I can't believe it, I know it's true&mdash;and I try
to believe. You don't know how I try, Peter. Now take the letters
to the post, and don't let's be sad any more. Courage, courage!
That's the finest of all the virtues! I dare say Jim will be here
for two or three weeks yet."</p>

<p>For what was left of the evening Peter was so angelic that
Bobbie feared he was going to be ill. She was quite relieved in the
morning to find him plaiting Phyllis's hair on to the back of her
chair in quite his old manner.</p>

<p>It was soon after breakfast that a knock came at the door. The
children were hard at work cleaning the brass candlesticks in
honour of Jim's visit.</p>

<p>"That'll be the Doctor," said Mother; "I'll go. Shut the kitchen
door&mdash;you're not fit to be seen."</p>

<p>But it wasn't the Doctor. They knew that by the voice and by the
sound of the boots that went upstairs. They did not recognise the
sound of the boots, but everyone was certain that they had heard
the voice before.</p>

<p>There was a longish interval. The boots and the voice did not
come down again.</p>

<p>"Who can it possibly be?" they kept on asking themselves and
each other.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Peter at last, "Dr. Forrest has been attacked by
highwaymen and left for dead, and this is the man he's telegraphed
for to take his place. Mrs. Viney said he had a local tenant to do
his work when he went for a holiday, didn't you, Mrs. Viney?"</p>

<p>"I did so, my dear," said Mrs. Viney from the back kitchen.</p>

<p>"He's fallen down in a fit, more likely," said Phyllis, "all
human aid despaired of. And this is his man come to break the news
to Mother."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Peter, briskly; "Mother wouldn't have taken the
man up into Jim's bedroom. Why should she? Listen&mdash;the door's
opening. Now they'll come down. I'll open the door a crack."</p>

<p>He did.</p>

<p>"It's not listening," he replied indignantly to Bobbie's
scandalised remarks; "nobody in their senses would talk secrets on
the stairs. And Mother can't have secrets to talk with Dr.
Forrest's stable-man&mdash;and you said it was him."</p>

<p>"Bobbie," called Mother's voice.</p>

<p>They opened the kitchen door, and Mother leaned over the stair
railing.</p>

<p>"Jim's grandfather has come," she said; "wash your hands and
faces and then you can see him. He wants to see you!" The bedroom
door shut again.</p>

<p>"There now!" said Peter; "fancy us not even thinking of that!
Let's have some hot water, Mrs. Viney. I'm as black as your
hat."</p>

<p>The three were indeed dirty, for the stuff you clean brass
candlesticks with is very far from cleaning to the cleaner.</p>

<p>They were still busy with soap and flannel when they heard the
boots and the voice come down the stairs and go into the
dining-room. And when they were clean, though still
damp&mdash;because it takes such a long time to dry your hands
properly, and they were very impatient to see the
grandfather&mdash;they filed into the dining-room.</p>

<p>Mother was sitting in the window-seat, and in the
leather-covered armchair that Father always used to sit in at the
other house sat&mdash;</p>

<p>THEIR OWN OLD GENTLEMAN!</p>

<p>"Well, I never did," said Peter, even before he said, "How do
you do?" He was, as he explained afterwards, too surprised even to
remember that there was such a thing as politeness&mdash;much less
to practise it.</p>

<p>"It's our own old gentleman!" said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you!" said Bobbie. And then they remembered themselves
and their manners and said, "How do you do?" very nicely.</p>

<p>"This is Jim's grandfather, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;" said Mother,
naming the old gentleman's name.</p>

<p>"How splendid!" said Peter; "that's just exactly like a book,
isn't it, Mother?"</p>

<p>"It is, rather," said Mother, smiling; "things do happen in real
life that are rather like books, sometimes."</p>

<p>"I am so awfully glad it <i>is</i> you," said Phyllis; "when you
think of the tons of old gentlemen there are in the world&mdash;it
might have been almost anyone."</p>

<p>"I say, though," said Peter, "you're not going to take Jim away,
though, are you?"</p>

<p>"Not at present," said the old gentleman. "Your Mother has most
kindly consented to let him stay here. I thought of sending a
nurse, but your Mother is good enough to say that she will nurse
him herself."</p>

<p>"But what about her writing?" said Peter, before anyone could
stop him. "There won't be anything for him to eat if Mother doesn't
write."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Mother, hastily.</p>

<p>The old gentleman looked very kindly at Mother.</p>

<p>"I see," he said, "you trust your children, and confide in
them."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mother.</p>

<p>"Then I may tell them of our little arrangement," he said. "Your
Mother, my dears, has consented to give up writing for a little
while and to become a Matron of my Hospital."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Phyllis, blankly; "and shall we have to go away from
Three Chimneys and the Railway and everything?"</p>

<p>"No, no, darling," said Mother, hurriedly.</p>

<p>"The Hospital is called Three Chimneys Hospital," said the old
gentleman, "and my unlucky Jim's the only patient, and I hope he'll
continue to be so. Your Mother will be Matron, and there'll be a
hospital staff of a housemaid and a cook&mdash;till Jim's
well."</p>

<p>"And then will Mother go on writing again?" asked Peter.</p>

<p>"We shall see," said the old gentleman, with a slight, swift
glance at Bobbie; "perhaps something nice may happen and she won't
have to."</p>

<p>"I love my writing," said Mother, very quickly.</p>

<p>"I know," said the old gentleman; "don't be afraid that I'm
going to try to interfere. But one never knows. Very wonderful and
beautiful things do happen, don't they? And we live most of our
lives in the hope of them. I may come again to see the boy?"</p>

<p>"Surely," said Mother, "and I don't know how to thank you for
making it possible for me to nurse him. Dear boy!"</p>

<p>"He kept calling Mother, Mother, in the night," said Phyllis. "I
woke up twice and heard him."</p>

<p>"He didn't mean me," said Mother, in a low voice to the old
gentleman; "that's why I wanted so much to keep him."</p>

<p>The old gentleman rose.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," said Peter, "that you're going to keep him,
Mother."</p>

<p>"Take care of your Mother, my dears," said the old gentleman.
"She's a woman in a million."</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't she?" whispered Bobbie.</p>

<p>"God bless her," said the old gentleman, taking both Mother's
hands, "God bless her! Ay, and she shall be blessed. Dear me,
where's my hat? Will Bobbie come with me to the gate?"</p>

<p>At the gate he stopped and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're a good child, my dear&mdash;I got your letter. But it
wasn't needed. When I read about your Father's case in the papers
at the time, I had my doubts. And ever since I've known who you
were, I've been trying to find out things. I haven't done very much
yet. But I have hopes, my dear&mdash;I have hopes."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Bobbie, choking a little.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I may say great hopes. But keep your secret a little
longer. Wouldn't do to upset your Mother with a false hope, would
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but it isn't false!" said Bobbie; "I <i>know</i> you can do
it. I knew you could when I wrote. It isn't a false hope, is
it?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I don't think it's a false hope, or I wouldn't
have told you. And I think you deserve to be told that there
<i>is</i> a hope."</p>

<p>"And you don't think Father did it, do you? Oh, say you don't
think he did."</p>

<p>"My dear," he said, "I'm perfectly <i>certain</i> he
didn't."</p>

<p>If it was a false hope, it was none the less a very radiant one
that lay warm at Bobbie's heart, and through the days that followed
lighted her little face as a Japanese lantern is lighted by the
candle within.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV. The End.</h2>

<p>Life at the Three Chimneys was never quite the same again after
the old gentleman came to see his grandson. Although they now knew
his name, the children never spoke of him by it&mdash;at any rate,
when they were by themselves. To them he was always the old
gentleman, and I think he had better be the old gentleman to us,
too. It wouldn't make him seem any more real to you, would it, if I
were to tell you that his name was Snooks or Jenkins (which it
wasn't)?&mdash;and, after all, I must be allowed to keep one
secret. It's the only one; I have told you everything else, except
what I am going to tell you in this chapter, which is the last. At
least, of course, I haven't told you <i>everything</i>. If I were
to do that, the book would never come to an end, and that would be
a pity, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Well, as I was saying, life at Three Chimneys was never quite
the same again. The cook and the housemaid were very nice (I don't
mind telling you their names&mdash;they were Clara and Ethelwyn),
but they told Mother they did not seem to want Mrs. Viney, and that
she was an old muddler. So Mrs. Viney came only two days a week to
do washing and ironing. Then Clara and Ethelwyn said they could do
the work all right if they weren't interfered with, and that meant
that the children no longer got the tea and cleared it away and
washed up the tea-things and dusted the rooms.</p>

<p>This would have left quite a blank in their lives, although they
had often pretended to themselves and to each other that they hated
housework. But now that Mother had no writing and no housework to
do, she had time for lessons. And lessons the children had to do.
However nice the person who is teaching you may be, lessons are
lessons all the world over, and at their best are worse fun than
peeling potatoes or lighting a fire.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if Mother now had time for lessons, she also
had time for play, and to make up little rhymes for the children as
she used to do. She had not had much time for rhymes since she came
to Three Chimneys.</p>

<p>There was one very odd thing about these lessons. Whatever the
children were doing, they always wanted to be doing something else.
When Peter was doing his Latin, he thought it would be nice to be
learning History like Bobbie. Bobbie would have preferred
Arithmetic, which was what Phyllis happened to be doing, and
Phyllis of course thought Latin much the most interesting kind of
lesson. And so on.</p>

<p>So, one day, when they sat down to lessons, each of them found a
little rhyme at its place. I put the rhymes in to show you that
their Mother really did understand a little how children feel about
things, and also the kind of words they use, which is the case with
very few grown-up people. I suppose most grown-ups have very bad
memories, and have forgotten how they felt when they were little.
Of course, the verses are supposed to be spoken by the
children.</p>

<p>PETER<br>
<br>
I once thought Caesar easy pap&mdash;<br>
How very soft I must have been!<br>
When they start Caesar with a chap<br>
He little know what that will mean.<br>
Oh, verbs are silly stupid things.<br>
I'd rather learn the dates of kings!<br>
<br>
BOBBIE<br>
<br>
The worst of all my lesson things<br>
Is learning who succeeded who<br>
In all the rows of queens and kings,<br>
With dates to everything they do:<br>
With dates enough to make you sick;&mdash;<br>
I wish it was Arithmetic!<br>
<br>
PHYLLIS<br>
<br>
Such pounds and pounds of apples fill<br>
My slate&mdash;what is the price you'd spend?<br>
You scratch the figures out until<br>
You cry upon the dividend.<br>
I'd break the slate and scream for joy<br>
If I did Latin like a boy!<br></p>

<p>This kind of thing, of course, made lessons much jollier. It is
something to know that the person who is teaching you sees that it
is not all plain sailing for you, and does not think that it is
just your stupidness that makes you not know your lessons till
you've learned them!</p>

<p>Then as Jim's leg got better it was very pleasant to go up and
sit with him and hear tales about his school life and the other
boys. There was one boy, named Parr, of whom Jim seemed to have
formed the lowest possible opinion, and another boy named Wigsby
Minor, for whose views Jim had a great respect. Also there were
three brothers named Paley, and the youngest was called Paley
Terts, and was much given to fighting.</p>

<p>Peter drank in all this with deep joy, and Mother seemed to have
listened with some interest, for one day she gave Jim a sheet of
paper on which she had written a rhyme about Parr, bringing in
Paley and Wigsby by name in a most wonderful way, as well as all
the reasons Jim had for not liking Parr, and Wigsby's wise opinion
on the matter. Jim was immensely pleased. He had never had a rhyme
written expressly for him before. He read it till he knew it by
heart and then he sent it to Wigsby, who liked it almost as much as
Jim did. Perhaps you may like it, too.</p>

<blockquote>THE NEW BOY<br>
<br>
His name is Parr: he says that he<br>
Is given bread and milk for tea.<br>
He says his father killed a bear.<br>
He says his mother cuts his hair.<br>
<br>
He wears goloshes when it's wet.<br>
I've heard his people call him "Pet"!<br>
He has no proper sense of shame;<br>
He told the chaps his Christian name.<br>
<br>
He cannot wicket-keep at all,<br>
He's frightened of a cricket ball.<br>
He reads indoors for hours and hours.<br>
He knows the names of beastly flowers.<br>
<br>
He says his French just like Mossoo&mdash;<br>
A beastly stuck-up thing to do&mdash;<br>
He won't keep <i>cave</i>, shirks his turn<br>
And says he came to school to learn!<br>
<br>
He won't play football, says it hurts;<br>
He wouldn't fight with Paley Terts;<br>
He couldn't whistle if he tried,<br>
And when we laughed at him he cried!<br>
<br>
Now Wigsby Minor says that Parr<br>
Is only like all new boys are.<br>
I know when <i>I</i> first came to school<br>
I wasn't such a jolly fool!</blockquote>

<p>Jim could never understand how Mother could have been clever
enough to do it. To the others it seemed nice, but natural. You see
they had always been used to having a mother who could write verses
just like the way people talk, even to the shocking expression at
the end of the rhyme, which was Jim's very own.</p>

<p>Jim taught Peter to play chess and draughts and dominoes, and
altogether it was a nice quiet time.</p>

<p>Only Jim's leg got better and better, and a general feeling
began to spring up among Bobbie, Peter, and Phyllis that something
ought to be done to amuse him; not just games, but something really
handsome. But it was extraordinarily difficult to think of
anything.</p>

<p>"It's no good," said Peter, when all of them had thought and
thought till their heads felt quite heavy and swollen; "if we can't
think of anything to amuse him, we just can't, and there's an end
of it. Perhaps something will just happen of its own accord that
he'll like."</p>

<p>"Things <i>do</i> happen by themselves sometimes, without your
making them," said Phyllis, rather as though, usually, everything
that happened in the world was her doing.</p>

<p>"I wish something would happen," said Bobbie, dreamily,
"something wonderful."</p>

<p>And something wonderful did happen exactly four days after she
had said this. I wish I could say it was three days after, because
in fairy tales it is always three days after that things happen.
But this is not a fairy story, and besides, it really was four and
not three, and I am nothing if not strictly truthful.</p>

<p>They seemed to be hardly Railway children at all in those days,
and as the days went on each had an uneasy feeling about this which
Phyllis expressed one day.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the Railway misses us," she said, plaintively. "We
never go to see it now."</p>

<p>"It seems ungrateful," said Bobbie; "we loved it so when we
hadn't anyone else to play with."</p>

<p>"Perks is always coming up to ask after Jim," said Peter, "and
the signalman's little boy is better. He told me so."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean the people," explained Phyllis; "I meant the dear
Railway itself."</p>

<p>"The thing I don't like," said Bobbie, on this fourth day, which
was a Tuesday, "is our having stopped waving to the 9.15 and
sending our love to Father by it."</p>

<p>"Let's begin again," said Phyllis. And they did.</p>

<p>Somehow the change of everything that was made by having
servants in the house and Mother not doing any writing, made the
time seem extremely long since that strange morning at the
beginning of things, when they had got up so early and burnt the
bottom out of the kettle and had apple pie for breakfast and first
seen the Railway.</p>

<p>It was September now, and the turf on the slope to the Railway
was dry and crisp. Little long grass spikes stood up like bits of
gold wire, frail blue harebells trembled on their tough, slender
stalks, Gipsy roses opened wide and flat their lilac-coloured
discs, and the golden stars of St. John's Wort shone at the edges
of the pool that lay halfway to the Railway. Bobbie gathered a
generous handful of the flowers and thought how pretty they would
look lying on the green-and-pink blanket of silk-waste that now
covered Jim's poor broken leg.</p>

<p>"Hurry up," said Peter, "or we shall miss the 9.15!"</p>

<p>"I can't hurry more than I am doing," said Phyllis. "Oh, bother
it! My bootlace has come undone <i>again</i>!"</p>

<p>"When you're married," said Peter, "your bootlace will come
undone going up the church aisle, and your man that you're going to
get married to will tumble over it and smash his nose in on the
ornamented pavement; and then you'll say you won't marry him, and
you'll have to be an old maid."</p>

<p>"I shan't," said Phyllis. "I'd much rather marry a man with his
nose smashed in than not marry anybody."</p>

<p>"It would be horrid to marry a man with a smashed nose, all the
same," went on Bobbie. "He wouldn't be able to smell the flowers at
the wedding. Wouldn't that be awful!"</p>

<p>"Bother the flowers at the wedding!" cried Peter. "Look! the
signal's down. We must run!"</p>

<p>They ran. And once more they waved their handkerchiefs, without
at all minding whether the handkerchiefs were clean or not, to the
9.15.</p>

<p>"Take our love to Father!" cried Bobbie. And the others, too,
shouted:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take our love to Father!"</p>

<p>The old gentleman waved from his first-class carriage window.
Quite violently he waved. And there was nothing odd in that, for he
always had waved. But what was really remarkable was that from
every window handkerchiefs fluttered, newspapers signalled, hands
waved wildly. The train swept by with a rustle and roar, the little
pebbles jumped and danced under it as it passed, and the children
were left looking at each other.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Peter.</p>

<p>"<i>Well</i>!" said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"<i>Well</i>!" said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"Whatever on earth does that mean?" asked Peter, but he did not
expect any answer.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't know," said Bobbie. "Perhaps the old gentleman
told the people at his station to look out for us and wave. He knew
we should like it!"</p>

<p>Now, curiously enough, this was just what had happened. The old
gentleman, who was very well known and respected at his particular
station, had got there early that morning, and he had waited at the
door where the young man stands holding the interesting machine
that clips the tickets, and he had said something to every single
passenger who passed through that door. And after nodding to what
the old gentleman had said&mdash;and the nods expressed every shade
of surprise, interest, doubt, cheerful pleasure, and grumpy
agreement&mdash; each passenger had gone on to the platform and
read one certain part of his newspaper. And when the passengers got
into the train, they had told the other passengers who were already
there what the old gentleman had said, and then the other
passengers had also looked at their newspapers and seemed very
astonished and, mostly, pleased. Then, when the train passed the
fence where the three children were, newspapers and hands and
handkerchiefs were waved madly, till all that side of the train was
fluttery with white like the pictures of the King's Coronation in
the biograph at Maskelyne and Cook's. To the children it almost
seemed as though the train itself was alive, and was at last
responding to the love that they had given it so freely and so
long.</p>

<p>"It is most extraordinarily rum!" said Peter.</p>

<p>"Most stronery!" echoed Phyllis.</p>

<p>But Bobbie said, "Don't you think the old gentleman's waves
seemed more significating than usual?"</p>

<p>"No," said the others.</p>

<p>"I do," said Bobbie. "I thought he was trying to explain
something to us with his newspaper."</p>

<p>"Explain what?" asked Peter, not unnaturally.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't know," Bobbie answered, "but I do feel most
awfully funny. I feel just exactly as if something was going to
happen."</p>

<p>"What is going to happen," said Peter, "is that Phyllis's
stocking is going to come down."</p>

<p>This was but too true. The suspender had given way in the
agitation of the waves to the 9.15. Bobbie's handkerchief served as
first aid to the injured, and they all went home.</p>

<p>Lessons were more than usually difficult to Bobbie that day.
Indeed, she disgraced herself so deeply over a quite simple sum
about the division of 48 pounds of meat and 36 pounds of bread
among 144 hungry children that Mother looked at her anxiously.</p>

<p>"Don't you feel quite well, dear?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," was Bobbie's unexpected answer. "I don't know
how I feel. It isn't that I'm lazy. Mother, will you let me off
lessons to-day? I feel as if I wanted to be quite alone by
myself."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I'll let you off," said Mother; "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bobbie dropped her slate. It cracked just across the little
green mark that is so useful for drawing patterns round, and it was
never the same slate again. Without waiting to pick it up she
bolted. Mother caught her in the hall feeling blindly among the
waterproofs and umbrellas for her garden hat.</p>

<p>"What is it, my sweetheart?" said Mother. "You don't feel ill,
do you?"</p>

<p>"I <i>don't</i> know," Bobbie answered, a little breathlessly,
"but I want to be by myself and see if my head really <i>is</i> all
silly and my inside all squirmy-twisty."</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better lie down?" Mother said, stroking her hair
back from her forehead.</p>

<p>"I'd be more alive in the garden, I think," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>But she could not stay in the garden. The hollyhocks and the
asters and the late roses all seemed to be waiting for something to
happen. It was one of those still, shiny autumn days, when
everything does seem to be waiting.</p>

<p>Bobbie could not wait.</p>

<p>"I'll go down to the station," she said, "and talk to Perks and
ask about the signalman's little boy."</p>

<p>So she went down. On the way she passed the old lady from the
Post-office, who gave her a kiss and a hug, but, rather to Bobbie's
surprise, no words except:&mdash;</p>

<p>"God bless you, love&mdash;" and, after a pause, "run
along&mdash;do."</p>

<p>The draper's boy, who had sometimes been a little less than
civil and a little more than contemptuous, now touched his cap, and
uttered the remarkable words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Morning, Miss, I'm sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>The blacksmith, coming along with an open newspaper in his hand,
was even more strange in his manner. He grinned broadly, though, as
a rule, he was a man not given to smiles, and waved the newspaper
long before he came up to her. And as he passed her, he said, in
answer to her "Good morning":&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good morning to you, Missie, and many of them! I wish you joy,
that I do!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Bobbie to herself, and her heart quickened its beats,
"something <i>is</i> going to happen! I know it is&mdash;everyone
is so odd, like people are in dreams."</p>

<p>The Station Master wrung her hand warmly. In fact he worked it
up and down like a pump-handle. But he gave her no reason for this
unusually enthusiastic greeting. He only said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The 11.54's a bit late, Miss&mdash;the extra luggage this
holiday time," and went away very quickly into that inner Temple of
his into which even Bobbie dared not follow him.</p>

<p>Perks was not to be seen, and Bobbie shared the solitude of the
platform with the Station Cat. This tortoiseshell lady, usually of
a retiring disposition, came to-day to rub herself against the
brown stockings of Bobbie with arched back, waving tail, and
reverberating purrs.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Bobbie, stooping to stroke her, "how very kind
everybody is to-day&mdash;even you, Pussy!"</p>

<p>Perks did not appear until the 11.54 was signalled, and then he,
like everybody else that morning, had a newspaper in his hand.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he said, "'ere you are. Well, if <i>this</i> is the
train, it'll be smart work! Well, God bless you, my dear! I see it
in the paper, and I don't think I was ever so glad of anything in
all my born days!" He looked at Bobbie a moment, then said, "One I
must have, Miss, and no offence, I know, on a day like this 'ere!"
and with that he kissed her, first on one cheek and then on the
other.</p>

<p>"You ain't offended, are you?" he asked anxiously. "I ain't took
too great a liberty? On a day like this, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Bobbie, "of course it's not a liberty, dear Mr.
Perks; we love you quite as much as if you were an uncle of
ours&mdash; but&mdash;on a day like <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"Like this 'ere!" said Perks. "Don't I tell you I see it in the
paper?"</p>

<p>"Saw <i>what</i> in the paper?" asked Bobbie, but already the
11.54 was steaming into the station and the Station Master was
looking at all the places where Perks was not and ought to have
been.</p>

<p>Bobbie was left standing alone, the Station Cat watching her
from under the bench with friendly golden eyes.</p>

<p>Of course you know already exactly what was going to happen.
Bobbie was not so clever. She had the vague, confused, expectant
feeling that comes to one's heart in dreams. What her heart
expected I can't tell&mdash;perhaps the very thing that you and I
know was going to happen&mdash;but her mind expected nothing; it
was almost blank, and felt nothing but tiredness and stupidness and
an empty feeling, like your body has when you have been a long walk
and it is very far indeed past your proper dinner-time.</p>

<p>Only three people got out of the 11.54. The first was a
countryman with two baskety boxes full of live chickens who stuck
their russet heads out anxiously through the wicker bars; the
second was Miss Peckitt, the grocer's wife's cousin, with a tin box
and three brown-paper parcels; and the third&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! my Daddy, my Daddy!" That scream went like a knife into the
heart of everyone in the train, and people put their heads out of
the windows to see a tall pale man with lips set in a thin close
line, and a little girl clinging to him with arms and legs, while
his arms went tightly round her.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>"I knew something wonderful was going to happen," said Bobbie,
as they went up the road, "but I didn't think it was going to be
this. Oh, my Daddy, my Daddy!"</p>

<p>"Then didn't Mother get my letter?" Father asked.</p>

<p>"There weren't any letters this morning. Oh! Daddy! it <i>is</i>
really you, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The clasp of a hand she had not forgotten assured her that it
was. "You must go in by yourself, Bobbie, and tell Mother quite
quietly that it's all right. They've caught the man who did it.
Everyone knows now that it wasn't your Daddy."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> always knew it wasn't," said Bobbie. "Me and Mother
and our old gentleman."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it's all his doing. Mother wrote and told me
you had found out. And she told me what you'd been to her. My own
little girl!" They stopped a minute then.</p>

<p>And now I see them crossing the field. Bobbie goes into the
house, trying to keep her eyes from speaking before her lips have
found the right words to "tell Mother quite quietly" that the
sorrow and the struggle and the parting are over and done, and that
Father has come home.</p>

<p>I see Father walking in the garden, waiting&mdash;waiting. He is
looking at the flowers, and each flower is a miracle to eyes that
all these months of Spring and Summer have seen only flagstones and
gravel and a little grudging grass. But his eyes keep turning
towards the house. And presently he leaves the garden and goes to
stand outside the nearest door. It is the back door, and across the
yard the swallows are circling. They are getting ready to fly away
from cold winds and keen frost to the land where it is always
summer. They are the same swallows that the children built the
little clay nests for.</p>

<p>Now the house door opens. Bobbie's voice calls:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come in, Daddy; come in!"</p>

<p>He goes in and the door is shut. I think we will not open the
door or follow him. I think that just now we are not wanted there.
I think it will be best for us to go quickly and quietly away. At
the end of the field, among the thin gold spikes of grass and the
harebells and Gipsy roses and St. John's Wort, we may just take one
last look, over our shoulders, at the white house where neither we
nor anyone else is wanted now.</p>
